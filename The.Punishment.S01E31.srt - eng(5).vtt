00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.030
How are the injured?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.590
Still unconscious.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.080
They were in emergency care last night,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.870
but they're now
out of life-threatening danger.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.280
Who's watching over them right now?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.190
Liu and Wen Bo.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.750
We found a cufflink at the scene.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.430
Take a look.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.760
This brand isn't cheap.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.750
It probably doesn't belong to the injured.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.150
It was most likely left behind
by the person

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.480
who kidnapped Fang Lei.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.600
Look into it.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.800
Fang Lei turned himself in.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.030
He's already been taken away
by the accident investigation team.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.800
When?

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:29.800
Just now.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.000
I'll head over there right away.
I have questions for him.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.430
Alright, I know what you want to ask.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.840
But the city hasn't given the green light.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.840
We can't have him transferred here.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.750
Fang Lei's phone.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.520
Director Yan went through a lot of trouble

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.650
to get the evidence transferred here.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.790
Did Fang Lei say anything?

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.750
He said that on the day Liu Yi died,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.840
he did see someone drive up.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.240
He took a photo,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.880
which is in his phone.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.370
Most importantly,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.860
he recognized the driver,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.400
a thug named Zheng Gao.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.400
However,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.560
this is only his side of the story.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.470
You need to verify everything
before taking action.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.270
Got it. Got it.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.890
Hurry up.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.840
Recover the data and investigate.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.090
I'm fine. I've been released.

at the fifth section

of the Hangang Center project.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.510
The accident resulted
in 7 injuries and no deaths.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.890
Two of the injured
were in serious condition,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.930
but after
the medical staff's full rescue efforts,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.270
they are now
out of life-threatening danger.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.430
After the accident occurred,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.080
the government attached great importance.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.540
Party Secretary Li Zheng

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.050
and Acting Mayor Hong Mushou

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.980
personally visited the scene
to deploy rescue work.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.430
Congratulations, Sir.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.920

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.800
That is what we should do.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.790
Thank you for your trust.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.620

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.740
Probably not well.

I didn't realize it until I checked—

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.130
this cufflink is incredibly expensive.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.190
Who bought it?

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.870
There's only one shop in all of Hanzhou
that sells this kind of cufflink.

have to do with me?

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.150
If you still don't release me,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.610
I'll sue him for violent law enforcement
and wrongful arrest.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.080
Who are you going to sue?

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.840
Him.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.270
and I'll help you file the case.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.660
I have witnesses.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.550
Many people saw it.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.930
Your arrest followed proper procedure.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.560
Don't try to weasel out of it.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.870
Where were you the day Liu Yi died?

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.910
At an internet café.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:44.510
Which one?

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.600
Xiangweiyuan.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.750
What were you doing there?

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.010
Surfing the internet.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.270
How long were you there?

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.000
All night.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.750
Did you leave in the middle?

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.210
I was there the whole time.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.320
So you know which day Liu Yi died, right?

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:59.390
No.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.920
I bought a monthly package.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.870
You lived at the internet café?

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.670
That's right.

You never went out?

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.910
I didn't go out all night.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.000
You never washed your face
or took a shower?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.460
Gaming is more important.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.080
Listen, there was surveillance video of me
the whole time.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.150
Hurry up and send someone to check.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.200
Once you're done checking,
I can hurry home.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.080
Go home?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.700
Who said you could go home?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.670
You can't go home.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.630
Well,

from our public security brigade

Come with us.

You guys are in cahoots.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.840
We never collude.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.660
Did I make you hit someone?

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.770
Did you do it yourself?

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.390
Or

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.130
Tianfei asked you to do it?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.320
What are you talking about?
I... I don't understand.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.270
You don't need to understand.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.270
Hurry up and take him away.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.030
Just looking at him is annoying.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.290
Change his handcuffs.

Captain Qin,
Chief Wei has news about Zheng Gao.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.560
This wound on Liu Yi...

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.420
looks a lot like He Gang's wound.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.150
Right?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.710
It resembles the style of Guazi.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.880
Fang Lei's words can't be trusted.

is just to mislead us.

Are we still arresting Zheng Gao?

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:19.850
Of course.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.080
Why not arrest him
when he's delivered to us?

that he's not the killer.

was using Zheng Gao to set us up.

what they were really up to,

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.710
see to your son's promotion.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:34.550
Then...

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.170
I'll give it a try.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.200
Mr. Liu is grooming you as his successor.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.740
We do exactly

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.490
what Uncle Tianye instructs.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:49.440
Good.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.730
I look forward

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.650
to our long-term collaboration.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.880
Try it.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.400
Dad.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.100
Wait.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.400
Excuse me for a moment.

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.060
Okay. Okay.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.440
Why are you here?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.480
What are you doing here?

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.590
Can't I come take a look?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.830
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.510
I'm busy here.
Why are you causing trouble?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.510
Go home right now!

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.640
What took you so long?

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.160
Uncle.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.800
What's up?

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.940
He snuck out by himself.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.470
I told him to study at home.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.240
Forget studying. He's already here.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.850
Let him see the world. Come on.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.080
What world does a kid need to see?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.060
Zhang.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.240
Here. Let me introduce someone to you.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.790
This is Editor-in-Chief Zhang,
the most knowledgeable in all of Hanzhou.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.180
This is my nephew, Zhao Wenxuan.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.070
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.110
Nice to meet you.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.130
He's about to graduate.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.680
You know some people
at the Education Bureau, right?

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.620
Help him.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.130
Get me a drink.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.680
What do you want to do in the future,
young man?

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.440
He wants
to take the postgraduate entrance exam.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.750
I want to join our company.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.400
Join our company?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.010
Have a drink with him first.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.440
He's just a kid.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.750
He can't drink. He can't drink.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.110
It's fine. Having a little is fine.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.640
I'll drink for him. Come on.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.720
So you want to join our company, right?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.030
After finishing this drink,
you're not needed here.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.560
You guys carry on chatting.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.350
We at Tianyun want him. Okay?

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.310
What's the point?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.680
With his current grades,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.790
he's not qualified to join Tianyun.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.400
He should focus on his postgraduate exams.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.270
Congratulations.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.870
Thank you.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.200
-Isn't it more reassuring if he joins us?
-Tianye.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200
Jiangyan is here.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.510
Don't listen to your father.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.310
That's just unnecessary worry.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.190
Come here.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.830
Don't say too many harsh words.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:18.440
I know.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.110
Come here.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.170
What are you doing?

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:22.410
Tianye.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.410
What took you so long?

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.350
What happened?

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.410
Congratulations.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.200
She was getting dressed up.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.880
I rushed her a few times
but couldn't get her moving.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.590
What's wrong with getting dressed up?
Doesn't she look good?

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.250
Today is my brother's big day.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.820
Of course I should prepare properly.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.020
We're all family. There's no need to...

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.530
prepare.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.920
Come on. Let's go inside.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.850
Come in, please.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.070
Ziyi,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.160
where's Baoying?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.030
He's upstairs.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.600
Who told you to come here?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.410
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.150
I can't just study all the time.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.550
I can't depend on you forever.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.480
What do you mean?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.490
You think I can't support you?

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.550
Dad.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.450
Can you tone down the dad vibes?

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.420
Let me tell you.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.400
I don't care what you do in the future.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.030
Civil service exam, postgraduate studies,
studying abroad—it's all fine.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.030
I'll support you.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.840
Even doing nothing is okay.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.750
But you just can't join Tianyun.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.400
Why?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.160
No reason.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.790
Eat first.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.840
Go home after the meal.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.270
Come here.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.790
Wait.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.270
Do you have to say it now?

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.920
Jiajun,

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:18.880
back then, you promised

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.440
that pork prices would fall.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.750
Here, take a look yourself.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.400
Look how much they've risen.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.600
Keep your voice down.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.110
Listen,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.750
I lost money too.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.920
Futures trading is always high-risk.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.550
Besides,

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.270
you said you wanted to make money.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.440
That's why I brought you into this.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.500
It's not about making money anymore.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.920
I'll be honest with you.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
The company has no money left.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.060
You have to save me.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.640
Fine, I'll figure something out later.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.420
Do it now.
I'm waiting for you to save my life!

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.200
Tell Tianye.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.220
Listen.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.510
If you tell him

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.640
about our business deal, you're dead.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.620
Keep your mouth shut.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.240
If there's no other way,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.440
just go back to the smuggling business.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:07.590
Smuggling?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.440
Tianye said

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.680
we can never touch that.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.120
Then do it secretly.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.880
I'll invest some money.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.750
Count me as a shareholder.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:16.920
We'll make money together.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.510
You said it yourself.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.110
Jiajun.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:19.880
Mr. Liu.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.270
Mr. Wei, you're here too.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.440
Wei, that's it for today.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.400
I still have something to attend to.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.640
I'm heading over there first.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.270
Let's have a drink later.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.070
Okay. Okay.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.640
Tianfei,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.920
there were too many people earlier,
so I didn't go to you.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.980
About that matter—

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.160
it didn't work out.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.560
I know it didn't work out.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.670
You saw the statement
the police issued, right?

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:37.310
Yes.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.120
I didn't expect the police to be prepared.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.220
Here's what you do.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.400
Find more people,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.110
stir this up some more,

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.690
and make a bigger commotion.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.760
I think we should drop this.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.640
If this goes on, we'll break the law.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.480
What law?

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.790
What law?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.720
Do you understand public opinion?

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.320
We need to muddy the waters.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.110
Fine.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.070
I'll introduce people to you.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.240
As for the specifics,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.040
you discuss with them yourself.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.590
Okay. Okay.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.310
If this works out,

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.090
I'll buy you drinks later.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.310
Bottoms up.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:27.460
Bottoms up.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.950
Drink whatever you like.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.060
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.610
Let's finish it together.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.810
Have fun, everyone.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.890
Everyone's here.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.000
Feng.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.410
What's the meaning of this?

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.940
You weren't invited today.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.940
Why are you here?

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.520
I came back to my home to have a meal.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.430
Do I need to report to you?

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.240
Your home?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.550
You're neither from Longwan

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.830
nor from Tianyun.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.050
Listen.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.720
Don't embarrass yourself.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.580
You're not welcome here.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.270
Leave now.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.570
Tianfei,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.700
when you're out there,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.180
you should know your place
and show respect.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.500
Have some manners.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.340
You're not behaving well.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.550
Tianye.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:33.990
I came for a meal.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.400
That's okay, right?

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.170
Anytime.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.030
You can come back to eat
whenever you want.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.720
Great.

Tianfei,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.530
the guy they arrested the other day...

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.440
Zheng Gao—

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.450
he's your friend, isn't he?

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.440
I don't know him.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.570
You don't know him?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.270
He was your buddy when fighting,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.260
but when he's in trouble,
you don't know him?

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.560
You're such a jerk.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:02.680
Tianye,

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.110
you got yourself a godson?

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.170
Congratulations.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:08.850
Come here.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.560
Come here.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.200
Call him Uncle Feng.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:15.530
Uncle Feng.

Come.

You're getting more handsome.

I need to call a friend here.

It's me.

I'd like to report something.

At the Hanzhou Club,

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.510

Please come over.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.480
Okay.

I'm off duty today.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.980
Do whatever

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.030
you need to do.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.930
You are Ding Baoshuai, right?

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.530
Is this cufflink yours?

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.960
Yes.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.240
We suspect you are involved
in a serious assault case.

Please come with us
to assist in the investigation.

What's going on?

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:32.680
Nothing.

What are you doing?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.160
I'd like to see
who dares to take him away today.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:46.960
What are you doing?

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.620
Do you want to come with us too?

I'm sorry, officer.

Everyone, sit down.

Qin Feng, what do you mean?

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.240
You're here to cause trouble, is that it?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.640
You won't rest until you

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.840
break this family apart, is that right?

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.640
You ungrateful traitor.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.240
Tianfei,

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.440
I just told you

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.350
you should follow the rules
when you're out there.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.750
Don't be disrespectful.

You think being a cop makes you so great?

This isn't over, Qin Feng!

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.760
What kind of upbringing is this?

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.480
If you wanted the person,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.010
you could have just told me.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.590
Why make it so awkward
and embarrass ourselves

in front of everyone?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.310
Tianye,

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.030
it's not that I didn't want to tell you.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.790
It's that telling you wouldn't help.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.300
Besides, these matters

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.350
aren't my responsibility.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.980
I was just passing by today

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.170
and ran into him.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.680
And I was just fulfilling my duty...

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.680
as a citizen.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.920
If you were just passing by,

you could've just come to eat.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.790
You didn't have to fulfill any duty.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:32.400
No problem.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.600
The bosses are all here.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.520
I rarely get to see you.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.910
Then today, at Tianye's place,

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.240
I'm taking the chance to report to you.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.110
Recently,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.510
in Hanzhou,

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.350
too many things have happened.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.480
One after another.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.750
And our public security organs

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.200
are under great pressure.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.800
But we are also doing our best

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.780
to investigate

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.360
and arrest suspects.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.590
We will find

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.030
the bad guys.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.380
So no one should take chances.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.780
I'm talking about Ding Baoshuai.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.030
How big a deal is his matter anyway?

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.960
Just a fight,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.720
right?

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.790
But if he should be arrested, he will be.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.750
No other way.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.240
You see, with my profession,

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.240
I can't stand any dirt in my eyes.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.730
It's never easy for a cop

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.000
to work a case involving family.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.730
You can understand, right?

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.930
It's good that you understand.

About Baoshuai's matter,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.010

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.500
Okay, go ahead.

of everything outside.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:56.260
As for Baoshuai's matter,

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.400
how do you plan to handle it?

I found a fall guy.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.980
I also talked to Director Peng.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.640
We'll get him released first.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:04.160
Tianye,

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:06.330
what Feng did today

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.670
is a declaration of war against us.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.520
Regarding the port accident,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.750
he's somewhat suspicious.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.480
But there's no solid evidence.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.920
But Liu Yi's body
has nothing to do with us.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.800
Don't worry.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:20.360
Alright.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.680
Think carefully.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.760
Think clearly before you speak.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.070
Right now,
it's not about me thinking clearly.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.720
It's about you listening carefully.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.830
I've told you many times.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.000
I was drunk those days.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I lost the cufflink a long time ago.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.270
Where I lost it, who picked it up—

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.220
I have no idea.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.200
Which days exactly?

Tell me, how did Ding Xiaoshuai

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.500
become like this?

are they behind them?

What show are they putting on?

Absolutely brilliant.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.710
Someone just turned himself in.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.440
He said Fang Lei owed him money.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.630
When they went to collect the debt
from Fang Lei,

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.429
they injured Fang Lei's driver.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.500
They even have an IOU.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.860
And that cufflink.

they stole it

The arrest of Zheng Gao

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.560
was all over the news.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.190
Now Ding Baoshuai's matter has turned out

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:34.650
to be a misunderstanding.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.500
Tell me,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.800
how much pressure from the higher-ups

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.670
have I been shielding you from?

Regarding Zheng Gao's matter before,

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:41.840
I was also responsible.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:43.610
But Director Peng,

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.610
don't you find it strange?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I suggest we thoroughly investigate

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.550
that person who turned himself in.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.030
Why did he suddenly confess?

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.070
He even came
with a complete evidence chain.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.000
We don't even need to investigate.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.590
In all my years as a detective,

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:56.510
this is the first time
I've seen something like this.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.570
Investigate then.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.940
Of course we can investigate.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:01.320
But...

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.960
can we

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.360
release Ding Baoshuai first?

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.590
At least for now,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.330
he's not the prime suspect.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.530
Besides,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.840
you've questioned

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.510
and interrogated him for so long,

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.230
but you
haven't gotten anything substantial.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.230
We can't keep holding him like this.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.080
Here, come on.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.050

the responsibility

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.550
doesn't lie entirely with you.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.680
It's mainly because

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.130
your subordinates

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.000
weren't careful enough

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.550
and were too impulsive.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.480
When you go back,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.860
tighten up

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.880

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.230
Discipline them when needed.

he has great potential,

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.170
but without proper guidance,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.550
he'll grow wild

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.940
and never become successful.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.310

Mr. Xu.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:42.320
How did those two end up together?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.190
Mr. Xu is not just close to Mr. Wei.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.530
He also frequently visits Mr. Liu's bar.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.190
Uncle Tianye,

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.390
should I look into it?

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:48.930
No need.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.630
You rest first.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.830
Go back and spend time with Xiaomei.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:51.830
Ba will handle it.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:53.570
But this matter

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.960
must be kept confidential.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.690
Understood.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.000
Come on.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.380
Cheers! Cheers!

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.960
Cheers! Cheers!

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.630
Do you know this game? 15, 20.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.150
15, 20, 15.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.450
Are you blind?

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.880
I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.400
Sorry?

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.740
Are your eyes just for breathing?

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:27.710
Do you need me
to help you cross the street?

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:28.970
I just bumped into you.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:30.370
Can you not touch me?

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.710
I touched you?

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.880
You can't accept it, huh?

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.620
I gave you a chance, but you're useless!
