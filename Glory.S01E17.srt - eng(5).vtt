Miss Xiu Qiong.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.380
Don't throw them away.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.479
These are all Mr. Lu's
treasured possessions.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.430
I don't care about any Mr. Lu

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.150
or whoever.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.200
Go burn these things somewhere far away.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.460
Don't dirty the Rong family's property.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.560
Lady Shanbao isn't receiving visitors.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560
Please leave now.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.200
Mr. Lu has risked his life

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
for Lady Shanbao

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.480
many times.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520
Surely that counts for something.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.560
To hastily drive him away

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.880
based on a few slanderous words—

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.340
isn't that too heartless?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.800
Mr. Bai,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.400
Lady Shanbao is not a rash person.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.800
When I was imprisoned before,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.930
no one could save me.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.150
Mr. Lu came to my aid in that crisis.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.480
How righteous was that?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.470
Could he do something

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650
as terrible as abandoning
his wife and child?

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.710
I don't believe it.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.840
No matter what you say,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.130
I still won't believe it.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.990
I'll go find him

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.450
and get to the bottom of this.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.650
I advise you not to go.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460
Mr. Bai, you're due for
the imperial exams next year.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.960
Today is your

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.470
day to return to the academy.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.310
Old Madam Rong said

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.190
you must earn an official title

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.190
to be worthy of Lady Yunshu in the future.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.560
If you

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.910
speak up for this criminal today,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.190
aren't you afraid of angering Old Madam

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.320
and ruining your promising marriage?

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.079
He makes sense.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.040
No need for you. I'll go find him myself.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.000
Yan Bailou, you're so confused.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.710
A true man knows
what to do and what not to do.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.400
You know that woman's
origins are suspicious

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.280
and Mr. Lu might be wrongfully accused.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.430
How can you abandon and ignore him

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.030
because of your jealous, selfish heart?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.030
What you're doing

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.920
truly violates the way of a gentleman.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.250
I cannot agree with you.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.490
Mr. Yan, wait for me.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.450
I'll go with you.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.800
Don't.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.079
If you go,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.430
you'll only increase
Old Madam's resentment

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.090
and make the situation worse.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.750
Return to the academy as planned.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.960
I will certainly find him

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.960
and send you word.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.250
Don't worry.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.960
If he's truly innocent,

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.010
who would deliberately frame him?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.050
How foolish.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.430
Lady Shanbao, that Mr. Yan

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.310
seems to be a gentleman.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.680
My cousin has become
increasingly narrow-minded.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.740
I've sent several letters to my uncle

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.350
but received no reply so far.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.910
I fear my aunt is
intentionally blocking them.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.040
Send someone to Ningzhou with a letter

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.560
to urge the Wen family
to come pick him up soon.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.030
Yes.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.160
Go.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.100

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.070
Come.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.240
You may go now.

Thank you, sir.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.090
Get out quickly.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.830
Let's go.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.040
Kill him!

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.460
Take him away.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.920
Young Master, you've suffered.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.800
How did you know

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.260
I had men waiting outside?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.750
Who do you think Lady Shanbao is?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.520
She's not easily fooled.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.630
When you tapped me lightly during the day,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.080
I knew exactly what was happening.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.870
It was a trap to catch them all.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.160
That's hard to say.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.920
When you were young,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.390
you traveled to study in many places.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.830
You lived at Dongquan Academy
in Qingzhou for a whole year.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.950
Whether you deceived someone
into marriage and had children

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.210
is difficult to verify

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.610
with such great distance.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.740
That's impossible.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.120
I have extremely high standards

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.630
and even higher ambitions.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.320
I must find one
who satisfies me in every way.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.660
Otherwise, I'd rather remain alone forever

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.860
than settle for less

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.690
and end up despising each other.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.250
Rushing into marriage
only to regret it later

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.640
is something I absolutely would never do.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.040
So, which one have you set your sights on?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.480
Move!

How dare you privately imprison
an official of the Prefect!

One causing grave injury to their master

first receives 100 strokes,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.310
then be exiled to three thousand li away.

As a clerk,

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.510
conspiring with others
to harm your superiors

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.950
is an even more serious crime.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.560
I was planning
to deal with current matters

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.160
before settling old scores.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.790
But you've delivered
yourself to my doorstep.

You could beat me to death
and get nothing!

With such solid evidence,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.120
why would I need to interrogate you?

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.630
Since you hid
in the Prefect's Government Office

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.470
the one secretly committing murder

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.130
must be Xu Song without doubt.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.240
Though he has some friction with me,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.570
it wouldn't lead to risking
the murder of an imperial envoy.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.620
Unless...

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.850
he is deeply implicated
in the old Wei family case.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.180
When he heard about
opening Madam Yang's coffin,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.270
he became completely distraught

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.110
and committed murder.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.940
As I suspect,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.080

lost their lives at his hands.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.170
After he receives 100 strokes,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.790
give him one bowl of plain congee a day

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.960
to keep him alive.

The 3,000 cuts at the execution ground

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.180
are still waiting for him.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.220
I'll talk! I'll tell everything!

to commit these terrible deeds!

My Lord, spare my life! My Lord!

It was Lord Xu who made me

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.030
commit these heinous crimes!

this villain is cruel and vicious.

We can't let him off easy.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.600
I'll come every day

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.130
to give him 30 or 50 strokes,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.600
just not letting him die.

Don't worry. I'll keep it in mind.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.600
Search.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.450
Turn Linji upside down if you have to.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.720
Alive or dead, I must see the body!

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.320
Yes.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.750
Your Lordship appreciates Clerk Qing's

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.610
loyal service,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.240
naturally bestowed him generous rewards

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.790
and exceptional promotion.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.200
But he rose from humble origins

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.400
and lacks foresight.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.550
That person is now
hiding in the Rong family.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.790
We need a foolproof plan

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:05.650
to lure him out,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.380
so we leave no evidence

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.520
and eliminate the threat completely.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.860
If he acts hastily out of anxiety,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.780
I fear he might alert our target,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.840
implicating Your Lordship

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.510
and causing endless trouble.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.870
Useless fool!

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.670
The Rong family.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.560
It's the Rong family again!

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.240
During my time in office,
I've benefited this region.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.840
Receiving some tribute from tea merchants

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.870
is only proper.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.030
But this Rong family
refuses to show respect.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.910
Every year, leading those ignorant

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.110
mountain folk to cause trouble with me,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.640
even daring to attack
the imperial tax officers—

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.080
they show me no regard at all!

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.770
Brilliant.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.580
A perfect hiding place.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.510
If he dares to reveal his identity,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.000
it will give us the perfect excuse.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.890
I can then uproot the entire Rong family

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.570
and eliminate the threat forever.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.870
How wise, My Lord.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.790
Didn't she say she was only
going to check the shop?

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.590
Why isn't Lady Shanbao back yet?

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.000
Indeed.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.450
It's getting late.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.220
Young Master.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:09.990
The

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.730
rain outside is too heavy.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.270
Young Master, Lady Shanbao is back.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.670
Quickly, go inside.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.200
There's been constant thunder

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.050
and relentless rain these days.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.370
How dare you
go up the mountain in such weather?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.170
Are you trying to risk your life?

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.080
It's been raining heavily
for a day and night.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.720
Seeing that the rain wasn't letting up,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.480
I was worried something
might happen to the tea plantation,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.940
so I rushed there to check.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.980
I still need to go to Chongxi Hall.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.170
-Take it.
-Go in.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.110
Change into dry clothes before we talk.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.550
Xiu Qiong, have someone
prepare water quickly.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:06.510
Lady Shanbao needs to bathe.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.400
She's caught a chill.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.440
Also, call for a physician

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.750
to prescribe medicine
to induce sweat and drive out the cold.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.810
I'll go right away.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.150
Jun Dai,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.440
there's freshly brewed
ginger tea in the tea room.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440
Go get it quickly.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.820
If this rain doesn't stop,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.330
can the tea plantation hold up?

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.480
The two tea plantations
at the foot of the mountain are flooded.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.680
Along the riverbank,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.910
many tea seedlings in the flatlands

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.370
have been washed away too.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.550
Fortunately, I prepared early

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.390
and had people
raise the embankment beforehand,

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.790
so it's still holding up.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.080
But if this rain doesn't stop soon,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.680
forget about the autumn tea—

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.240
even next year's tea supply

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.370
will be in jeopardy.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.030
The Rong family's
responsibility is immense,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.890
and Lady Rong has invested so much
in nurturing you.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.870
You refuse to fail
everyone's expectations,

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.870
never uttering a word of complaint,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.270
always exerting yourself a hundredfold.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.070
Even ten men could not match you.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.360
I deeply admire you

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.910
and know I can't stop you,

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.920
but I have some heartfelt words to say.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.140
No matter how capable you are,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.120
you're still made of flesh and blood.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.240
You can't possibly
handle everything in the world.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.900
Others don't know your heart;

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.360
they'll only resent you
for being power-hungry

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.290
and autocratic.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.510
Who will feel grateful or remember

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.370
your kindness?

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.730
Even if you risk your life,

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.360
you may not escape sisters turning distant

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.090
or petty people betraying you.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.860
I don't need their gratitude.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.190
But do you know there are
people who care about you?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.510
I shouldn't interfere in this matter.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.640
Once I get involved,

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.480
you'll surely suspect
I have ulterior motives.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.010
But today I must intervene.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.120
You only know how to
cultivate and rescue tea,

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.480
but you don't know how to manage people.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.910
I manage thousands of mu
of tea plantations.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.960
How could I not know how to manage people?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.000
Then do you know
how to govern people's hearts

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.270
and make your sisters

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.750
behave properly and work together
in the future?

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.330
I do have a solution,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.800
but I need you to agree to one condition.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.440
What is it?

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.500
When two people spend every day together,

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.240
even if as close as lips and teeth,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.440
there will inevitably
be friction and stumbles.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.510
If I make mistakes in the future

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.000
and upset you,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.610
please remember all my good deeds today

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:00.740
and forgive me once.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.010
You can't hate me or resent me,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.630
and especially can't ignore me.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.250
Fine. I agree.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:16.270
Is the tea plantation

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.800
really that easy to manage?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.530
There are countless traps and troubles.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.990
Just let go a little first,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.349
let her feel smug

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.790
and do as she pleases.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.280
After a month or two,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.250
when she's suffered enough setbacks
and shown her weakness,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.180
then you'll see.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.240
Put it there.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.450
Usually by this time,

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.720
Lady Shanbao would have come to report.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.050
Today is quite strange.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.920
Hurry up and check on her.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.070
How dare she keep Grandmother waiting?

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.640
Yes.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.440
Don't worry, Grandmother.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.830
The mountain path
is difficult in this heavy rain.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.750
Lady Shanbao must have
been delayed by something.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.210
She'll be here any moment.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.880
Sorry I'm late, Grandmother.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.290
The wheels got stuck in the mud,

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:30.400
so I had to walk down the mountain.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.940
Fearing the dampness on me was too heavy

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.030
and might alarm you,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.030
so I went to clean up and change first.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.630
How is the plantation doing?

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.030
The rain is too heavy.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.920
Many tea seedlings were washed away.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.750
Fortunately,
we reinforced the embankments in advance,

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.110
saving all the plantations
at the foot of the mountain.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.720
But if this downpour continues,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.920
the waterlogged tea seedlings
will easily die.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.970
If the old tea trees
soak for several more days,

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.240
we won't be able
to harvest the autumn tea,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.040
and next year's tea will also...

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.110
She must have caught a chill in the rain.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.640
Lady Shanbao looks unwell.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.550
It's better not
to go up the mountain tomorrow.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.550
Exposure to wind and rain
will add more chill—

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.480
wouldn't that only make you worse?

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.480
That won't do.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.870
Grandmother,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.640
if the mountain tea plantation
suffers damage,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.310
it would be a devastating loss.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.090
If this heavy rain
continues for two more days,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.550
I fear mud and stones
will slide down the mountain.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.920
I must go to properly
manage the situation.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.680
We need to recruit
more workers below the mountain

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.960
to repair the river embankments.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.560
How can it be done without me?

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.590
Doesn't Linji

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.120
have heavy rain every year?

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.270
The tea plantation has
survived in the past years.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.200
What? Without you for just one day,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.670
will the plantation
face a great disaster?

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.430
Shanbao,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.990
everyone knows you're
in charge of the tea plantation.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.850
Even if you don't go for a few days,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:39.790
who could possibly take away

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:40.790
your authority?

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.070
How improper.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.830
If you dare speak nonsense again,

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.160
you'll be kneeling in the ancestral hall.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.000
We need to reinforce the embankments,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.750
clear the flooded tea fields,

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.720
and take care of
the tea plantation on the mountain.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.030
Major tea merchants from all over

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.960
are also arriving in Linji
one after another,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.160
all waiting for the autumn tea harvest.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.170
No matter how capable Shanbao is,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.130
even with three heads and six arms,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.420
she couldn't manage it all without rest.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.350
Yunyin was worried seeing this,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.110
and spoke harshly
in the heat of the moment.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.240
Shanbao wouldn't take offense at all.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.000
Yunyin just wants to help you.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.790
That's an exaggeration.

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.590
If she's not
at the newly opened plantation

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.520
on the mountain,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.550
the workers below
will neglect their duties

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.960
and delay important matters.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:32.830
Although you

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.830
all manage teahouses and estates,

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.830
and your skills
in management and accounting

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.690
are quite good,

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.160
your expertise in tea processing

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.160
is insufficient.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.920
After flooding,
tea plants easily become diseased.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.850
Which one of you could replace her?

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.750
That breathing doesn't sound right.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.210
Quick, feel her forehead.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.160
It's burning hot.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.640
Lady Shanbao has a fever
and you didn't even know.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.880
Has a doctor checked on her?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.820
Lady Shanbao insisted on coming to report.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.830
I couldn't stop her.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.750
A chill invading the body
can be minor or severe.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:19.830
Those who are usually healthy

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.680
often get hit the hardest
when they fall ill.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.410
Rest at home for two days first.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.460
As for the tea plantation,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.750
leave it for now to Yunxi

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.950
and Yunyin to manage.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.760
I blame my body for being so weak.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.260
Sisters, I have to trouble you

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:41.580
to share my burdens.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:56.720
Water.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.300
Water.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:07.330
Come.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.640
Has the rain stopped?

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.960
The wind and thunder have ceased.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.360
The rain has stopped too.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.240
Now you don't have to worry
about your tea trees

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.700
being washed away, do you?

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.200
Take it easy.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.270
Even if you weren't pretending to be ill,

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.240
you wouldn't be getting up
tomorrow anyway.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.740
The doctor has already said,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.640
you've taken three doses of medicine

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.900
but still can't sweat.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.660
The cold has penetrated from outside

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.590
into your lungs.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.150
You'll really have to go up the mountain.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.910
To lie in the rear mountain cemetery.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.360
You know,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.690
you'd better recover quickly.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.210
Otherwise I'll take an axe

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.710
and chop down your Tea King Tree myself.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.710
You wouldn't dare.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.850
But...

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.010
I can't stop worrying.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:25.010
When I was young, my cousins bullied me
for not having a mother.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.150
I beat them until
they cried for their parents.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.230
Later my father died too,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.400
and my uncles and elder cousins

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.060
came to fight over the estate.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.800
I sold and gave away my meager fields.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:37.790
They thought

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.650
they had gained a huge advantage.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.240
When I passed the imperial exam
and became an official,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.550
these opportunists

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.620
were scared out of their wits.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.200
They offered back
the fields and properties

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.400
and were willing to be servants
just to seek forgiveness.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.110
You see them as closest sisters,

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.600
so to you they are family.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.410
If you disregard that kinship,

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.830
those people are worthless.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.980
The Rong family wasn't like this before.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.400
Sisters and brothers
were raised together from childhood,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.880
with no distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate,

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.940
and no separation between branches.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.730
Men and women knew their roles,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.200
and the women would

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.200
take care of the children together.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.110
The children could hardly
tell birth mother from aunt—

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.270
after all, they all called them Mother.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.870
It doesn't matter
who's the biological child.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.610
When the younger generation grew up,

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.480
they would elect
the smartest one to take charge.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.610
Sisters would support each other

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.970
through thick and thin.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.990
I don't know when it started,

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.040
but everything suddenly changed.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.400
The men in the family
gradually adopted outside customs,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.110
desiring imperial exams,
taking concubines.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.720
The family developed distinctions between
legitimate and illegitimate lines.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.850
Everyone wanted their own household.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.200
For wealth and favor,

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.720
they valued profit over righteousness and
put self-interest above the common good.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.580
The family spirit was corrupted.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.950
What strange custom is this?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.840
I've never heard of such a thing.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.190
And what happened later?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.880
Be quick about your work.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.510
The rain has stopped,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.980
but this work can't stop.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.830
Why are you dawdling? Hurry up.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.920
Can't you see the tea trees

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.830
have all been washed askew
by the heavy rain?

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.070
If the roots are damaged,

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:10.520
they won't recover next year.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.510
Hurry and get people
to straighten them and add soil.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.910
Lady Shanbao instructed

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.000
to gather hands first to clear the ditches

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.740
and drain all the standing water
from the plantation.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.600
Too much water will rot the roots.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.610
Don't use her name to pressure me.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.980
Now I'm in charge of this plantation.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.040
All the tasks I've assigned,

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.920
I will personally inspect tomorrow.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.240
If there is even one thing

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.200
that doesn't meet my expectations,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.240
it will be your fault

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.900
for being lazy and deceitful.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.270
Then you won't need to manage
the plantation anymore.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.000
Just pack your things and leave.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.730
Lady Yunyin,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.400
I'm not trying to shirk my duties.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.750
I truly can't manage it all.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.550
Workers have been sent downhill
to build embankments.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.270
The plantation needs
both dredging and replanting.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.600
We don't have enough people at the moment.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.300
Don't think you can fool me
because I'm young.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.790
This area hasn't suffered from
floods or droughts for a century.

00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.640
The tea plantation has always
enjoyed favorable weather.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.960
My family just donated money
three months ago

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.830
to help the government
raise the embankments.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.590
Now the heavy rain just stopped—

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:04.650
what embankments
are you fixing now?

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.680
Someone must be seeking glory

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.720
and embezzling money,

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.790
making up excuses

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.880
and deliberately fabricating lies!

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.310
Bring me the ledger
for the embankment repairs.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.710
I will inspect it myself.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.270
And call back the people

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:18.960
who are working on the embankments.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960
First straighten
and fertilize the tea trees.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.000
Then check for
plant diseases after the rain.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.110
Anyone who dares to be negligent or whine

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.170
will receive lashes of the iron whip!

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.400
All of you, stop for now.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.660
Do as Lady Yunyin says.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.750
I'll go down the mountain to get help.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:34.510
Shouldn't we wait
for the soil to dry a bit?

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.310
Exactly.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.440
The water isn't fully drained,
and the soil is too wet.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:37.830
If we mound it now,

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.690
it could suffocate the tea roots.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.110
The new boss is riding us hard.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.330
Feels like we're walking on coals.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.610
I've checked all over the plantation.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.590
Dozens of tea trees

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.050
were knocked in this area.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.710
Other areas are fine though.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.680
With some repairs and tidying up,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.590
the autumn tea harvest should be safe.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.440
I'm going to meet the tea merchant soon.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.770
You stay
and keep an eye on the plantation.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.550
Alright.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.760
Why get angry at a mere servant?

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.440
Aren't they deliberately
trying to provoke me?

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.440
Bringing back such a bunch

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.840
of unruly troublemakers

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.530
who oppose me at every turn.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.720
They're clearly building up
someone else's authority.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.550
Someone, for the sake of

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.000
gaining a reputation
for respecting talent,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.440
has allowed these lowly servants
to forget their place.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.110
If the servants don't listen to you,

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.960
just drive them down the mountain.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.720
It's not worth getting upset over.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.720
You'd only cheapen your own status.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.830
Focus on doing your work now,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.030
so that Grandmother can see

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.310
that among the ten fingers,

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.830
the one that seemed long
isn't necessarily the longest,

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:43.290
and the one that seemed short
isn't necessarily the shortest.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.070
Only when she falls will you
have the chance to stand out.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.470
Let her stare helplessly
and stew in anger.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.750
How difficult can tending tea trees be?

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.270
I grew up in the Rong family,

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.880
listening to Grandmother's
teachings every day

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.940
until my ears were calloused from it.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.930
Just because Rong Shanbao can do it

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.690
doesn't mean others can't.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.170
Don't worry.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.030
The tea plantation will be

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.760
put in order within seven days.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.680
It absolutely won't delay

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.010
the autumn tea harvest.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.830
I've traveled from afar

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:16.760
to come to Linji.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.440
Unfortunately, I knew no one

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:19.920
and had no connections.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.880
I couldn't even meet

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.940
Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.480
Lady Yunxi, thanks to
your kind arrangement,

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.340
this large deal can be concluded.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.690
I'm truly grateful beyond words.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.000
This humble gift
is but a small token of respect.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.830
I hope you will present it to Lady Rong

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.880
to express my sincerity.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.560
Master He, your generosity

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.320
is too much for me to accept.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.170
For the first autumn white dew tea,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.660
the He family
arrived in Linji a month early.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.570
With such sincerity and earnestness,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.960
how could I not fulfill your wishes?

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.070
I'll report to Grandmother upon my return,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.350
and good news will come within days.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.690
Please go back and wait at ease.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.830
Alright.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.500
Lady Yunxi, please have some tea.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:30.830
My Lady,

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.750
I heard that the He family

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.150
started as river pirates

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.510
and only later went into the tea business.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.720
Lady Shanbao thinks
they're not presentable

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.720
and won't let them through the door.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.830
How pedantic.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.790
One can't stick rigidly to rules
in business.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.390
Whether merchant or pirate,

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.480
they're bringing real money,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.180
and there are guarantors.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.030
We just sell tea

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:53.130
and ask no more.

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.200
Yes.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.440
Let's go take a look at Lotus Lane.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.880
Take a look.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.790
Sweet and delicious pastries.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:24.750
Be good, Li.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.200
Here.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.480
Here's your tea.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.110
Thank you.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:31.480
Excuse me,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.440
we'd like some tea here.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.270
Little bird.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.150
Your tea.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.230
Bitter,

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.520
and a bit astringent.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.650
Bi.. Bitter?

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.490
I specially improved it.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.389
The first brew does
have some mixed flavors,

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.500
but with the second brew,

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.360
you'll taste the roasted rice aroma.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.159
Wait a moment.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.510
I specially saved some magnolia tofu

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.370
in the ice bucket in the back yard.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.620
Wait for me.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.860
I'll be right back.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.020
Be good, Li.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.550
Play with her for a while.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.360
You can only eat it in small bites.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.230
If you behave,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.880
I will give you this.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:39.800
Okay?

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.400
In a few days,

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.320
I'll buy you again

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.730
these delicious candied hawthorns.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.250
Okay?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.929
Li'er is so good.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:22.190
My Lady, they've left.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.160
Let's go back.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.510
She's one with sky-high standards,

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.000
picking over the gentlemen's

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
looks and wealth,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:39.630
and none meets her approval.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.560
Who would have thought she'd fancy

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.940
someone from a lowly household,

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.390
untalented in both civil and martial arts,

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.190
and a widower with a child?

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.280
A man who brings misfortune
to his mother and wife.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.060
He'll never be accepted
into the Rong family.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.290
No wonder they need to be secretive

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.420
and meet in private.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.360
The fever has lasted for two days now,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.000
and you've been coughing at night.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.730
We should find another doctor.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.690
It's nothing serious.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.480
Lady Shanbao should take her medicine now.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.400
Tell her I said
she must take the medicine.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.460
No matter how important,
it can wait.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.390
Other matters can be left to them,

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.450
but reinforcing the banks

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:35.580
must not be delayed.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.690
If those two refuse to listen,

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.430
report to Grandmother for me.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.590
Then ask Ms. Yan to supervise in person.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.850
That's the most urgent matter right now.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.600
I understand. Don't worry.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:23.860
Young Master, what are you looking at?

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.130
At the rain clouds.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.280
This area often has thunderclouds,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.150
coming in waves.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.070
A gust of wind and they're gone.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.960
The raindrops on your face

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.290
haven't even dried yet.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.560
When I was tuning just now,
the strings were loose.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.250
The soundboard was very damp.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320
I couldn't tune it properly
despite several attempts.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.000
There will definitely
be heavy rain within two days.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.510
Look at the southern horizon.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.840
The dark clouds have a faint reddish tint.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:44.800
I'm afraid

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.840
this rain will be most unusual.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:49.440
What?

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.770
Mr. Lu can also read weather signs?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.050
Lady Yunshu,

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:01.870
I'm not an expert in this field.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.400
Just making casual observations.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.670
I often hear elders say

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.590
that when hail clouds appear,

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.880
they always have high tops
and low bottoms,

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.510
growing like rolling snowballs,

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.960
heavily tilting downward.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.510
Daisy,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.850
are today's clouds like that?

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.030
My Lady, those clouds are quite far away.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.120
They seem to be moving eastward.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:23.730
Then it's not that.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.880
Mr. Lu,

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:28.280
Lady Shanbao hasn't
recovered from the cold yet.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.360
If all those complicated, trivial matters

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.440
are reported to her

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.360
and exhaust her spirit,

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.790
even if she takes medicine,

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:34.720
it won't help.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.690
Please take extra care, Mr. Lu.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.150
It's best to limit visitors these days

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:42.360
and let her rest peacefully.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.570
My Lady, it's starting to rain again.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.960
I love this gentle drizzle.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.410
It's so refreshing.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.190
Young Master, I'm too foolish

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.890
to understand Lady Yunshu's true meaning.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:05.290
Young Master, is she...

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.740
Mind your own business.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.110
Since we've taken on this responsibility,

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.170
none of us would dare not give our all.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.960
It's just that our experience is limited.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.360
Lady Shanbao
has worked hard for many years,

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.950
and her reputation in the tea business
has been growing.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:33.350
She has always been a respected authority.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.680
Some people inevitably abuse their power,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.930
always boasting about
the Rong's tea talent,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.330
refusing to take orders

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.320
from anyone but her.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.690
Who's an outsider?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.960
You were sent

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.890
by me to manage the tea plantation.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.450
Who dares to be so insolent?

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.020
Pass down my words:

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.760
whoever refuses to obey,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.400
no matter how great their skill,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.130
cannot stay in the Rong family.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:56.920
Yes.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.900
With your words, Grandmother,

00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.960
I can rest assured.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.960
From now on, I'll keep a whip handy.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.690
Anyone who doesn't obey

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.810
will behave after a good whipping.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.150
To be honest,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.630
Shanbao has been

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.630
far too lenient.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.480
Every tea farmer should know their place,

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.710
yet the ones she recruited
are all troublemakers.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.310
They rely on their tea skills

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.750
to do the opposite of what they're told,

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.800
refusing to be led,
backing away when pushed,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.670
even daring to talk back to their masters.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.630
I won't tolerate such stubborn behavior.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.670
Even so,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.670
they are all

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.880
experienced masters in our tea plantation.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.920
They have real skill in growing tea.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.760
You must act with propriety.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.720
Grandmother, don't worry.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.410
Yunyin may seem impulsive,

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.640
but she handles matters reliably.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.590
She knows exactly who to keep, who to use,

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.960
and who needs discipline,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.510
with perfect clarity.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.270
Yunshu, you're here.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.420
How is Lady Shanbao doing?

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.870
I went to Hualin Courtyard at noon,

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.400
and she kept asking me
all sorts of questions,

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.030
concerned only about the plantation.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.510
I advised her

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.770
to mind her own health,

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.630
but she simply wouldn't listen.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.230
She's better during the day,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.710
but fever certainly returns after dusk.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.590
The doctor said

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.620
she needs bed rest for a month,

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.850
otherwise the illness will linger

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.840
and become increasingly difficult to cure.

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.110
At this critical moment,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.920
she can't be relied upon at all.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.590
Regarding matters in the tea plantation,

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.190
you must pay more attention.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.840
The autumn tea harvest cannot be delayed.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.370
Don't worry, Grandmother.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.110
As soon as the rain stopped,

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:36.110
I ordered people

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.590
to quickly clean up the plantation.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.320
Yunxi has also been

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.450
busy running around

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.590
and entertaining

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.980
tea merchants from all over in town.

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.000
We work in perfect harmony inside and out,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.200
and won't delay any important matters.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.670
Invite Lady Yunyin to come.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.310
Just say I have urgent business.

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:07.830
Yes.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:08.810
Wait.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.510
Tea farmers are often

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.190
free-spirited mountain folk,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:14.230
and tea cultivation masters

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.560
are even more prideful.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.280
Finding fault with her

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.400
is as easy as pie.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.840
Within two weeks,

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:20.880
they'll be begging at your door.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.590
Then we'll be halfway there.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.550
I know.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.760
But the thunder outside is too fierce.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.550
I'm worried.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.630
I call her to give some instructions.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.160
It won't hinder your plans.

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.010
Go quickly.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:31.550
Yes.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.150
Say what you need to say,
but don't get upset and harm yourself.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.360
Otherwise, your illness

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.620
will never get better.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.990
You may seem decisive,

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.410
but you're actually weak inside,

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.920
nowhere near your fifth sister,

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:06.230
who is cold-hearted and ruthless.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.330
You mean... Yunshu?

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:22.960
She can't wait for your fourth sister

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.560
to cause a terrible disaster

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.880
and fall into a bottomless abyss.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.460
[Mugwort]

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:05.550
The realgar wine shouldn't
be drunk in excess either.

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.600
[Realgar wine is toxic. Do not imitate.]

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.300
Drinking too much makes me dizzy.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.320
Let the sisters go play.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:13.140
Come,

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.030
accompany me for a walk in the garden.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.800
Mugwort is an essential element

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.660
in Dragon Boat Festival customs.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.560
Its main functions are

00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.630
warding off evil and preventing disease,

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.280
as well as praying for good health.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.360
The ancients discovered

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.110
mugwort's versatility long ago.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.030
Its strong smell repels insects;

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.280
it relieves itching used in baths;

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.880
its smoke fumigates for disinfection;

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.230
and pounded, it makes moxa wool.

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.630
It's the ancient version
of a miracle herb.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.250
Around Dragon Boat Festival,
there's a lot of rain,

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:49.000
easily breeding mosquitoes and insects.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Hang it in your home,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.990
and mosquitoes and insects
dare not come near.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.510
Don't think it's just a custom.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.920
This is pest control technology

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.840
proven effective over thousands of years.
