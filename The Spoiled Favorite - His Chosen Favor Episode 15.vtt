WEBVTT

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:24.128
=His Chosen Favor=

00:00:24.128 --> 00:00:27.104
(The tyrant invites me to cuckold him)

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:27.845
=Episode 15=

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:28.765
Your Highness.

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:30.365
Yindan.

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:32.685
Yindan,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:33.925
what brings you here?

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:36.245
I brought some food for you

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.285
and to see if you get better.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:40.325
Yindan,

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:42.445
you're so kind.

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:45.325
Your fever's gone.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:53.325
Eat slowly. Don't choke.

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:54.405
Thank goodness you came.

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:56.805
They gave me no food.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.245
If you hadn't come,

00:00:58.245 --> 00:00:59.485
I'd have gone hungry again.

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:02.085
His Majesty's so heartless.

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:05.485
I'm fine.

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:06.765
What did Xiao Wenjing do to you?

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:08.765
Did he bully you?

00:01:08.765 --> 00:01:09.725
I'm alright.

00:01:09.725 --> 00:01:11.365
I'm still serving in the Zhaohua Palace.

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:12.805
Good to hear that.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:14.205
Yindan,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.445
have you considered

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:18.965
leaving the palace with me?

00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:21.685
Leave the palace?

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:24.365
Prince Rui said

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:26.005
he has a way to get me out.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.205
Will you come with me?

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.965
We can leave this wretched place.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:30.685
When?

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:34.965
Prince Rui didn't say when.

00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.005
He just told me to wait.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:38.525
I want to think it over.

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:40.005
Of course.

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:41.405
Think it through.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:43.445
Don't worry.

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.125
After we get out,

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:47.285
I'll open a clinic.

00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:49.440
My job's diagnosis,
and yours is payment.

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:51.405
We'll make a good living.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:52.965
And we absolutely

00:01:52.965 --> 00:01:54.085
won't go hungry.

00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:58.005
Then...

00:01:58.005 --> 00:01:59.645
Do you no longer love His Majesty?

00:02:02.245 --> 00:02:02.965
No.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:05.405
He's not worthy of my love.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:06.325
Yes,

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:08.165
he's not worthy.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:09.405
You know today His Majesty...

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:11.765
What did he do?

00:02:12.645 --> 00:02:14.965
Please tell me.

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.005
He's treated me badly.

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:17.645
Why shield him anymore?

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:20.485
Today, I went to His Majesty

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.565
to tell him you were ill.

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:24.965
But he spent the day in the Zichen Hall

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:26.085
with Noble Consort Qing.

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:28.725
Eunuch Fu just mentioned
the Laundry Service,

00:02:29.205 --> 00:02:30.925
when he dismissed him.

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:33.365
You're right.

00:02:34.045 --> 00:02:35.445
He's not worth your love.

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:40.965
Yes.

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:47.085
He's not worth loving.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:09.485
This horse carving is adorable.

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.085
It's a deer.

00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:13.845
An adorable deer.

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.485
I mistook it for a horse.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.285
Has Lu Zhen'er

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.085
caused any trouble?

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:23.605
No news

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:25.845
of Ms. Lu.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.725
Nothing at all?

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.685
What does she do all day then?

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:36.125
Seems to do the laundry.

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:37.885
Seems?

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:41.725
You didn't send men to watch her?

00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:44.125
Your Majesty didn't order that.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:47.925
Without

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:49.885
my order, you won't do anything.

00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:50.925
Should I order everything?

00:03:50.925 --> 00:03:52.245
What's the point of you?

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:53.925
I neglected my duty.

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:56.445
I'll send someone to watch her now.

00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.925
And have someone tell her

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.645
I'm waiting for her to beg for mercy.

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:00.885
Understood.

00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:02.045
Forget it.

00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:04.685
I'll go myself

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.085
to see how miserable she is.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:08.525
Let's go.

00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:18.725
Wash these.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.405
Stop!

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:20.485
What do you want?

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.845
These were assigned to you.

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:24.325
Why are you dumping them on me?

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:26.125
Noble Consort Qing has decreed

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.925
you'll do all her palace laundry.

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:30.765
I refuse.

00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:33.445
You think you can refuse?

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:35.125
Still playing the consort, huh?

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.125
Lu Zhen'er, nowadays,

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.405
Noble Consort Qing

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.565
is the most favored consort.

00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.445
Yesterday His Majesty bestowed upon her

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.125
a lot of gold, silver, and jewels.

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.725
To oppose Her Highness?

00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:47.125
Are you qualified?

00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:50.405
You've only been favored for a few days.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:51.845
Don't think you're special!

00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:57.925
What are you doing?

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:00.645
My apologies.

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:03.285
I used too much force.

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.685
This is Her Highness' ceremonial robe!

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:08.685
She won't let you get away with this!

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:10.965
Go ahead and tell her!

00:05:11.325 --> 00:05:12.765
Lu Zhen'er! How dare you!

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.045
Am I being too lenient?

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:18.485
I'll report this to Her Highness.

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.565
Go ahead!

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:21.365
If you don't, you're spineless!

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:24.525
Push your luck again,

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:26.685
and I'll beat you up when I see you!

00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:31.245
Such a madwoman.

00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:35.445
Seems you're having a great time here.

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:37.765
What are you here for?

00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:38.765
To mock me?

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:47.125
If you beg for mercy now,

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.045
I'll restore you as Consort Lu.

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:50.365
No need.

00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:52.605
Is it that hard to apologize?

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.445
You know what you look like now?

00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:57.925
You're exactly like a schoolboy

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:00.565
who bullies girls to get attention!

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:01.845
Nonsense!

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:03.885
You know whether it's nonsense or not.

00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:04.845
I just want to tell you

00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:06.005
I despise such a man.

00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:08.325
Utterly childish.

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.405
I have a temper too!

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.885
(Xiao Wenjing,)

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:36.205
(I might like you a little,)

00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:37.965
(but you're unworthy of my love.)

00:06:40.805 --> 00:06:42.805
Speak if you have business.

00:06:42.805 --> 00:06:45.125
Leave if you don't.

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.285
Your Majesty, I have urgent matters
to report.

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:51.925
Prince Rui, what is it?

00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:55.685
Five years ago,
I earned merit defending the frontier.

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:59.205
The late emperor awarded me
a blank imperial decree.

00:06:59.205 --> 00:07:01.485
Today, I came with it

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:03.125
to make a request.

00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:05.285
What do you want?

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:14.845
Your Majesty, please grant me marriage
to Lu Zhen'er.

00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:22.005
He is outrageously bold!

00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:22.525
Indeed!

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:24.045
This will throw the court into chaos!

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:26.205
What blank imperial decree?

00:07:26.205 --> 00:07:27.205
I've never heard of it.

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.285
Fu An, bring it to me.

00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:41.600
(Blank Imperial Decree)

00:07:45.325 --> 00:07:47.365
Such imperial favors are rare.

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:50.085
You should reconsider carefully.

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:52.205
I want nothing else,

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.645
just Lu Zhen'er.

00:07:53.645 --> 00:07:55.565
Please grant this marriage.

00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:56.845
Lu Zhen'er is my consort!

00:07:56.845 --> 00:07:58.685
She is merely a laundry maid!

00:07:59.765 --> 00:08:00.765
We'll discuss this later.

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:01.845
Your Majesty,

00:08:01.845 --> 00:08:04.765
the blank decree was granted
by the late emperor.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:08.045
Are you going to defy
the late emperor's order?

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.325
Marriage is a grave matter
for any woman.

00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:17.565
I refuse to pressure her
with imperial power.

00:08:18.405 --> 00:08:20.365
Your Majesty could summon Ms. Lu.

00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:22.365
If she refuses to marry me,

00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:25.245
I'll respect her decision!

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.485
Fu An, fetch Lu Zhen'er.

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:31.965
Yes!

00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:52.765
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:55.085
Long live Your Majesty.

00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:55.765
Rise.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:56.925
Thank you.

00:08:57.845 --> 00:08:59.245
Zhen'er, today

00:08:59.245 --> 00:09:01.845
with the blank decree granted
by the late emperor,

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:04.365
I petition His Majesty for our marriage.

00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:06.645
Would you marry me

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.085
and become my wife?

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:09.525
Lu Zhen'er,

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:11.165
think carefully!

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:12.165
This is Prince Rui!

00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:13.485
His scandal recently

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:14.605
set the whole city abuzz!

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.445
All misunderstandings!

00:09:17.805 --> 00:09:18.885
There are witnesses!

00:09:19.045 --> 00:09:20.325
It's fabricated!

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:20.885
You...

00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:21.725
I trust His Highness.

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:24.845
Lu Zhen'er!

00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:26.445
Your Majesty,

00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:28.645
I'm willing to marry Prince Rui.

00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:30.765
Please grant this marriage.

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:41.565
Please grant this marriage.

00:09:42.485 --> 00:09:44.805
We'll discuss this later.

00:09:44.805 --> 00:09:47.885
Your Majesty, I have a decree granted
by the late emperor.

00:09:47.885 --> 00:09:49.885
This is a place
for handling state affairs,

00:09:49.885 --> 00:09:51.605
not for personal romantic matters.

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:52.845
Dismissed!

00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:54.765
I'll take Lu Zhen'er as my wife.

00:10:07.885 --> 00:10:09.085
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:18.685
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

00:10:18.765 --> 00:10:20.125
You tried to kill me once.

00:10:22.085 --> 00:10:23.125
What do you mean?

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:24.245
What do I mean?

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:25.965
I don't understand.

00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:29.125
Do you wish to marry Prince Rui?

00:10:29.605 --> 00:10:30.485
Why shouldn't I?

00:10:30.925 --> 00:10:32.165
Lu Zhen'er,

00:10:32.165 --> 00:10:33.645
as a modern person,

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:34.845
will you love an ancient man?

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:36.165
Why wouldn't I?

00:10:36.685 --> 00:10:38.485
Prince Rui isn't as good as you imagine.

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:40.605
Can't you see he has ulterior motives?

00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:42.125
Whether ulterior motives

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.165
or other hidden agendas,

00:10:43.805 --> 00:10:45.245
as long as the outcome benefits me,

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:47.165
the process won't matter.

00:10:47.445 --> 00:10:48.965
You won't benefit forever.

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:50.725
Before figuring out what he wants,

00:10:50.725 --> 00:10:51.605
you want to marry him.

00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:53.165
Utterly foolish!

00:10:53.165 --> 00:10:53.965
Xiao Wenjing,

00:10:54.565 --> 00:10:56.085
between people,

00:10:56.085 --> 00:10:57.405
it's all about mutual benefit.

00:10:57.405 --> 00:10:59.765
If he treats me well out of love,

00:10:59.765 --> 00:11:01.445
I won't dare even glance his way.

00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:02.805
Just because he seeks benefits,

00:11:02.805 --> 00:11:04.445
I find him worthy of my trust.

00:11:04.445 --> 00:11:05.525
Because I can ensure,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:07.008
he'll always want something from me.

00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:13.405
True love is fleeting,

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:15.045
just like fireworks.

00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:17.405
Only mutual benefit

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:19.085
can endure.

00:11:19.245 --> 00:11:20.765
Lu Zhen'er, have you gone mad?

00:11:20.965 --> 00:11:21.645
I'm not mad.

00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:23.085
I've been like this.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.005
Yes, you've been like this.

00:11:27.485 --> 00:11:28.645
Lu Zhen'er,

00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:29.445
I forgot

00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:31.005
you crave power, chase benefits

00:11:31.005 --> 00:11:32.805
and stop at nothing
to achieve your goals.

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:34.965
You're an out-and-out schemer.

00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:36.725
I'll take that as a compliment.

00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:39.845
If that's all,

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:41.405
I'll take my leave.

00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:44.285
Once we set a wedding date,

00:11:44.285 --> 00:11:45.565
Your Majesty,

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:46.885
please join our wedding banquet.

00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:50.805
Your Majesty, Prince Rui requests
an audience.

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:52.605
Your Majesty,

00:11:53.285 --> 00:11:55.165
please grant the marriage.

00:11:56.885 --> 00:11:57.725
I'll take my leave.

Put me down!

00:12:10.725 --> 00:12:11.965
Put me down!

Your Majesty,

00:12:14.845 --> 00:12:16.885
I sincerely love Lu Zhen'er.

00:12:16.885 --> 00:12:18.165
Please grant us your blessing.

00:12:19.445 --> 00:12:21.005
I wish to take her as my wife.

00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:21.605
Let go of me!

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:24.765
From then on, we'll live in harmony,
companions for life.

(We actually kissed!)

00:12:41.205 --> 00:12:43.685
Your Majesty, please grant the marriage.
