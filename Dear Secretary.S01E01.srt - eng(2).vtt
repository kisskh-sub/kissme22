00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.920
Where did this handsome guy come from?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.359
You don't know him?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.759
Lin Han.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.359
An overseas returnee financial talent.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.039
Fluent in five languages.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.640
188 centimeters tall.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.479
His body fat percentage stays around 15%.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.960
And,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.600
piano, equestrian, tennis...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.520
He's good at everything.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.759
And has won international awards for each.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.200
So outstanding.

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:02.840
Which family's son is he?

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.359
He's the Chief Executive Officer of Qin Group,

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:06.079
which has been emerging in the national home furnishing market

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.640
over the past two years.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.640
President Qin Meili's secretary.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:11.760
Secretary?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.959
Long time no see, President Wang.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:15.439
Yes.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.000
President Wang.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.120
That's true.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.239
It's just that the return rate isn't very high.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.799
Yes.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.400
It's nothing.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.920
How about we collaborate on more projects in the future?

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.439
Cheers.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.000
Miss Qin.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.680
What are your thoughts on Qin's furniture

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.400
in the future Korean market?

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:32.760
Long time no see.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.239
Hey.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.359
It has been quite a while.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.200
It has great potential.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.640
After all, our two cultures share common ground.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.719
Looking forward to a smooth cooperation.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.439
Pleasure doing business.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.239
It's nothing.

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:50.519
Let's collaborate more

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:51.680
on projects in the future.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.959
Cheers.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.120
Why are you late, Secretary Lin?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.120
As you instructed,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.120
handling Manager Zhang's matter took some time.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.239
My sincere apologies.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.640
When did you learn Korean?

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:02.959
When you decided to expand into

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.519
the Korean overseas market.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.319
A month ago.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.920
Not bad.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.800
You're starting to resemble me more and more.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.840
I strive to keep up with your pace.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.879
That's my job.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.719
Are you sure he's just a secretary?

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.759
Of course.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.960
And because his own abilities are outstanding,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.759
many companies want to poach him.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.400
But he's turned them all down.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.520
What a pity.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.520
I was thinking of dating him.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.680
Don't even think about it.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.000
A catch like him

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.599
has probably already been pocketed by Miss Qin.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.719
Let's go.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:39.199
The ball is about to start.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.919
My dear secretary.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.639
Secretary Lin.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:32.439
How do I look today?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.759
Absolutely stunning.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.960
Let's go.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.879
Is everyone here?

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:39.960
As you instructed,

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.319
they are already in the conference room.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.319
President Qin.

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.360
I hope the phone didn't hurt your foot.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.319
I promise it won't happen again.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.800
Secretary Lin.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.600
Handle this.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.879
Manager Zhang from Sales, right?

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:39.639
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.439
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.319
A new phone

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.879
will be delivered to your workstation this afternoon.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.839
What about the data on my phone?

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.519
The repair costs will be covered by the company.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.279
Don't worry.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.480
I'll send someone to the elevator shaft later

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.839
to retrieve your phone for you.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.720
Until then,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.079
please focus on your work.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.160
Secretary Lin.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.439
Our President Qin is really considerate of her subordinates.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.279
Of course she is.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.120
You'd better go now.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.399
Hello, Captain Liu.

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.120
The surveillance footage from elevator number three,

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.639
from 1:45 to 1:50 just now.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.319
Could you please download it and send it to my email?

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.120
Thank you.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:36.720
Hello, hello.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.839
This is Qin Group.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.279
A male colleague at our company

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:41.240
took photos up a female colleague's skirt in the elevator.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.639
It was caught on surveillance.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.800
The screen of the phone used for the photos is cracked,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.920
but it should still be repairable.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.040
Hello, HR department?

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.000
This is Secretary Lin.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.160
I need the sales department's

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.319
Zhang Weisuo's personnel file.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.240
Also, please dismiss him as soon as possible.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.360
The specific reasons

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.680
will be explained in an email from me.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.920
Understood, Secretary Lin.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.879
My flight is at 12:30 tonight.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.879
If you're busy,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:10.959
you don't need to pick me up.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.959
Don't worry.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.279
I will definitely be there on time.

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:19.879
The overseas market carries high risk.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.800
Currently, the company's asset portfolio

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800
is already quite complex.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.079
Entering it rashly now

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.480
could further increase the risk.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.399
How do we handle exchange rate fluctuations?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.800
Let me address the second question first.

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:30.920
We can use

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.600
forward foreign exchange contracts to lock in rates.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.279
Additionally, we can include

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.639
exchange rate adjustment clauses in contracts.

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.959
I've already asked Secretary Lin to draft the specific plan.

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:39.519
Furthermore, a diversified market strategy

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.639
can reduce some dependency

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.000
on any single market.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.839
As for the risk exposure issue,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.439
Secretary Lin.

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:46.240
Yes.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.639
From the Capital Asset Pricing Model perspective,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:50.399
while the overseas market risk is high,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.240
it also has significant return potential.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.079
We have conducted a beta coefficient analysis.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.319
We will use hedging to offset the risk.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.680
Discounted Cash Flow model analysis also shows

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.560
the IRR and NPV are substantial.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.800
The investment value is clear.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.920
Moving forward,

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.319
besides closely monitoring overseas policy trends,

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.319
we will also start from the WACC

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.360
to optimize assets and liabilities,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.040
arrange financing management properly,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.519
reduce costs, and improve turnover.

00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:21.759
Lin Han.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.639
Graduated from a top university.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.879
Impressive resume.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:25.639
All very good.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.839
To be my secretary,

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.199
knowledge, professionalism,

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.240
and skills are all important.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.079
Multiple languages. (English)

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:37.639
As you require. (French)

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:46.720
This is all the information you need for your job.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.600
Within two days,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.839
you must familiarize yourself with

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:50.040
all the client information inside

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.879
and compile a summary

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:52.600
of all company data and materials.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.199
In a moment, Secretary Gu will brief you on

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:55.680
the company's complete personnel structure.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.959
I can grant you the highest company access.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:07:59.920
So I also hope you

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.160
won't let me down.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.759
President Qin.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.680
I'd like to request an advance

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.120
of one year's salary.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.920
No problem.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.240
You smile a lot.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.480
I smile when I see

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.600
beautiful things.

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.439
We also have a set of risk early-warning

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.839
and hedging tools.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.600
Risks are measurable,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.800
controllable, and manageable.

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.840
A professional team monitors in real-time

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.120
and develops contingency plans.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.799
Indeed, very good.

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:41.200
I trust you all understand

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.559
the critical nature of today's decision.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.120
In conclusion, I believe

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.360
our Qin Group

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.600
will undoubtedly shine

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
in the overseas market.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.399
Mm-hmm, good.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.360
Secretary Lin.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:26.840
You did well today.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.559
It's because the boss guided me well.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.519
And you truly haven't disappointed

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.440
my expectations of you.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:33.799
These three years,

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.399
we've become more and more in sync.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.000
I really can't think of anyone else

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.440
more suitable to be my secretary.
