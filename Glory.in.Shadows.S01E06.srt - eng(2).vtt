00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.320
General,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.760
may I ask why my mother was there?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.480
Who exactly were your men protecting?

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.040
Madam, here's what happened.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.350
Earlier, the Shen family said

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.310
they were taking

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.120
Madam Shen back for your homecoming.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.040
But our men didn't understand

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.230
the twists in this,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.560
and ended up letting them take her away.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.000
The General wasn't involved.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.480
Please, Madam,
don't mistake the General.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.760
It was my oversight in the end.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.640
It's fair if you're upset.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.230
We can bring your mother to Li Manor,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.230
so you can care for her.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.710
I…

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.320
Forget it.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.560
Li Manor is too complicated.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.870
I wouldn't feel at ease this way.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.920
But still, I must thank the General today.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.080
If you hadn't arrived in time,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.800
I might have perished
at Lady Siyun's hands.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.520
We are husband and wife.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.030
I couldn't possibly do nothing.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.280
You went after reading that letter?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.640
Letter?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080
What letter?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.150
You didn't read it?

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.240
Then why did you go?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.030
Xu Shan told me your
mother was taken away.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.150
I was concerned.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.200
So I hurried back.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.030
It's getting late.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.800
Let's head back first.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.360
Your mother needs rest, too.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.270
Alright.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.870
Yaochu...

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.920
Yaochu...

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.310
Madam!

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.430
You've returned.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.400
Where's that letter?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.960
I waited, but the General
never came back.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.420
I was afraid of delaying,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.080
so I handed the letter

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.560
to Deputy General Xu just now.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.630
I see. You may leave.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.310
Yes.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.870
Who else knows about the attempt on

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.640
my life in the army?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.400
Aside from us few men,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.470
no one else knew.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.240
And it was never leaked.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.590
So how could a woman kept in her chambers

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.240
possibly find out?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.750
What?

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.400
Could Madam be tied to this attempt?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.150
No wonder she thought

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.840
I went to her after reading the letter.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.910
Turns out she was certain

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.710
I'd be curious about its contents.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.200
(Yaochu knew the assassination)
I underestimated her.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.520
Who is it?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.120
General, you've read my letter?

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.080
How did you know I was attacked?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.760
A guess.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.080
A guess?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.840
Yes.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.800
These days, I've been
wondering about one thing.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.120
You spread the news
of your feigned death,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.270
yet secretly returned

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.750
and came to marry me
with your identity hidden.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.720
None of this adds up.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.240
If it were to mislead an enemy,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.190
then you should have
been in another land.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.000
But you came back to the capital.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.230
That means

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.000
the culprit is right in the capital.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240
Others may not realize it,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.600
but since you and I

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.000
have shared a few close moments,

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.390
I've smelled medicine on you.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.040
(Why would he carry the scent of medicine?)

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.430
You're bold.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.160
What if I took you for
an accomplice and killed you?

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.750
Take me for an accomplice?

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.920
You would only interrogate me,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.150
not kill me.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.770
If I died,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.870
you'd lose your only lead.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.270
Knowing too much is rarely a good thing.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.510
For a fool, knowing
too much is no good thing.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.120
But I am no fool.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.400
I can help you.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.880
You?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.440
Help me?

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.230
That's right.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.120
When you returned to the manor,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.950
you must have suspected that

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.800
the killer was someone close by.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.680
And here I am, in the household,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.720
sharing trust with you.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.160
Wouldn't I make the perfect
informant for you?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.870
Informant?

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.200
You've even schemed against me.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.680
How could I dare to trust you?

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.830
You aren't someone to trust, either.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.360
If that's the case,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.360
you won't need to meddle in my affairs.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
You get hurt too easily.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.640
Turn around.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.960
What for?

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.310
Your wound's on your back,
you can't reach it.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.790
Let me help you.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.200
No need.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.270
I'll blindfold myself. I won't see you.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.350
Is that fine for you?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.070
We are husband and wife.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.240
Why should I fear you?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.230
You...

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.070
You're a lady...

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.800
When life is truly at its end,

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.600
who would care so much?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.190
A horsewhip on the body,
how could it not hurt?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.270
I meant the other wounds.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.230
Do they still hurt?

The wounds you took,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.000
do they still ache?

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.190
The scars have healed,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.240
yet the pain cuts to the bone.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.240
But those wounds

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.950
will heal sooner or later,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.590

Shen Yaochu hid the antidote away.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.080

When my looks return,

I'll go plead with him!

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.200
He will surely forgive me.

Mother,

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.240

End her life...

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.840
Mother, I brought you...

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.240
No, it wasn't me.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.570
- Shen Yunxi?
- I didn't kill her.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.270

Jingchuan,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.440
why do you have such spirit to come

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.960
with me to Guanyin Nunnery today?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.200
Nothing pressing, just out for a walk.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.150
Why didn't you invite your wife along?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.840
Maybe she's already here.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.990
Stop right there!

Shen Yunxi, stop there!

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.710
- Yaochu...
- Wan'er!

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.110
Stay where you are!

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.630
Come any closer, and she dies!

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.920
Let Wan'er go first.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.200
What happened here?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.080
Shen Yunxi...

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.960
She took my mother's life.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.790
No, I didn't! It wasn't me!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.270
Jingchuan, please help me!

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.230
Jingchuan!

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.960
What did I do wrong?

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.960
You fall short in every way.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.440
But you were born to the rightful wife,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.510
while I was only from a concubine.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.030
Why can you and your
mother walk over me?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:43.910
Now my mother's ruined because of you.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.110
Shen Yaochu...

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.750
Don't think you'll get away!

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.590
Jingchuan!

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.870
Are you alright?

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.510
I'm fine.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.000
So that's how it is...

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:03.750
What did you say?

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.920
What are you saying?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.840
What do you mean?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.960
Speak up! Why are you laughing?

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.960
I'm laughing at how foolish you are.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.630
What do you mean?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.200
Shen Yunxi,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.200
what do you mean?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.790
You truly think I was the one
who killed your mother?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.200
Then who was it?

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.270
You will never know...

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.870
Shen Yunxi, speak to me.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.160
You must not die.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.960
Say something!

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.130
Get up!

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.150
Talk to me!
