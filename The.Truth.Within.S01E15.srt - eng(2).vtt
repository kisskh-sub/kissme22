00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.860
[Episode 15]

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.780
Lijia Town.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.500
Going where?

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.380
Why'd you arrest me?

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.410
Let go!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.260
Go on, run!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.850
(Maybe a third person.)

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.540
And...

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.660
this person

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.010
is connected to Li Yiqi's death.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.130
Maybe he's the one

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.130
we're looking for.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.340
Here's

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.340
Wang Chen's blood report.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.820
It shows an anesthetic.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.780
Perhaps Wang Chen was unconscious

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.540
before falling into the lake?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.060
Only two guys in the car.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.980
Song Weimin was dead.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.660
Wang Chen was unconscious? How?

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.980
A third person.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.540
(Song Weimin killed Wang Chen)

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.780
(for his daughters.)

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.100
(Then how does the killer)

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.410
(link to Wang Chen?)

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.220
(Li Yiqi)

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.610
(was killed after 1 AM.)

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.140
(Judging from the cars movement,)

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.900
(the killer went to)

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.250
(see Wang Chen later.)

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.300
(Nothing nearby was open.)

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.220
(Where did they meet?)

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.570
Zhang Chunmin.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.220
You've seen

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.100
the other places

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.780
Wang Chen rented.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.730
This is the last one.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.780
It's quite tidy.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.820
Thank you.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.410
Sure thing.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.050
Zhang.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.020
Is that house vacant now?

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.660
A few days ago, two men

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.020
had a nasty argument.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.250
Did they move out?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.290
How about renting it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.220
to my friend

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.250
at a discount?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.410
No problem.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.050
Thanks.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.580
My pleasure.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.340
Excuse me.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.050
You said

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.610
you saw those two men?

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.020
I saw them

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.780
go inside.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.580
That night,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.610
I got up to use the bathroom

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.050
and heard noise outside the door.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.410
What a mess!

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.220
You've gotten me into trouble!

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.490
Take a look.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.980
Is it him?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.730
Uh...

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.730
Not sure.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.930
And this tattoo?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.020
Remember it?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.610
Yes.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.100
It's him.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.610
I remember thinking

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.370
he couldn't be a good guy.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.050
You said

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.540
they were arguing.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.540
Could you

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.050
make out what they said?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.220
I only saw them go in together.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.780
Then...

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.930
after a little while,

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.140
I heard a loud door slam

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.850
and footsteps leaving.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.340
Thanks.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.140
Zhang.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.580
Don't forget

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.490
my house.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.220
Sure.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.290
Hello?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.220
Mr. Qi,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.580
we found something.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.660
Need a match.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.370
Okay.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.410
On my way.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.020
Ms. Zhu.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.100
Are the hair sample results

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.050
for Fan Jiangxue back?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.610
Still processing.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.810
How much longer?

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.020
Soon.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.410
Ms. Zhu,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.700
the hair from Hu Jie's home

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.850
is a match

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.700
for Ruan Mingyu.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.460
Once ready,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.050
call me.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.850
Okay.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.050
Mr. Han,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.490
the match

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.410
is back.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.700
It's Ruan Mingyu's.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.730
The print match

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.730
will take a bit.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.900
Let's begin first.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.460
You and Hu Jie

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.050
had an argue at the restaurant.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.580
She left first,

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.410
then you left.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.250
Surveillance shows

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.140
you left

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.730
at 7:36 PM.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.810
Hu Jie died

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.140
between 9 PM and 11 PM.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.460
We've confirmed

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.250
that her home is the primary scene.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.930
We found

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.900
your hair, fingerprints,
and skin cells there.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.370
We're friends.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.100
I often visited her.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.980
Finding my traces there

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.900
isn't weird.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.100
Besides,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.100
a piece of advice.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.610
Use your brain

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:34.540
when working a case.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.850
How would I kill her?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.580
I sell her paintings.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.410
You didn't kill Hu Jie.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.610
Why did you run?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.340
Though from different angles,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.900
these two are of the same place.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.340
14 years ago, you went to Lijia Town?

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.050
Are you linked

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.020
to Fan Jiangxue's death?

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.220
What really happened to Hu Jie?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:37.940
Mr. Qi,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.490
the results are in.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.370
The prints on the painting

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.730
don't match

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.460
Ruan's.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.180
I see.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.180
Mr. Qi, the results are ready.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.340
You will catch the killer.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.250
Right?

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.820
Tell us

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.530
everything you know.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.300
After parting with
Hu Jie at the restaurant,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.820
I did go to her place.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.130
It was for this painting.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.220
But I truly meant to help her.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.010
That was her last chance.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.650
Jie.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.250
Last night,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.490
the buyer called me again.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.220
It's been over a month.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.850
When will you deliver

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:50.530
the painting?

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.340
I finally get out for a meal.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.700
Can we not talk about

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.820
such a downer?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.820
I don't want to ruin the mood.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.250
But...

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.820
No sales for quite a while.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.340
Now

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.340
someone finally wants your work.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.370
You should know

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.100
you need the money.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.850
If something

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.770
bothers you,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.010
tell me, and I'll sort it out.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.580
I've told you many times.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:19.980
This painting

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.100
is priceless.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.980
Then tell me

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.490
how you plan to repay

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.370
your debts abroad?

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.460
Can we please drop this?

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.610
Jie.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.820
I'm your agent.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.060
We've worked together for years.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.460
You know

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.820
what I care about

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.890
isn't my commission.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.130
Every decision I make

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.060
is for your good.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.130
Can we stop?

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.220
It's really annoying.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:55.940
I know

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.220
this was created years ago.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.940
It's not

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.700
your style now.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.610
You don't wanna sell it.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.940
But now someone finally

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.820
wants your work

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.250
and is offering a high price.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.340
You have to

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.180
face reality.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.890
Understand?

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.460
Are you crazy?

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.890
Let me go!

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.490
At my place,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.460
I told you

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.850
Hu Jie lacked emotional stability.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.530
She really

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.580
made me extremely angry.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.890
But after I cooled down,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.700
I got worried about her.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.980
I called her,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.580
but she didn't answer.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.650
So I went to

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.100
her place

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.580
to see

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.250
if she was fine.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.420
Of course,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.340
I really wanted to know

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.060
what was wrong with the painting.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.850
When did you

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.940
go to Hu Jie's place?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.890
Around 11 PM.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.340
I had alcohol,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.180
so I took a cab.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.650
You can check

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.250
ride history.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.940
How did you get in?

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.420
Hu Jie was abroad then.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.700
I helped her

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.370
buy that apartment.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.220
So I have a spare key.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.730
What did you do inside?

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.770
I entered without asking.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.060
And I didn't want her to know

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.060
I had a spare key.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.580
So...

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.460
I was nervous.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.850
I left lights off.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.010
I wanted to see

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.100
if the painting

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.610
was there.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.530
That's when it hit me.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.890
She had stained the painting

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:53.730
and couldn't hand it over.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.890
She wanted to repaint it

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:56.730
but failed.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.340
So she kept delaying it.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.340
Ruan Mingyu's prints

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.180
don't match the ones

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.420
from the unsigned painting.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.340
And the hair match?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.610
Not from

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.890
the same maternal lineage.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.460
Mr. Han.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.650
I just asked the security

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.340
at Ruan Mingyu's place.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.460
His story checks out.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.770
He came home after nine

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.250
and left after 11.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.890
His ride history supports this.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.370
Hey, Su.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.060
Got it.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.180
Song Weimin's sister

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.220
is here.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.580
I'll go.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.180
Go ahead.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.370
Stop wasting time.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.530
Please believe me.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.060
Hu Jie's death

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.940
has nothing to do with me.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.220
Then tell us

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.460
your relationship with her.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.730
Hu Jie and I

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.250
met at a university

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.650
art competition.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.490
She's pretty

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.730
and talented.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.980
I was deeply drawn to her.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.370
That summer,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.730
I secretly went to
Lijia Town to see her.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.300
What are you shooting?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.250
It's you. See.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.220
Delete it.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.300
Delete it!

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.420
Hurry!

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.700
You... Delete it now!

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:11.490
Alright.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:14.580
I was very curious

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.980
and asked her

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.100
what she threw.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.940
She didn't tell me.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.980
She reacted very intensely

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.890
and insisted

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.220
I delete the photo.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.610
Did you see what she threw?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.180
No.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.010
But people in town said

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.180
someone died in the hills that day.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:37.180
Killed by a pen

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.340
to the neck.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.980
Given Hu Jie's reaction

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.770
to the photo...

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.530
I thought

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.730
it might

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.700
be connected to Hu Jie.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.180
What she threw into the lake

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.300
might be

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.420
that pen.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.100
Why didn't you call the police?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.580
I love her.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.100
She's the one

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.610
I wanna protect.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.770
So many times I've dreamed...

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.130
this secret

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.770
was mine alone.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.250
If I kept

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.220
this secret,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:20.730
would she

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.940
be with me forever?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.890
So you deleted it?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.010
No.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.180
The photo is on my computer.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.460
You can check.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.220
But even so,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.060
Hu Jie didn't want

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.820
to be with me.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.060
Because back then,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.530
she loved someone else.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.770
Do you know him?

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.180
No.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.820
I don't know him.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.060
I only know

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:56.650
she met him

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.770
at a competition

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.420
in Jiang City.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.100
She won the Silver Award.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.220
That guy won the gold.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:08.860
She took the one she liked

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.730
to Lijia Town.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.730
But he

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:12.660
fell in love

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.940
with her friend, Fan Jiangxue.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.050
I knew Hu Jie well.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.050
She couldn't handle it.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.460
So I went to Lijia Town

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.010
to comfort her.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.940
I failed to protect her.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.770
That's why everything happened.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.700
Yes.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.290
It's Weimin.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.940
Sir,

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.220
who killed

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.570
my brother?

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.380
We're still investigating.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.420
He and I

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.980
hadn't seen each other for years.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.810
Last month, I visited him.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.090
He wasn't

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.530
doing well mentally then.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.570
Kind of strange.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.330
Weimin.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.810
Weimin?

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:45.570
Weimin?

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:47.290
Weimin?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:50.860
You...

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.010
What are you looking at?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.660
You're here.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.940
Who are you smiling at?

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.290
What happened next

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.530
was even stranger.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:10.940
Come on.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.810
Qian,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.940
eat it.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:16.980
Weimin,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.050
Qian is gone.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.010
Please live your life well.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.330
Pull yourself together!

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.530
Qian is always by my side.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.810
I tried to talk to him,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.860
but he snapped at me.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.460
We ended up having a big fight.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.570
I never expected

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.220
that would be

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.660
our last meeting.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.140
I thought he became like this

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.770
because of Qian.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.380
But when I

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.980
was packing his things,

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.090
I found his medication.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.620
Can you

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.860
bring them over?

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.010
This is the photo

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.730
Ruan mentioned.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.810
It's been a while.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.180
This is the best resolution.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.250
That's it.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.380
Mr. Han, Ms. Zhu,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.770
I found the info

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.010
on the art competition

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.810
Ruan mentioned.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.810
Portfolio.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.810
Registration.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.570
It hasn't

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.530
been held for years.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.730
Oh,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.810
this is Hu Jie's Silver Award.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.810
Gold Award.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.180
Did you get the file on the guy

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.730
who won gold?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:31.570
Yes.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.460
Right, it's him.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.980
Chen Chuchuan?

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.860
Chen Chuchuan?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.620
He's a friend of Qi Sizhe

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.700
from the university.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.140
He wasn't

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:20.460
doing well mentally then.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.420
Kind of strange.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:38.980
Maggie.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:41.530
Mr. Qi,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.620
why are you here?

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.380
Is Dr. Chen not in?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.530
I haven't

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.620
seen him for days.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.380
He just told me to pack up.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.460
Hello.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.900
Police.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.010
We need your cooperation.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:21.980
Fine.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.730
Is Chen Chuchuan here?

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.050
No.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.770
No?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.940
Last time you saw him?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.620
What are you doing here?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.460
Chen Chuchuan is the prime suspect

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.380
in Hu Jie's case.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.010
He's also linked

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:09.250
to Fan Jiangxue's case.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.460
Why look for him?

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.220
Among Song Weimin's belongings,

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.490
I found a medicine bag from this clinic.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.700
I ran a composition analysis

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.330
on the drugs from the bag

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.530
and Li Shuting's case.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.770
They matched.

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.940
Chen Chuchuan is linked to the new drug?

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.250
Li Ming is related to Raw Diamond.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.090
Chen Chuchuan is linked to the new drug.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.810
One is your senior.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.180
The other is your junior.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:41.380
How else

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.050
are they linked?

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.730
How's Chen Chuchuan linked

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.490
to Raw Diamond?

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:45.810
You said

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.010
the person you saw in the fire

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:47.770
wasn't Li Ming.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.250
It was Chen Chuchuan?

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.900
Tell me.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:59.050
I have nothing to tell you.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.860
Regardless of if it's Chen Chuchuan,

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.090
we need evidence.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.900
Back off the case.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.460
I'll let you know when I find something.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.380
Han Feng!

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.530
I have to investigate

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.180
this case.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.380
I also need the truth.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.050
Your ties to him...

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.220
Stay out of it.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.420
What are you worried about?

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.490
Worried I'll lose control again?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.220
Or worried

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.140
that I'd help Chen Chuchuan?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.220
Han Feng,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.660
we're so close

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.420
to the truth.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.460
Mr. Han.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.090
We're all set for

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.250
Chen Chuchuan's arrest.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:52.290
Ms. Zhu.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.140
Mr. Qi,

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.220
we already know about the drugs.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.620
Please keep investigating.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.980
Hi.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.700
Please show me

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.770
your driving license.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:17.770
Any lead?

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.730
No.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.770
Keep at it.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.660
Yes.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.860
Haven't seen him.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.860
Sorry.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.490
Wan.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.570
No.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.730
Hello, sir.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.330
Hi.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.730
Have you seen

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.860
this guy?

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:45.900
No.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.810
Doesn't ring a bell.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.530
Could we check

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.570
your surveillance?

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.010
Sure.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.940
Come in, please.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.530
I swear.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.290
I...

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.570
I really know nothing.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.180
I didn't do anything, I...

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.220
We checked the surveillance

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.730
near Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.940
His car

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.940
was last seen

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.660
on the night of Hu Jie's death.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.460
After that, it vanished.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.770
He and his car

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.730
just vanished

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.620
without a trace.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.140
We set up checkpoints

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.180
around the clinic,

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.660
but found nothing.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.330
No sign of the tattooed man.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.330
Nearby shops all claim

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.090
they haven't seen Chen Chuchuan.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.180
So now,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.700
we're not just at a dead end.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.620
We're making zero progress.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.490
Mr. Qi.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.900
The medication from Song Weimin

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.180
has all been tested.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.490
It's all clear.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.700
Song Weimin's tox screen

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.420
was repeated.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.250
Same as before.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.490
No drug traces

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.660
left for comparison.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.730
The receptionist Maggie

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.420
said she hasn't

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.220
seen this new drug.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.570
We got nothing out of her.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:03.010
But it's confirmed

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:04.940
the packaging

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.490
is from their clinic.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.090
Maggie also said

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.620
Chen Chuchuan met Hu Jie.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.900
When he saw Hu Jie,

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.860
his face turned pale,

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.330
and he had Maggie leave immediately.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.900
Then,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.380
they two went into his office.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.530
No idea

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.290
what was said.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.490
No way.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.810
I didn't see him

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.810
on the nearby footage.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.940
That was a month ago.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.250
It's been deleted.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.730
Why did Hu Jie

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.250
go see Chen Chuchuan?

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.140
If we don't find Chen Chuchuan,

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.420
we can't confirm

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.090
if the prints on that old painting

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:37.980
are his.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.330
Well, keep searching.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.220
Coming.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.380
You really

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.810
don't know

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.140
how Fan Jiangxue died?

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.250
Where were you from 9 PM to 11 PM

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:56.940
on October 13th?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.570
At the clinic.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.620
To clean up

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.570
the scene that fast,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.620
the killer must have used

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.290
bleach or cleaner.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:04.810
The water was cut off here

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.660
that night.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.140
Someone can vouch for me.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.570
Who?

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.810
Qi Sizhe.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.620
The clinic

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.180
was thoroughly checked with luminol.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.530
No blood.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.250
Chen,

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.420
are you really

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.460
hiding nothing from me?

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.660
I need an answer too.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.380
I need the truth.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.940
Understand?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.810
Chen Chuchuan,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.980
Song Weimin's medication

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.180
came from you.
