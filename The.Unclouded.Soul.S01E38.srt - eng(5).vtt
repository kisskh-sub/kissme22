[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.910
[Episode 38]

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.330
The illusion beast.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.630
The illusion beast.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.759
No wonder Long Zhi failed her tribulation.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.430
She lost the protection
of the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.920
How...

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.840
How...

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.590
How could this happen?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.900
How did it come to this?

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.620
The Treasure House has a barrier.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.370
Only dragons can enter.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.310
The Dragon Essence Pearl
is a sacred dragon relic.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.960
Only those with dragon scales can open it.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.760
Who switched the Dragon Essence Pearl?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.510
Long Yu.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.000
Do you have anything to say?

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.990
A...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.840
A few days ago,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.760
I took Hong Ye to the Treasure House
to see the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.079
But I swear,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.880
we just looked at it.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.820
Really. It was just a look.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.750
I have no idea

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030
how the Pearl was switched.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.840
I knew it.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.400
Hong Ye was definitely up to no good

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.079
trying to get close to Dragon Lord.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.960
This little dragon
has caused such disaster.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.750
He should be banished from our clan!

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.200
Yes,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.079
banish him!

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.640
What I'm saying is all true.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.430
Hong Ye said

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.490
he wanted to prepare
a wedding gift for the Dragon Lord.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.630
That's why I agreed to show him.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.630
You...

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.870
Long Yu, how could you do this?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.530
I'll go find Hong Ye
and get to the bottom of this.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.470
Sister.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.690
If this is what you want,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960
I accept it.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.870
But please look back at me once more.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.240
Xiao Yao.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.030
As an Azure Dragon,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.510
your power has reached its peak.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.280
Why do you still want to
exterminate all other demons?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.100
Is it to avenge Hong Ye?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.960
Yes.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.020
Hong Ye!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.540
When you were slaughtering humans,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.620
did you ever imagine this day would come?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.710
You once said,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.890
either endure,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.750
or be ruthless.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.390
Either endure,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.900
or be ruthless,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.330
so you can stand firm.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.320
For tens of thousands of years,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.160
humans have suffered
under demon oppression.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.950
Unlike humans,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.850
you've enjoyed all the best
of heaven and earth,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.940
with nearly immortal lives.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.630
But from today,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.370
humans will no longer need to endure.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.430
With the Yuli Spring,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.540
it is now humans' turn

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.480
to hold dominion over this world.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.190
Xiao Yao gave everything for you.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.310
She loved you,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.100
protected you,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.480
and defied her own kind to marry you—

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.360
yet in the end,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.250
you merely used her!

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.710
How do you face her again?

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.420
[Happiness]

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.000
Xiao Yao...

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.230
will surely forgive me.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.340
Everything I've done

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.630
was so we could be together forever.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.159
[Happiness]

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.350
Ao Hen.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.040
Xiao Yao.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.700
The Yuli Spring

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.510
has finally appeared.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.160
So,

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.680
was everything—our marriage,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.560
having me try on the wedding robes—

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.480
all part of your plan?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.050
That's not true.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.120
You also pretended to be Ao Hen

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.560
and slaughtered the demons,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.120
right?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.430
Switching the Dragon Essence Pearl,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.159
using the illusion beast
to impersonate me,

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:42.430
and tricking them out of their pearls—

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.030
you did all that, didn't you?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.910
Protecting humans is my duty,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.220
but falling in love with you

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.510
was instinct.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.410
When I left the Dragon Palace,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.160
I realized

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.220
I had already fallen in love with you.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.290
I thought about giving up.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.830
In Ao Hen's cave,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.220
even when I was dying,

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.160
I still couldn't let you go.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.160
At that moment, I realized

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.630
how insignificant I was.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.480
I had no power to protect humans,

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.510
and I didn't even deserve

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.330
to stand before the one I love.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.080
Yes.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.670
I did all those things.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.560
I have to obtain the Yuli Spring

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.810
to be with you forever.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.480
Otherwise,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.550
I would have to watch helplessly...

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.620
watch my people

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.790
being trampled by demons again and again.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.500
Xiao Yao.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.760
Now I've finally defeated all the demons

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.160
and can stand before you.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.600
Look.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.250
The Yuli Spring is right ahead.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.470
If we take this step,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.060
I can protect the world together with you.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.700
I want to watch sunrises
and sunsets with you

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.260
for thousands of years,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.040
tens of thousands of years,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.070
never leaving your side.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.360
[Happiness]

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.500
Xiao Yao.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.810
I can finally truly stand by your side.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.270
It seemed just one step away,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.510
but it took so long,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:23.440
so, so, long.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.040
Immortality gained at the cost of lives,

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.280
does it truly bring happiness?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.240
You speak of humans as innocent—

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.730
but what about the demons?

Tainted with human desires,

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.490
these desires gathered together,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.190
and have taken physical form.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.210
My power can only fragment them.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.050
These scattered mirror fragments

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.700
contain all the suffering and resentment
of this world.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.120
When they are merged again,

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.330
chaos will descend once again.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.930
You must use all your strength

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.680
to prevent them from merging again.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.350
At the Dragon Lord's command!

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.840
Dragon Lord,

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.030
even if you pour
all your strength into it,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.880
you cannot bring him back to life.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.140
Why torment yourself?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.240
He may not return to life,

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.140
but he will not fall
into the cycle of reincarnation either.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.790
The Azure Dragon's power

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.610
can let him sleep for 5,000 years.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.110
When he awakens,

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:28.400
no human memories will remain.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.830
Let him

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.230
atone to the demons.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:45.920
Hong Ye,

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.050
you will not die.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.110
If you die,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.450
I will never be able to return.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.990
Our destinies

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.510
are bound together forever.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.540
Rest assured, Dragon Lord.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.310
I will cultivate here,

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.390
protecting Hong Ye

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.550
until he awakens.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.750
Thank you, Long Yu.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.180
But I need you to do three things.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.330
Even if it were thousands of tasks,

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.750
I am at your command.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.340
You are pure-hearted

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.220
and without ambition.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.000
First,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.810
I want you to cultivate diligently

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.950
and become the Monarch of All Demons.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.620
How is that possible?

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.090
The demon race has suffered a catastrophe,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.960
and their strength is greatly diminished.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.070
They need a leader with profound power

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.640
and upright character

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.920
to guide them in rebuilding.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.440
I didn't do well.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.570
I shall entrust you

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.780
with this important task.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:05.320
I...

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.240
I cannot promise,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.030
but I will try my best.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.830
Second,

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.190
Ao Hen, Qiong Qi, and Teng She

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.700
have been sealed off by human arrays.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.690
I want you to find suitable demons

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:24.920
to protect them well.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.110
I have failed them.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640
At your command.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.800
I will definitely accomplish it.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.440
Third,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.970
remove me from the dragon clan.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:39.370
In this world,

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.360
there will be no more
Azure Dragon Xiao Yao.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.870
Dragon Lord...

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.440
Today's outcome is all my fault.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.410
I don't deserve to be an Azure Dragon,

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.060
nor to be remembered by everyone.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.400
Promise me.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.000
Yes.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.480
Dragon Lord!

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.070
Dragon Lord!

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.460
Dragon Lord!

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.200
I didn't let you go back

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.790
because you couldn't bear the truth.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.270
For the past ten thousand years,

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.720
this world has not known lasting peace

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.440
despite your sacrifice.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.910
The temptation of the Yuli Spring
is too great.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.240
The mirror fragments separate and merge—

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.320
the wars between humans and demons
have grown ever more frequent.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.630
Qiong Qi, Ao Hen, and Teng She,

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.300
have all been resurrected.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.810
What will you choose to do now?

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:44.260
If I can't figure it out,
I'll just not think about it now.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.250
Past and present lives
are cause and effect of each other.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.110
When you open your eyes again,

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.750
you will face a world plunged
into chaos once more.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.750
Finally...

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.830
You're awake.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.890
Why are you so sad?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.680
I'm not sad.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.150
I'm happy.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.720
Where is this?

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.110
The Demons' Valley.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.270
The Demons' Valley?

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.480
Who are you?

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.440
I am your

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.740
old friend,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.270
Long Yu.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.000
My old friend?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.240
What about me?

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.920
Who am I?

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.570
You are Hong Ye.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.050
Xiao Yao.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.510
I'm sorry.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.350
Hong Ye and I have let everyone down.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.450
You already know the truth.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.590
Why do you still choose him?

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.240
Despite all of Hong Ye's mistakes,

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.750
he is my husband.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.890
He was 10,000 years ago,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.480
and he still is,10,000 years later.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.590
Hong Ye did harm the demons,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.120
and deceived you all.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.550
But you also slaughtered humans.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.590
This cycle of revenge will never end.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.930
Ten thousand years ago,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.860
after I learned the truth,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.090
I killed Hong Ye with my own hands.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.400
Five thousand years ago,

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.580
he awakened as a demon,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.770
with no memory of being human.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.400
For thousands of years,

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.380
he has been serving the demons.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.160
Perhaps by fate,

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.110
he has been repaying his debt.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.860
Thank you for accompanying me.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.430
You will always be my good brother.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.000
Ten thousand years have passed,

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.630
and I can still only be your brother?

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:24.780
Never mind.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:26.680
I promised you

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.480
I would never force you
to do anything you don't want to.

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:34.940
Teng She.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.480
Whenever I feel depressed,

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.710
you always cheer me up.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.230
You'd drink with me,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.270
and think of me in everything.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.450
We are the world's

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:53.450
closest siblings.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.330
If you hadn't

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.120
rescued me from the Chaos Clan,

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:09.450
I would still be

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.550
just a little earthworm.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.440
How could I become
the Teng She I am today?

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.300
I will forever be grateful to you.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.060
As long as you

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:23.950
can be happy.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.030
I once said

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.930
I will respect your choice.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.840
Since you've chosen him,

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.810
I will sincerely give you my blessing.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:49.360
Just as I did

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.330
10,000 years ago.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.830
I know you're cold on the outside
but warm inside.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.070
But I still hope

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.150
you can stop being too tough.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.720
In this world, besides winning and losing,

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.380
there is also true affection.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.170
You will definitely find

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.770
that special someone.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.800
Hong Ye and I

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.040
thank you for your generosity
and tolerance.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.960
But there's still a major issue

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.290
that we need to resolve.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.400
The 8 demon pearls

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.030
were later transformed
into mirror fragments

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.490
forming the Kunlun Mirror

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.010
which can open the gate
to the Yuli Spring.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.070
The Yuli Spring is

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.590
the source of all conflicts in this world.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.920
Therefore, we must seal it permanently.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.410
Yes.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.690
To seal the Yuli Spring completely,

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.980
we must destroy the Kunlun Mirror.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.400
Take out those four pieces
we already have first.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:05.910
These four mirror fragments

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.550
represent the four obsessions
of the human realm.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.600
Love and Separation.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.000
Lasting Resentment.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.489
Unattainable Desire.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.320
Unresolved Attachment.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.090
The remaining four pieces

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.840
represent
Birth, Aging, Sickness, and Death.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.800
Let's split into four groups

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.850
to find them—

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.889
how's that?

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.840
I take your silence as agreement.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.750
I'm still the same as before,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.880
always listening to Sister.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:48.030
I've always followed your orders.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.190
In that case,

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:53.820
let's make a bet.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.139
Let's see who finds the fragments first.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.550
Come.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.800
Let us

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.510
end this chaotic world together.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.150
This...

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.960
This is an omen of great disaster!

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.590
Meteor.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.510
The disaster star split into four!

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.400
We can't win this!

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.560
The world will be taken over by demons!

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.980
We can't defeat them!

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.110
Run!

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.670
Run!

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.320
Hurry!

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.510
Ridiculous!

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.380
The demons haven't even attacked yet,

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.440
and you're already in disarray.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.920
You're an Imperial Guard—

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.440
you lose your dignity just like this?

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.050
A mere Feiyu Guard like you

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:33.210
doesn't get to point fingers
at us Imperial Guards.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.360
We are all the Emperor's personal guards.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.370
Drawing your blade
before the Imperial Guard

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.830
is equivalent to treason!

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.280
This is a matter of life and death.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.770
If anyone else dares to disrupt morale,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.580
they will be executed!

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.410
After the battle is over,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.880
you can file complaints
when we return to the capital.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.960
But now,

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:09.550
pick up your weapons

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.610
and aim at Demons' Valley!

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.660
Where are we going now?

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.870
The North Sea.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.400
Is a fragment of the Kunlun Mirror there?

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.710
Ten thousand years ago,

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.400
the North Sea
was a domain of the dragon clan.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.800
The dragons nurtured
the Dragon Essence Pearl there.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.210
My Master was the last of the dragon clan,

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.640
but I never heard him mention this.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.130
Was your Master named Long Yu?

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.520
You met him
when you went back 10,000 years ago?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.110
Yes.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.180
I once asked my Master

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.080
what the world was like before.

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.330
But he always kept it secret.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:46.820
Xiao Yao.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.620
What exactly happened 10,000 years ago?

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.500
That's a very long story.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.200
Are you ready to hear it?

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.970
My Lord.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.420
Congratulations.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.710
Given our current situation,

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.280
what is there to celebrate?

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.470
Congratulations on your increased power.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.820
Now your demon-slaying blade
can not only kill demons,

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.130
but humans as well.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.490
In today's world,

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.230
have humans and demons
truly become indistinguishable?

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.510
It doesn't matter

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.550
if it's human or demon anymore.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.670
You don't have much time left.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:47.440
Those four shooting stars in the sky

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.320
were three ancient great demons
and Hong Ye.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.280
They've split up now

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.590
with only one purpose.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.170
The Kunlun Mirror.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.880
They're moving so quickly,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.630
I fear they've already located
the mirror fragments.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.900
If they collect all the fragments,

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.730
we may never have another chance.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.070
The old demon is right.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:17.650
They've gone in four directions—
north, south, east, and west.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:19.650
We can use our numbers against them.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.400
With the full force of the Feiyu Guard,

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.110
we can defeat them one by one.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.080
We still have a chance.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.420
Which one should we target first?

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.180
[Hong Ye] [Qiong Qi] [Ao Hen] [Teng She]

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:35.840
The closest one.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.420
It has already reached Mount Buchou.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.610
Are there any demons left?

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.230
You're too late.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.220
The humans have taken everything
worth taking.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.280
I'm the only one left—

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.110
an old demon with no spiritual energy.
