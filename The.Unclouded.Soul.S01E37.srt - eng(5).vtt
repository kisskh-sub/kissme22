[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 37]

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.590
Qiong Qi Clan is actually

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.150
so weak and lame without the sun.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.479
Check out on the inside.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.870
It's an ambush!

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.400
Retreat!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.530
I've waited so long for you.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.200
These weapons

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.890
are mostly ordinary

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.800
and mixed with items stolen from

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.060
mountain demons and the Lightning Clan.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.240
Based on these alone,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.810
it's difficult to determine

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.410
the attackers' identities.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.670
Why are you looking at me?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.240
What?

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.690
Is that not allowed?

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.360
Ao Hen's very presence at this moment

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.150
proves he has nothing to do with this,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.750
and that he's ready to help us
find the culprit.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.370
That's right.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.190
If the attack had been Ao Hen's doing,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.850
he would've

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.590
either completely concealed himself,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.079
or

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.590
shown his face instead of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
bothering wearing this mask,
given his temperament.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840
By putting on this mask,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.290
the culprit was basically doing this...

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.390
Hey!

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.740
Attention!

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.310
I'm definitely not Teng She!

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.240
I'm not Teng She.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.840
You can't see me.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.560
I'm invisible.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.760
You just can't see me.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.840
You can't see...

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.220
Why are you all defending him?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.470
Because when your clan was attacked
yesterday,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.040
the three of us were together.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.190
Ao Hen never left.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.240
What were you guys doing?

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.830
We were... drinking!

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.350
Slaughter has happened to every clan.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.780
It's known to all demons.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.120
If Ao Hen were innocent,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.159
he should've come forward to explain.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.990
Don't tell me

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.880
you never knew those atrocities!

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.950
I don't owe anyone any explanation

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.950
for whatever I do.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.750
You...

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.800
Ao Hen was concentrating
on his cultivation previously,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.950
so he really didn't know those incidents.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.600
Thank you.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.380
No worries.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.850
How very polite of you guys.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.560
I have some dragon bells here.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.660
When one of them is rung,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.900
all the others,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.310
however far apart they are,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.160
will sound and resonate promptly.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.090
Should anyone encounter an enemy,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.950
just ring the dragon bell,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.720
and the rest of us will come help.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.240
Agreed?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.310
Agreed.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.760
Agreed.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.520
During our wedding,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.400
we will need to

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.520
honor our ancestors

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.820
and bow to heaven and earth

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.620
while dressed in proper attire.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.210
I invited you over today

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.930
so you could try on your wedding gown.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.070
If there's any problem,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.730
we'll have it altered in time.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.740
Hong Ye!

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.560
I showed up uninvited.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.810
Would you mind?

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.750
Of course not.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.140
He insisted on tagging along

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.200
upon learning that I was coming here.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.020
That said,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.190
Long Yu did contribute significantly

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.680
to persuading all branches

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.740
of the Dragon Clan.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.560
Then I owe

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.900
many thanks to Long Yu.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.510
The Dragon Lord is delighted
just at the sight of you.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.310
So I realized I must help the two of you
get married.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.870
People don't seem afraid anymore

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.930
when they see me and Long Yu this time.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.990
They've all thought it through.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.270
Just like humans,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.070
there are good and bad demons.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.200
Go try on the dress.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.659
We'll be waiting outside.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.260
Sure.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:49.430
Let's go.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.830
Yes.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.990
I was the architect of your romance.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.040
How are you going to thank me?

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.180
This way, please.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.620
Please try on the dress, Dragon Lord.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.120
I've noticed that Xiao Yao looks

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.310
a bit unwell today.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.130
Is she still bothered by the hunt

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.990
for Ao Hen Clan?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.880
Ao Hen isn't the culprit.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.610
Then who is?

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.950
It's not clear yet.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.400
But don't worry.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.000
Before your wedding,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.860
the Dragon Lord will surely catch
the real culprit.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.240
Your Majesty,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.070
the Dragon Lord has put on the dress.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.870
You may leave.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.000
I'll go take a look.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.430
Enjoy the feast.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.750
Yes.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:32.690
Why stare at me?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.970
I just can't take my eyes off

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.850
the most beautiful bride in the world.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.140
What did you do to Xiao Yao?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.670
I only had the illusion beast

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.600
record her appearance and breath.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.120
Whoever wears this wedding dress
in the future

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.100
will morph into the Dragon Lord.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.750
After Xiao Yao marries me,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.390
she'll protect humans with all her might.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.990
I genuinely want to marry her

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.150
only for who she is

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.400
and nothing else.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.630
We've already benefited

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.960
tremendously from her.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.680
How can we despicably use her again?

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.480
Your Majesty,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.910
I beg to disagree.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.360
She is the Dragon Lord.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.580
If she knows what we've done,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.120
will she still marry you?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.450
Will she let us gather
all the demon pearls?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.400
That Water Dragon also said

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.200
before the wedding,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.860
the Azure Dragon would definitely
end the current chaotic world.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.880
Your Majesty,

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.030
we must act now,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.080
or all our efforts will be in vain.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.000
What's worse,
catastrophes will befall us humans.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.150
But if we find Yuli Spring
before the wedding,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.370
the world order will undergo
a fundamental change.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.370
Then everything will be different.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.540
If the human realm falls,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.790
will Your Majesty still get a chance

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.680
to be on equal footing

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.660
with the Dragon Lord, let alone marry her?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.500
Our only hope is pinned on
her wedding dress.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.920
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.790
Xiao Yao?

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.480
You...

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.390
I can't believe you'd come meet me
on your own accord.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.850
Aren't you happy about it?

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.800
Of course I'm happy.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.170
It just seems...

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.740
that something's off.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.200
Your dress...

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.480
I'm here to tell you something.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.250
What is it?

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.600
I'm getting married.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.630
You are?

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.510
On the day of the next new moon,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.150
namely the first day of the eighth month
in human calendar,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.120
I hope to see you

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.640
at my wedding

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.190
with the Primordial Pearl

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.370
and to receive your blessings.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.770
Who's the groom?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.460
Hong Ye, the human emperor.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.280
Hong Ye?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.780
You're serious about him?

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.300
He's a human,

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.480
and humans are the lowliest of creatures,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.480
while you are an Azure Dragon.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.480
-How can that inferior...
-Shut up!

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.790
Qiong Qi,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.950
we've known each other since childhood.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.860
In my heart,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.870
I consider you my family.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.030
I know

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.130
you care for me

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.120
and protect me

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.630
like an older brother.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.140
Hong Ye and I are genuinely in love.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.870
I understand

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.390
lots of demons will oppose
my union with him.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.090
Qiong Qi Clan is highly revered.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.450
I believe your presence

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.670
will subdue many voices of dissent.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.630
But if even you don't come to support me,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.730
then I'll be truly alone and helpless.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.720
Fine.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.360
Anyway, as a human, Hong Ye won't live

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.690
for more than 100 years.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:54.750
I'll pretend

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.810
that you're just off on a trip,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.840
and wait 100 years

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.590
till you make a new choice.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.670
Then it's settled.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.890
Remember

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.720
to attend my wedding with...

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.980
The Primordial Pearl.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.390
I'll just take a peek.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.760
Only one glance.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.530
This is inappropriate.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.490
Avert my eyes.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.650
Avert my eyes.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.210
Yao.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.590
I...

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.540
I'm sorry.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.050
I didn't mean to do that.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.630
Actually...

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.000
I didn't see anything.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.130
I was just wondering

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.480
if I could do anything

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.880
to ease the heavy burden
on your shoulders.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.030
Please don't look at me that way.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.830
I'm scared.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.040
I was really just trying to help.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:30.980
However,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.760
what can you help me with?

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.370
Take it for your use.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.150
Don't you only come to me

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:43.270
when you need to borrow the Mist Pearl?

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.550
Who are you looking for this time?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.280
Is it Hong Ye?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.120
Ao Hen?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:46.890
Or...

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:48.080
Whoever is fine!

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.020
Use it then.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.840
This time, I'm looking for nobody,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.010
but you.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.910
Me?

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.430
This has never happened before.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.460
Just tell me

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.080
what you need me to do.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.410
I promise to get it done.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:07.830
I'd like to invite you

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.720
to my wedding in the human realm

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.380
on the day of the next new moon.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.480
You're getting married so soon?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.520
Didn't you say

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.750
you sincerely wished me

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.480
all the best and sheer joy?

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.360
Yes, I did.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.790
As long as

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.070
Hong Ye treats you right,

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.010
I'll do as you say, Yao.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.240
Hong Ye and I have been

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.630
through a lot to get to
the point of marriage.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.960
The sacred relic of each clan

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.420
can offer protection and bestow blessings.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.610
Would you bring the Mist Pearl

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.100
to my wedding
on behalf of all vine serpents,

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.440
so it can confer blessings upon me?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.599
Sure.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:09.790
I knew

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.599
you had my best interests at heart.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.849
Then it's settled.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.130
By the way,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.520
would you please tell Ao Hen in my stead

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:20.089
that

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.550
he's also cordially invited to my wedding?

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.680
Ask him to bring along the sacred relic

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.760
of Ao Hen Clan,
if he still values my friendship with him.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:29.750
On my wedding day,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.550
I'd like to have a drink with him.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.750
Got it.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:35.590
I need to be somewhere else now.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.250
Thank you for doing me a favor.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.070
Don't forget the date

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.440
is the first day of the eighth month

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.500
in human calendar.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.760
Both Qiong Qi

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.060
and Teng She

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.500
have agreed to bring

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.730
their pearls to my wedding.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.110
I guess...

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.240
Ao Hen will come too.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.350
Great.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.070
We've already got the Earth Pearl
from the Mountain Demon Clan,

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.270
the Thunder Pearl from the Lightning Clan,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.240
the Celestial Pearl from the Fox Clan,

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.550
and the Wind Calming Pearl from Bi Fang.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.830
When we attain
Qiong Qi's Primordial Pearl,

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.030
Teng She's Mist Pearl,

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.830
and Ao Hen's Universe Pearl,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.910
Your Majesty,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.830
we'll need nothing more but—

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.050
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.870
Your Majesty,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.850
our long quest of pearls
is finally coming to an end.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:37.450
[Happiness]

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.620
Under no circumstances...

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.840
should any harm be caused to Xiao Yao.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.230
Got it.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.300
I was just wondering about
this familiar smell.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.720
It turns out you're really around.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.510
Given how much you enjoyed the food
last time,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.370
I thought I'd bring you some more.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.720
I'm beginning to understand

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.680
why the Dragon Lord

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.210
is determined to marry you.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.070
You...

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.870
came from afar

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.680
not just to bring me food, right?

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.220
Do you need my help?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:31.510
I can't stop thinking

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.600
that Xiao Yao must be making

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.690
a big sacrifice by marrying me,

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.590
though she never mentions it.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.260
Maybe I can somewhat make up for it

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.560
with considerate gestures.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.400
The Dragon Lord certainly deserves

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.270
the best and the most

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.670
thoughtful gifts of all.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.920
You know what?

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.120
After getting married,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.920
human women usually take

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.480
their husbands' last names.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.250
But Xiao Yao will be an exception.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.450
After she marries me,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.450
I hope both demons and humans will still

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.480
respect her as the Dragon Lord,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.160
instead of the human empress
bound by ties of affection.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.090
That's for sure.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.510
Therefore,

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.590
I'm planning to make her

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.920
a unique empress crown.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.920
I intend to search worldwide

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.420
for treasures to craft

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.190
a piece of jewelry similar to
the precious Dragon Essence Pearl

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.920
and place it on top of the crown.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.210
It will not only

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.110
demonstrate her eminence,

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.340
but also show

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.110
my sincerity to the dragon clan.

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.170
That's a good idea.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.020
But no human

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.790
has ever seen

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.470
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.320
How's that a problem?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.550
You can just ask the Dragon Lord

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.750
to show you the pearl.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.720
But the crown won't be a surprise for her

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.720
if she knows about it so soon, right?

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.110
You're right.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.160
How about

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.550
you sneak me into the Dragon Palace

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.680
for a peek at the Dragon Essence Pearl?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.110
I'll just take one glance.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.110
Then I'll be gone.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.000
I swear not to cause you trouble.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.740
I suppose I can do that.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.200
Six chests of pearls.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.590
Twelve bolts of fine silk.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.790
Twenty-four boxes of garments
and twenty-four sets of jewelry.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.960
Conduct a thorough check.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.220
Yes.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.680
Yes.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.550
The coral doesn't look good enough.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.510
Replace it with a better piece.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.790
Yes.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.240
Everyone, be careful.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.790
No mistake is allowed

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.030
in such trivial preparation work
for the Dragon Lord's wedding.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:33.720
Yes.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.050
I need to keep a closer eye on everything.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.510
Jade...

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.590
You'll undergo a tribulation soon.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.750
Focus on your cultivation now.

00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:45.610
You shouldn't be bothered

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.210
with these trivial matters.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.070
I just feel obligated to make

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.350
everything perfect for you, Dragon Lord.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.440
To me, perfection is

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.640
when you survive the tribulation
and attend my wedding

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.830
as a winged dragon.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.870
Dragon Lord,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.270
if I make it through the tribulation,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:04.260
will you forgive me

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.070
for all my wrongdoing?

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.510
What kind of silly talk is that?

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.440
Do you think I'd really be mad at you

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.210
for our occasional bickering?

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.370
Am I that petty

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.620
in your eyes?

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.570
No.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.140
I was overthinking it.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.240
I've prepared something for you.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:21.970
Come with me.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.790
This golden armor has been altered

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.640
according to your measurements.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.590
You should wear it

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.720
for your tribulation,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.980
as it'll ease the pain.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.050
No, I can't.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.480
This is a one-of-a-kind suit of armor

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.510
exclusive to you, an Azure Dragon.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.440
How can I wear it?

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.770
Why not?

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.320
I'm waiting for the day

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.960
when you become an Azure Dragon

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.620
and take over my responsibility
of protecting all living beings.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.830
The Dragon Lord ordered

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.200
to bring more spirit herbs
and shells for humans.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:58.580
Yes.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.070
Yes.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.270
Send the items to storage.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:10.550
Yes.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.090
Such premium luminous pearls.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.640
Where are they from?

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.680
They're a tribute
from the Tiger Shark Clan

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.310
for the Dragon Lord's wedding.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.650
Are they being sent to the Treasure House?

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.310
Exactly.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.920
Let me do it for you.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.880
Go attend to other things.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.550
Hold them tight.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.410
Don't drop any.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.980
Sure thing. Off you go.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.400
Come over!

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.500
Hold these.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.170
Follow me.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.170
Which is the Dragon Essence Pearl?

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.240
Right here.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.700
Come on.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.520
Over here.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.710
This is...

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.880
The sacred relic of the dragon clan.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.480
Only when it senses a dragon's breath

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.740
will it reveal itself.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.090
Have you got a good look?

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.870
Yes, I have.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.390
Great.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.620
Then let's leave.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.980
I'm sorry.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:51.500
What did you just do?

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.860
Nothing.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.940
Alright, let's go.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.030
Wait.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.920
Hurry up.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.400
Go with me.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:24:59.980
Let's go.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.200
Someone's trying to steal
the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.020
How very bold.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.260
They won't be able to leave alive.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.470
All of you, exit the room.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.050
Nothing is missing.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.270
This is odd.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.640
Dragon Lord,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.960
Ao Hen and Teng She
are waiting in the hall.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.480
Yao,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.200
how is the Dragon Essence Pearl?

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.140
It's safe and intact.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.610
Where is the thief?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.750
Where is he?

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:56.750
Where?

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.520
Where is the thief?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.170
The thief already ran away.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:07.170
Has your dowry been prepared yet?

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.310
Yes.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.910
Quite a lot of treasures indeed.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.290
Could it be that your dowry

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.120
has become someone's target?

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200
A false alarm though it was,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.130
you've all been brought here by it.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.460
Let me make this clear:

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.720
all of you

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.390
must attend my wedding.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.380
Otherwise,

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.590
I won't be friends with you anymore.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.650
If I were a better fighter than you,

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:33.990
I would definitely take you away
from your wedding.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:35.160
Don't worry, Yao.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.750
I...

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.600
will surely be there.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.770
I'll also be there
with what you asked for.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.570
All I ask is for you to have a good time
at my wedding.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.430
Don't cause any trouble.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.040
If you do consider me a friend and family,

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.080
then give me your blessings.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.790
That was a close call.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.440
Fortunately, they didn't spot us.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.030
Thank you

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.870
for fulfilling my wish.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.660
To return my favor,

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.400
just treat the Dragon Lord right.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.260
I look forward to seeing

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.120
the empress crown

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.920
of you own making at the wedding.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.960
Sure.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.050
[Next day of the new moon]

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.690
[First day of the eighth month
in human calendar]

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.270
Teng She,

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.670
you're quite enthusiastic
about everything.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.920
I would definitely attend Yao's wedding,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.450
since I gave her my promise,

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.260
unlike a certain demon

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.630
who had no choice but to

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.830
show up in the end

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.440
after claiming he'd rather

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.590
be beaten to death by Yao

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.190
than let Hong Ye off the hook.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.040
If you hadn't stood in my way,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.110
Hong Ye wouldn't have lived
to see this day.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.570
Fine.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.260
Go catch him again now.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.070
But don't act crazy

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.550
in front of me again when things blow up.

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:38.650
Teng She, shut up.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.240
He wasted so much of my wine.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.300
With me being here,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.030
nobody will have the guts or the chance

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.830
to force Xiao Yao to do anything!

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.200
I just haven't criticized you, alright?

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.600
You are the one who always

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.480
pushes Yao into a fight with you.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.200
What a shabby wedding.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.510
If I had foreseen Xiao Yao had to make
such a big compromise,

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:58.550
I would've told her

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:00.200
my feelings for her a thousand years ago,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.330
so as to spare her from such suffering.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.800
You should be glad

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.200
that you didn't do it.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.980
Otherwise, you would've lost her
a thousand years ago.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.630
Who are you to comment on my matters?

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.920
Xiao Yao had nothing to do with you
in the first place.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.960
You were just delusional

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680
and pursuing her relentlessly.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.400
You silly

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.680
simpleton.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.330
The chances for two

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.880
to start a romance decrease with time.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.160
You've been around Yao the longest,

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.880
which means you stand the least chance
of winning her over.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.270
You have a death wish or what?

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.830
Enough!

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:32.430
Anyway,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.720
Yao will be single again
in a hundred years.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.310
Let's have a fair competition

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.970
for her a hundred years later.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.550
May the best man win.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:42.830
Agreed.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.230
After cultivating for a thousand years,

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.630
I'm about to undergo another tribulation.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.830
I pray to you, all dragon ancestors,
for the luck

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.310
to go through the tribulation

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.970
and to become a winged dragon.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.790
May the heavens grant

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.880
Long Zhi

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.510
success in passing the tribulation

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.170
and becoming a winged dragon.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.240
Grant her success
in passing the tribulation

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.900
and becoming a winged dragon.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.000
How do you feel?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.830
With the support of the seniors' spirits,

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.760
aren't you feeling energized now?

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.850
Don't be afraid.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.720
We've prepared so long for this.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.440
I'm sure you'll survive the tribulation.

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:11.080
I hope so.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.170
[Happiness]

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.830
This is only a human wedding,

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.290
yet it looks like a ceremony
to worship gods.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.000
You truly are my real friends.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:40.950
I knew

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.260
you would all come.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.230
We all...

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:46.930
want you to be happy, Yao.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.720
In the future,

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:50.830
if Hong Ye ever upsets you,

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.170
I'll cut him into a million pieces.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.570
Oh, right.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.720
Where is Hong Ye?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.250
How come he hasn't shown up?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.110
Humans observe their own customs.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.200
Women are respected, and men are honored.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.700
The groom will not appear

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.640
until everything is ready.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.260
Let me be clear.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.740
I did promise you not to cause trouble,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.510
but only provided

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.640
that Hong Ye wouldn't go out of bounds.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.450
We're already here.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.270
Let's all follow

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.840
the human customs today.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.600
Let's go.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:24.190
Come on.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.400
Hong Ye and I are deeply grateful

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.700
to be graced

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.960
with your presence.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.080
Please give us your blessings.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.680
This is not demonic power at all.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:55.840
Xiao Yao,

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:57.770
did you lay this ambush for us?

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.190
Did you plan for all this?

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.250
Did you also disguise

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.840
as Ao Hen to slaughter

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.090
other demon clans?

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.770
You told me

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.590
you would protect all living beings.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.909
Is that how you do it?

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.630
Yao,

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:15.320
does a thousand years of companionship

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.120
really mean less
than the marriage to that human male?

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:18.920
Xiao Yao,

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.370
are you going to destroy all demons

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.130
just in order to marry a human?

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.960
The Dragon Essence Pearl
of the dragon clan,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.000
formed by primordial dragon spirits,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.060
possesses earth-shattering power.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.280
The Universe Pearl of Ao Hen Clan

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.840
carries the power to overturn and reverse.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.230
The Primordial Pearl of Qiong Qi Clan

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.159
has the power of primordial chaos.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.840
The Mist Pearl of vine serpents

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.969
contains the power to track and trace.

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.150
The Earth Pearl of the Mountain Demon Clan

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.120
has the natural power to nurture lives.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.880
The Thunder Pearl of the Lightning Clan

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.480
can release power of suppression.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.150
The Wind Calming Pearl of Bi Fang Clan

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.360
possesses the power
to dissipate fog and haze.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.960
The Celestial Pearl of the Fox Clan

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.630
consists of the power of yin and yang.

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.760
All the eight pearls are gathered now.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.360
We humans' aspiration to gain strength
is manifested to heaven and earth.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.190
Humans should not be exterminated.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.070
We beseech you, deities, to reveal

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.330
the celestial mountain and Yuli Spring!

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.340
This...

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.230
What's going on?

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:00.030
It's an unusual phenomenon.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.590
Why would this happen?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:01.050
This...

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.070
This scene...

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.360
What caused this unusual phenomenon?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.080
Yeah.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.630
Something must be wrong.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:06.370
This is bad.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.520
Dragon Lord, watch out!

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:10.510
Dragon Lord, be careful!

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.070
Long Zhi!

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.590
Dragon Lord, don't bother.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.920
I've failed to pass the tribulation.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.400
No one can save me now.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.480
With the protection of dragon ancestors,

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.340
you'll be fine.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.920
I did too much evil.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.290
The ancestors won't protect me anymore.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.060
In fact, I already had a hunch long ago

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.820
that I couldn't overcome this tribulation.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.680
I shouldn't have wasted
that golden armor of yours.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.210
It's nothing compared to your life.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.890
I only want you to be well.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:50.670
Xiao Yao...

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.060
Actually, I've been

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.740
keeping a secret from you.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.080
What is it?

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.580
I once slaughtered humans

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:04.730
in the name of Ao Hen.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.690
As you finally transformed
into an Azure Dragon,

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.560
you fell deeply in love with a human.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.500
I tried to dissuade you many times,

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.480
yet instead of taking my advice,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.740
you became increasingly devoted to him.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.210
It pained me to see you
persist in this mistake,

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.640
so I sneaked into the human clan

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.770
with an attempt to kill Hong Ye

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.230
in Ao Hen's name.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.340
We humans have never had anything

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.170
to do with Ao Hen Clan.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.210
How could you kill people

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.050
without cause?

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.190
Humans are lowly creatures.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.720
No reason is needed
to exterminate your kind.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.110
Father...

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.880
Long Zhi,

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.450
you...

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.010
I slaughtered the innocent

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.110
and thus lost heaven's blessing

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.110
and failed to pass the tribulation.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.550
But I have no regrets.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.030
Dragons are noble beings

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:31.030
that must never be dragged down by humans.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.170
But humans won't remain weak forever.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.570
Then it's all the more reason
to prevent them from using

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.030
an Azure Dragon's power
to find Yuli Spring.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.110
Humans have long been oppressed by demons.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.990
Should they achieve immortality,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.360
they will definitely provoke conflicts.

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.620
Long Zhi.

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.230
Did you also slaughter

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.760
mountain demons
and those of the Lightning Clan

00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.360
and the Fox Clan?

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.070
No.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.930
I didn't do any of that.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:05.070
Xiao Yao,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.070
hate me all you want.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.910
But you must remember one thing:

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.290
no tribulation can be harder to overcome

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.820
than the tribulation of love.

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.900
If you devote all your heart
to Hong Ye alone,

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.550
there will be a day

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.810
when dragons turn against you.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.550
Long Zhi.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.030
Long Zhi!

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:45.960
Long Zhi!
