WEBVTT

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.439
This guy is from Coal Mine Old Street.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.920
He never tried to kill Zhao Fengsheng before.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.920
Made me lose the incense.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.960
Then later, he let Zhou Xiaoman escape.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.119
If his sister wasn't in my hands,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.759
he would've run back to Old Street long ago.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.640
Then I think he has more guts than you.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Uncle Wolf.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.799
Uncle Wolf, give me another chance.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.600
I will definitely prove my worth to you.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.520
Useless people are trash.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.359
If you want to work under

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.439
Uncle Gui Lang, the underground emperor of Bianshui,

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.599
you need to have some value.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.239
Young Master Tang isn't visiting brothels.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.280
What brings you to my

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.599
wolf's den?

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.319
Your wolf's den is creepy.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.319
If it wasn't for important business,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:22.560
how would I dare disturb you?

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.959
Move him away.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.640
Don't offend Young Master Tang's sight.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:36.239
Young Master Tang.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.159
Speak your mind.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.760
Everyone here is one of us.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.400
I'd like to ask Uncle Wolf to step in

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.359
and take Coal Mine Old Street.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.920
Old Street?

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.000
Your Tang family is interested in that dump?

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.760
You know,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.519
in my free time, I like to play with women.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.879
I finally took a liking to two top-notch goods,

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.760
and they were both snatched by Old Street punks.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.159
Can I swallow that insult?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.520
There are punks in Bianshui

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.439
who dare to steal Young Master Tang's women?

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.840
Mr. Mu was there that day too.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.039
What's his name?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.879
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.319
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.479
That's the little thief who forced me to blow up the fishing boat.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.919
Jin Fu.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400
Have you fought him?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.319
It was a draw.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.680
A small-time punk ruined my business

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.719
and stole Young Master Tang's women.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.840
Even Jin Fu couldn't handle him.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280
Now I'm a bit interested.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.680
This guy is the one sticking his neck out in Coal Mine Old Street.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.000
If you want to take Old Street,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.599
this guy will definitely be in the way.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.439
Once we take down Zhao Fengsheng,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.159
no one in Old Street will dare to step up again.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.400
Then your Ghost Face Hall expands its influence,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.439
and our Tang family takes over Old Street's businesses.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.919
It's a win-win situation.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:02.759
Our Ghost Face Hall

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.039
has no interest in that dump.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.479
As I said,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.639
the price.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.280
Name any price.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:12.560
I heard your father's

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.960
underground casino

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.400
is piled high with gold bars.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.199
I've always wanted to see what a gold mountain

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.360
looks like.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.319
No

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.199
problem.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.960
Then I'll wait for Uncle Wolf's good news to trade.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.080
Jin Fu.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.439
Assign a few skilled men to Wuya.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.360
Give him a chance to redeem himself.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.080
Come.

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.199
Thank you, Uncle Wolf.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.080
Thank you, Uncle Wolf.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:44.800
This time,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.560
I will definitely kill Zhao Fengsheng

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:48.919
and take Old Street.

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.840
If you fail again this time,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.680
when you pass by the Meijiang River, jump in.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:59.759
Don't come back up.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.120
What?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520
Try on a wedding dress?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.639
Tianyu, you're getting married?

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.480
Why haven't I heard you mention it before?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.600
Yeah.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.600
I just met someone I really like.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.360
So I can't wait to marry him.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.959
Yaqing.

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.079
You know very well

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:26.480
I like big heroes.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.480
But I've been so busy lately.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.680
So I want to ask you

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.240
to go try on a wedding dress for me.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.680
My wedding date is really urgent.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.480
Anyway, you live so close to the bridal shop,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.720
and our figures are so similar.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.959
Please help me out.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:39.759
It's settled then.

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.519
Love you.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.279
Tianyu.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.000
Big Brother.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.680
We've blocked off

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.959
all the exits of Old Street.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.920
Anyone who comes out,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.120
beat them up on sight.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.040
Until they hand over Zhao Fengsheng.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.319
Let them fight among themselves.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.040
Brother Wuya.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.240
That's a brilliant move.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:11.680
Stop!

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720
What are you doing?

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.959
Zhao Fengsheng from your Old Street

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.439
stole goods from our Daixiang Village.

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.360
From today on, Old Street won't know peace

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.279
until that Zhao Fengsheng

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.079
goes to Ghost Face Hall to kowtow and apologize.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480
Daixiang Village?

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.879
That's the village that traffics children, right?

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.519
My Xiaoxiao...

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:29.040
You damn bitch!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.920
Watch out or I'll chop your tongue off!

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.439
Brother, sir.

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.279
My friend here

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.040
doesn't know how to speak properly.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040
We're really sorry.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.360
We'll go back right now.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:37.319
We're going back.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.120
You can leave,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.360
but leave the stuff for me.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.319
Go!

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:40.839
Get lost!

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.839
Get lost!

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.439
Get lost!

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:43.160
Go!

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:44.399
Get the hell out of here!

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.920
Are you leaving or not?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.399
Get lost!

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.759
How can you still sleep?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.199
And you're actually sleeping?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.800
Zhao Fengsheng

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.759
Get up!

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:05.079
What?

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.399
Can't even sleep in peace.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.120
Wait.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.439
Didn't you give me two days?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.079
Qian Zongran will explain everything tomorrow.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:15.000
Why can't you even wait that long?

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.199
I'm asking you.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.079
Did you steal Daixiang Village's goods?

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.399
And beat up their men?

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:23.079
So you finally found out.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:24.319
It was you after all.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.839
Of course it was me.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.639
I knew it!

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.120
You're the one who caused all this trouble in Old Street.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.319
What are you pretending for?

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.920
You stole from Daixiang Village.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.480
And blew up their boat!

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.879
Now they've come knocking.

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.000
Neighbors!

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.360
Are you deaf?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.240
Shengzi!

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.160
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.160
He fought Daixiang Village's traffickers.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.399
How could he be a trafficker then?

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:47.600
It's him double-crossing them.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.959
He took all the benefits.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.279
And we neighbors suffer the consequences!

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.199
Exactly!

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:54.399
Daixiang Village people gave Xiaoxiao a poisoned shot.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.959
I risked my life to save him.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:56.920
How come to you people,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.000
it's just a double-cross?

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.199
Don't you mention Xiaoxiao!

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.800
I damn well will mention him!

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.680
What are you doing?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.600
I worked my ass off to save Xiaoxiao.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.360
My brother Hualian

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.759
is still missing, alive or dead.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.519
You got bullied by Daixiang Village,

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.800
didn't even dare to fart in protest.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.000
Now you come to frame me?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.519
I shouldn't have bothered with your son!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.480
Look at the mess you made!

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.199
And you blame me?

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.839
I...

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.680
I can't be bothered with you.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.439
Everyone out!

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.199
I want to sleep!

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.399
You!

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.480
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.360
We told you to leave, you didn't.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.680
Now you've caused trouble.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.480
Don't tell me

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.199
you expect the neighbors to take the fall?

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.000
Right!

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.120
Your mother died young.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.920
If you'd missed one meal of our charity,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.079
you wouldn't be alive today.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:31.720
Yes.

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:34.040
If not for remembering your kindness,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.600
why would I bother with Old Street's affairs?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.439
But ever since I came back,

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:39.319
when have you ever treated me as one of you?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.160
What did we do wrong?

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:42.879
Yeah!

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.639
Everyone, stop arguing!

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.519
The doctor already said

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.720
Xiaoxiao will wake up soon.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.319
Whether Zhao Fengsheng is a trafficker

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.439
we'll know once we ask.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.360
Really?

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600
Xiaoxiao is getting better?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.839
Shengzi.

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.759
Then let's wait for Xiaoxiao to wake up.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.639
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.600
The people from Daixiang Village

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.160
are now demanding you go out and apologize.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.600
What do you plan to do about it?

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.560
Apologize to those traffickers?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.079
Grab your tools and fight them!

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.120
Reckless bravery.

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.279
An ant trying to shake a tree.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.079
Uncle She.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.079
What are you saying?

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.800
I'm afraid you don't know.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.319
Behind Daixiang Village is Uncle Gui Lang.

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:20.439
How can we fight them?

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.279
Neighbors!

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.959
If you trust me,

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:26.160
no matter what ghosts or wolves,

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:27.279
I have plenty of ways

00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:28.879
to drive those beasts away.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.720
That's right!

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.120
So what about Uncle Gui Lang?

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.279
If he wants to shit and piss all over our Old Street,

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:35.759
are you gonna open your mouths and catch it?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.519
You... you!

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.720
How dare you talk like that!

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.600
What an attitude!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.399
Enough arguing!

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.159
We old-timers aren't dead yet.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.240
Old Street has always been at the border of three countries.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.720
For years here, it's always been

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.360
whatever Uncle Gui Lang says goes.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.080
Besides,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.840
trafficking kids is wrong to begin with.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.320
Right!

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.279
You, of all people,

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:52.919
had to compete with Uncle Gui Lang's business.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.440
What a sin!

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.039
Yes.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:55.799
Exactly.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.320
Serves you right.

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.480
You still don't believe me.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.679
Master Fo.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.879
Uncle She.

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:04.919
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.440
Just say what you want me to do.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:09.279
In the end, this is your internal double-cross.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:10.279
You solve it yourselves.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.320
Just don't drag us into it.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.039
Listen to you.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:13.679
Gangzi.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.120
Though Old Street hasn't produced any great heroes,

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:19.720
it also can't harbor a trafficker.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:20.519
Right!

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.279
Shengzi.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.360
The trouble you caused five years ago

00:09:24.039 --> 00:09:27.120
cost our Old Street the coal mine.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.519
We didn't want you back.

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:29.840
You insisted on returning.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.679
You came back and started trafficking.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:36.440
Today you're up against Uncle Gui Lang.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.000
Tomorrow, I fear you'll be eating prison food.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.120
We elders have said

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.480
all we could, good and bad.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.080
You...

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.799
Gangzi.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.440
The people outside,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.519
you go deal with them yourself.

00:09:52.799 --> 00:09:54.440
Whether you lose an arm or a leg today,

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.600
live or die,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.679
our Old Street will not lift a finger to help you.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.759
That's right!

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:16.600
Master Fo

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:19.120
I respect you as an elder, so I call you Master Fo.

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:21.639
Back when you and Uncle She were in charge,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.320
the steel mill guys stole our turf.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.720
They bullied the girls from our Old Street.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.039
And you just told everyone to take it.

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.240
It was Shengzi.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.679
He charged into the steel mill alone,

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.039
and took down over a dozen guys.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.919
He was unconscious for three days.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:34.080
Have you all forgotten that?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Gangzi, stop talking.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.320
Shengzi.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.120
Let me speak.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.080
Master Fo.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.159
Let me ask you.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.399
If it weren't for Shengzi back then,

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.080
beating those steel mill thugs into submission,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
could you have lived in peace all these years?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.960
And now look.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:55.519
They've come knocking on our door.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.919
And you all hide inside your houses,

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:57.879
like a bunch of cowards.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.519
Leaving my brother to face it alone.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:00.960
Fine.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:02.840
If you won't help,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.200
we'll go ourselves.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.840
Look how cocky you are.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.200
You can't talk sense into a fool.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.440
If you want to go,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.159
go by yourself.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.200
Not a single neighbor will go with you.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.480
Cowards!

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.200
You...

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.919
Shengzi.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.799
Let's go.

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:21.799
Dad, I...

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.440
Later, we'll cripple Zhao Fengsheng.

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.679
That woman is yours tonight.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.600
Boss.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.399
They're here.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.120
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.840
You're a tough one to kill.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.720
I didn't come looking for you,

00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:52.000
and yet here you are,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.200
delivering yourself to die.

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:55.480
Not finishing you off was my mistake.

00:11:55.759 --> 00:11:57.799
You really piss me off.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.639
Not only did you cost me the incense trade,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.759
you made me lose face in the Ghost Face Hall.

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:04.519
How should we settle this score?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.440
Got scolded, huh?

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:06.600
You...

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:08.360
I'll curse Uncle Gui Lang for you a bit.

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:09.399
Help you vent.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.080
Enough with the trash talk.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.440
You jumped out today to defend Old Street,

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.039
but look at the whole Old Street.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.679
Not a single person came out to help you.

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:19.159
Isn't that pathetic?

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.080
You...

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:22.000
Me being so pathetic,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.879
isn't it all your fault?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.440
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.679
Don't come any closer!

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:37.080
Don't move.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.159
With your cowardly look,

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.360
you dare to surround Old Street?

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.120
You dare touch me,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.360
and your whole Old Street is finished.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.039
Uncle Gui Lang will raze your Old Street to the ground.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:44.919
Let go of me!

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.639
A waste like you isn't worth talking to.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.360
Call Uncle Gui Lang.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.559
I'll talk to him directly.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.279
What status does Uncle Gui Lang have?

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:52.720
What the hell are you?

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:54.279
Call Uncle Gui Lang.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.519
Uncle Gui Lang won't see you.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.759
You're just a hoodlum.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.559
Will you call or not?

00:12:57.879 --> 00:12:59.200
I'll call, I'll call.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.159
I'm calling.

00:13:07.559 --> 00:13:09.039
Is everything taken care of?

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.720
Sending such a useless guy here,

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.279
you must really look down on me, Zhao Fengsheng.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.159
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:19.559
Old Wolf.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.759
Shouldn't you pull your men back first?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.720
Guys like Wuya,

00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:25.519
I can find as many as I want.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.080
You don't think you can threaten me with this, do you?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.360
I'm not that stupid.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:30.399
That's why I'm talking to you.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.200
Do whatever you want with Wuya.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.759
But Old Street is mine.

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:37.840
Then what if I use the life you owe me

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.679
to trade for Old Street?

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:42.240
The life I owe you?

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.279
Amir.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.320
Luanshan Copper Mine.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.200
Who saved your life?

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.480
You...

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:52.919
You're from the Yunting Thirteen Guardians.
