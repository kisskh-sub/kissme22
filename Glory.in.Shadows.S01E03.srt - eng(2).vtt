00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.760
General

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.870
I, Yuzhu, have come
to attend to the General.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.350
General?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.310
I am here for you!

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.590
Is the General alone?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.920
General?

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.920
General?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.240
Who are you?

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.430
And who are you?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.880
And who are you then?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.760
I'm Tang Yuzhu, Second Concubine.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
I've just married in.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.350
Tell me, who am I?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.400
Madam.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.120
It was improper of me to overstep.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.710
You came in without my consent.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.510
You barged into my chamber uninvited

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.120
and disturbed my wedding
night with the General.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.560
What should we do?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.400
General, give the word.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.400
Have her sent away.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.950
Please don't, General!

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.430
Madam,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.560
I truly did not mean to disturb

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.430
you and the General.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.030
It was...

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.280
It was Lady Ruoyi.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.030
She said you even offended Old Madam.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.400
Who knew what trouble

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.190
you were planning to stir?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.120
I acted in haste for a moment.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.310
That is why I resorted
to this poor plan.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.560
Well,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.080
let me plead your case.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.960
Consider it a favor you owe me.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.990
Thank you, Madam.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840
General,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.840
perhaps we should just
let this matter rest.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.590
Thank you, General.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.630
You're quite clever,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.120
using me for favors.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.750
Driving a concubine out
on the wedding night

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.800
tarnishes both our reputations.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.520
I suppose that makes sense.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.410
Conduct wisely.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.270
General,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.200
you...

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.680
Are you leaving with her?

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.800
Since you want to work with me,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.680
you must show me your skills first.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.360
Tomorrow morning,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.120
I'll see how you handle it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.280
(This Shen Yaochu…)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.030
(She must have a story.)

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.310
General, didn't you go today

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.750
to make the Shen Family back down?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.120
Why change the plan all of a sudden?

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.240
I thought Madam Li would yield today.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.600
But unexpectedly…

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.080
Her place in her family is precarious.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.030
If I didn't let her in,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.800
she might not survive.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430
The Tang and Qin families
are already involved.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.310
No need to drag a helpless woman in.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.400
No…

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.520
She's not helpless.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.960
Old Madam.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.560
Why have you come at such a late hour?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
I heard that today,

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.310
Madam Li offended you, Old Madam.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.080
I truly have been worried.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.520
So I came to visit.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.590
You seem well-informed about the news.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.310
The Old Marquis has been
bedridden for three years.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.430
You've been managing
the household tirelessly.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.950
I deeply admire your devotion.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.520
Old Madam,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.920
you are the model for all
women in the household.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.630
What are you trying to say?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.430
I've heard about today's matter.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.720
It left me truly upset.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.510
Yaochu was arrogant and rude,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.800
and even dared to cross you.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.390
I cannot possibly endure such things.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.120
It's just a pity.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.720
I am but a concubine.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.720
While she is the rightful wife.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.720
My filial devotion is sincere.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.630
Yet I can't put it into action.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.390
Keep a closer watch for me.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.190
If she were to make a grave mistake
and be sent away from the household,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.160
then I could rest a little easier.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.070
I will be sure to stay vigilant.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.310
Old Madam, please rest assured.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.600
I shall take my leave now.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.920
Madam Li has come to greet Old Madam.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.560
The new wife, Yaochu,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.230
is here to greet

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.160
her mother-in-law.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.790
No hurry.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.310
You probably haven't met
these two before.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.600
Second Concubine, Yuzhu.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.390
Third Concubine, Ruoyi.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.240
Though you are the rightful wife,

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.190
you married in later than they did.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.840
From now on,

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.270
you must learn proper manners from them.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840
Yes.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.950
I have heard

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.750
that Jingchuan was in
your chambers yesterday.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.310
He stayed for barely an hour.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.600
Is this what happened?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.270
The General said he had
urgent matters at midnight

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.150
and then left.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.720
If you failed to attend
to the General well,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.800
and he departed displeased,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.560
Old Madam may not blame you,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.560
but matters of such weight

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.360
must never be met with falsehoods.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240
Why would I lie?

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.190
You know the reason deep down.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.000
Nanzhi.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.800
Old Madam, please see.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.310
On the wedding night, the bride
showed no sign of the first blood.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.600
How reckless you are!

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.630
You concealed your unworthy
past to marry into the family?

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.240
You clearly hold
no regard for our family.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.560
Yaochu,

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.390
how do you explain this matter?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.630
Explaining alone will do me no good.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.560
Please summon the General here.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.640
Things will be clear.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.390
Set the tea aside for now.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.240
Did I say you could rise?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.000
The General has arrived.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.310
Old Madam, why summon me?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.510
Last night was your wedding night.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.120
Yet no bridal mark was
found on Yaochu's cloth.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.630
Such a matter is a grave
offense in this house.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.630
Yet she insists on seeking you out.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.160
Tell me, why would that be?

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.520
- This...
- Jingchuan!

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.350
Xingwan?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.840
Jingchuan...

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.840
You're alive.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.750
Thank goodness, you survived.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.550
(Li Xingwan Daughter of Li Family)
I'd never see you again.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.400
Jingchuan...

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.470
- It's alright.
- Xingwan!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.390
Look what a state you are in!

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.560
I greet you, Mother.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.070
Didn't I send you to
Guanyin Nunnery to pray?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.960
What made you come back on your own?

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.600
This morning, I heard
my elder brother returned safely.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.960
I was overwhelmed with joy.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.440
So I couldn't hold back.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.550
I returned without

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.960
informing Mother.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.270
I ask for forgiveness.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.630
Enough.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.030
You are...

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.870
My sister-in-law?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.480
Sister-in-law, you've just married in,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.720
and Jingchuan returned.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.320
You truly are blessed.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.720
Xingwan, mind your manners.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.160
Go wait aside.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.280
Yaochu,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.200
I've already brought Jingchuan here.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.590
Let's hear it.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.240
How do you explain this?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.510
Old Madam, I actually…

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.110
What's wrong?

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.990
My legs feel numb

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.110
from kneeling.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.870
- Then stand up first.
- Hold on.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.670
Let her explain
the matter clearly first!

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.110
Last night…

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.120
It was my first meeting
with the General.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.360
We found ourselves in accord.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.630
The General knew I was gravely injured.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.630
He could not bear to see me suffer.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.720
Yet his feelings could
not be restrained.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.630
So, the General went out
in the middle of the night

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.670
for fear that overindulgence
might harm me.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.960
As for the Blood-stained cloth...

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.510
The General said…

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.480
It was our Token of Love.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480
He'd kept it to himself.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.590
So he took it.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.390
I have no idea

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.840
where Nanny Sun got this silk cloth.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.320
Why would she try to frame me?

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.160
I did no such thing!

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.150
I took it from your bed.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.510
Stop slandering me.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440
Jingchuan,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.200
is what Yaochu says true?

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:19.780
This…

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.720
To confirm it,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.720
take a look inside General's robes.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.910
See if that bloodstained
silk cloth is there.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.030
The General said he'd keep it close.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.200
General, you wouldn't lie, yes?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.510
So the General didn't lie to me.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.150
I'm deeply moved.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.270
Such a tainted thing.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.790
And you carry it with you?

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.080
What a misfortune.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.510
Quickly, throw it away.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.750
It's the Token of Love.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.080
I shall naturally keep it safe.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.870
Enough.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.870
This matter is settled.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.280
I'm exhausted.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.870
You may all leave.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.390
Wait.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.150
Nanny Sun tarnished my good name.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.120
She claimed I was impure.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.360
If it weren't for
the General's feelings for me

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.790
and keeping this piece of cloth,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.120
then today,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.600
Nanny Sun would have wronged me.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.600
That's not true!

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.510
Old Madam,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.560
General,

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.870
she accused me out of malice!

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.030
Are you implying

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.390
the General and I worked

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.630
together to frame you?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.320
No, no, that's not it.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.580
Old Madam,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.030
please, you must stand up for me!

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.000
That is enough.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.670
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.670
But this misunderstanding
nearly cost my life.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.240
We can't just let it slide
so easily, can we?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.910
Then what is it you want?

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.630
I've only just married in.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.080
I fear others will say

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.550
that I bully the servants.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.790
But if this isn't punished severely,

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.080
people will say
Old Madam can't keep order.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.110
In that case...

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.800
Nanny Sun,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.630
you will kneel here on the cushion

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.240
for ten full hours.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.710
Old Madam?

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.160
Old Madam!

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.630
Do it as she says.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.650
Old Madam!

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.440
You cannot turn your
back on me, Old Madam!

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.680
Sister-in-law.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.710
Nanny Sun...

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.650
Jingchuan.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.510
Kneel properly.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.270
If one day you can rise again,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.960
we shall meet once more.
