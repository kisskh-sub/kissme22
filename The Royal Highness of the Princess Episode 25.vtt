WEBVTT

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.000
Aren't you supposed to be in Yu Town?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
What brings you to my residence?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.520
Grand Tutor.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.000
The Third Prince of Yunze has surrounded the palace.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.800
I came for the command token.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.240
Only to go to the Western Camp.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.000
To mobilize troops and enter the palace to rescue His Majesty.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.159
Do you think I'm a three-year-old child?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.840
The Third Prince of Yunze died long ago.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.159
Don't you dare try to deceive me.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.120
I saw your treacherous intentions long ago.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.759
And now you've stolen the Golden Command Token.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
Now I'll grant you a swift death.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.000
It seems no matter what I say today,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.759
the Grand Tutor will not believe me.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.439
Seize him!

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.800
Wait! (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360
Shao Jue, what are you doing here?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.280
Father, this matter is suspicious.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.919
We should hear him out first.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.000
The Golden Command Token was bestowed by His Majesty.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.840
Stealing it is a capital offense.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.439
What else do you want?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.479
Seize him!

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.560
What are you doing?

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.919
Don't tell me you believe him?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.560
Because A Lan trusts him.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.919
Moreover, His Majesty suddenly fell ill and suspended court.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.560
No one is allowed to visit him.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.599
Don't you find that strange, Father?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.960
I will investigate this matter myself.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.680
But...

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.080
The crime he's committed now is punishable by death.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.319
I will absolutely not let him off lightly.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.680
Seize him!

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.879
What is the meaning of this?

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.759
If you want to kill him,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.919
then come at me.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.680
You... you're actually siding with an outsider

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.439
to threaten your own father?

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.800
You think I don't dare?

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.520
Get out of my way!

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.199
You get out of my way!

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.519
Take the master back to rest.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.519
Take good care of him.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.519
Yes.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.399
Tonight's events

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.279
must not be leaked, not a single word.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:58.199
Yes.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120
You stole this

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.240
to go to the Western Camp and mobilize troops to rescue His Majesty?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.120
Let's go.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.160
We've discovered the approximate location of the secret door's forbidden area.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.319
We'll find the entrance tomorrow.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.879
Why does the Grand Tutor still look so worried?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.920
I heard that tonight,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.000
His Highness accompanied the Fourth Princess in releasing sky lanterns in the palace.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.920
I've been thinking it over,

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.680
and it seems a bit suspicious.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.160
At this point,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.959
given the Fourth Princess's temperament,

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.160
why would she be willing to accompany His Highness in releasing sky lanterns?

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.160
His Highness admires the Fourth Princess.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.560
It's inevitable his judgment might be clouded.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.519
You mean...

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:08.120
Could there be something wrong with those sky lanterns?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.600
I'll go investigate.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.959
I wonder what poison Su Qi

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.680
has actually given Father.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You've been growing weaker these past two days.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.480
Don't worry.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.000
Using poison to control me

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.079
is more advantageous for him to control Yunmi.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:42.160
Therefore,

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:44.720
he won't be so quick to have me killed.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.199
It's just...

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.720
I wonder how Minister Yuwen is faring.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.279
Rest assured, Father.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.839
He will definitely come to rescue us.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.720
Don't overthink it.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.839
Get some proper rest first.

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.920
What did you say?

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.560
The sky lantern from last night was shot down.

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.600
We haven't yet found out who did it.

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.800
Impossible.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.120
A Zi wouldn't lie to me.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.040
Your Highness.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.519
Think about it carefully.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.839
Given the Fourth Princess's temperament,

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.360
how could she possibly with you...

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.839
I'll release this one myself.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.639
You make another one.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.120
Alright.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.600
The Fourth Princess had just released the sky lantern

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.439
when the other side shot it down.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.240
It's as if it was prearranged.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.560
The assassin sent to kill Yuwen Rui

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.120
confirmed he is dead.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:51.879
Our master suspects Yuwen Rui is not dead.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.079
Send people to investigate again thoroughly.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.279
Yes.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.959
Strengthen the palace defenses.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.319
Furthermore,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.160
in the Empress's name,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.480
invite the families of all military officers in the city

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:08.839
to the palace and place them under house arrest.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.720
Yes.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.679
Don't you have anything to say?

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:36.759
Since you already know,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.759
why should I say more?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.679
So,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.240
what you said last night...

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.039
was it true or not?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120
You said you still had feelings for me.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.159
You said we could start over.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:04.360
Was any of it true?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.320
Deliberately catering to me,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.879
step by step making me lower my guard,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.919
so you could send a message out, right?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.159
After using me,

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:38.159
you won't even pretend affection for one more moment?

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.399
Why not keep lying?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.799
Just lie to me for a lifetime.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.720
There's no need for that anymore.

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:54.639
You gave me hope,

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:56.360
only to let me down completely.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360
An Kezi!

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.159
Don't you think you're too cruel?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.879
Cruel?

00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:05.519
You deceived and hid things from me.

00:10:05.679 --> 00:10:06.879
You harmed my family.

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.039
You've caused me to lose my freedom now.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.279
Which of us is more cruel?

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:18.799
I was wrong.

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:21.759
I shouldn't have deluded myself

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.960
that we could still start over.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.919
Start over?

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.200
I wish I could kill you right now.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.480
Kill me?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.919
Fine.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.679
It was I who wronged you in the first place.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.840
I'll give you the chance right now.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.240
Stab right here.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.360
That way you can save your country,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.960
save your home,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960
and save your loved ones.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.919
Come on!

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:06.720
Stab!

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.200
Go on!

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.600
Didn't you want to kill me?

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:32.720
A Zi

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.639
In the end, you still couldn't bear it.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.360
Leave.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.000
Get out!

00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:07.720
In this lifetime,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.480
let us just torment each other.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.360
No need to be so tense.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.919
I merely

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.320
wanted to come have a drink with you.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.960
This is the secret passage into the palace.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.399
The poison my father took...

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:37.440
Don't worry.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.600
He'll be fine for now.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.080
Come.

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:45.679
Have a drink with your Seventh Cousin.

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:50.159
What?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.000
Now, you won't even have a drink

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.519
with your Seventh Cousin?

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:21.519
Now,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.279
of the people from the past,

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.679
perhaps only you are willing to drink with me.

00:14:34.679 --> 00:14:36.480
If I hadn't done all this,

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:39.559
you,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.240
Elder Brother,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.399
A Zi...

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.720
would you all still treat me the same?

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.679
In this world,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.600
there are no "ifs."

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.840
Yes.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.519
No "ifs."

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.679
When I became the real Su Qi again,

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.879
I was destined to lose you,

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:06.960
to lose Elder Brother,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.240
to lose A Zi.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.320
There was a moment when I thought,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.840
the former people of Yunze,

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.759
now have ample food and clothing,

00:15:19.799 --> 00:15:21.039
living and working in peace.

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.759
Could I let go of that national and family hatred?

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.159
But I am the Third Prince of Yunze.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.559
Some things

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.679
must be done.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.320
I originally thought

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.919
there was no hope for A Zi and me in this life.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.159
Just being able to keep her by my side was enough.

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:00.840
But later I discovered

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.519
people are never satisfied.

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.320
I wanted to start over with her.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.399
I wanted to see that I was still in her eyes.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.639
But just when I thought

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:17.639
we could be like before,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.320
I suddenly realized

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.559
everything was fake.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.679
It was all fake.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.759
A Lan,

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:32.919
tell me,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.799
why must Heaven treat me this way?

00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:41.080
At this point,

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.080
you and Royal Sister

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:51.960
are ultimately impossible together.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.359
Just like... just like a bird and a fish,

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.680
born to different paths,

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:09.960
unable to return together.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.680
Right?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.039
Your Highness!

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.079
Your Highness!

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.119
It's bad, Your Highness!

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.359
Yuwen Rui has led troops into the palace via the secret passage!

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.440
A Lan knew all along that Elder Brother wasn't dead.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.680
It was all your plan, right?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.240
Your Highness!

00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:44.799
Our men can't hold them off.

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:46.599
We should leave here quickly!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.960
Stand behind me.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.559
Elder Brother really isn't dead.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.279
It's been a few days,

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.480
and you've become the Third Prince of Yunze.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.759
Yes.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.640
Brothers for many years,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.039
yet now we must meet as enemies.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.880
You hid your identity all these years

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:13.519
just waiting for this day, weren't you?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.799
Back then, Yunmi broke faith

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.759
and sent troops to attack Yunze.

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:21.799
Now I'm just repaying in kind.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.440
Back then...

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.240
Father...

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.920
Your Majesty!

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.759
If it weren't for your father back then

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:40.680
sending assassins to kill me first,

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:43.960
why would I have sent troops to attack Yunze?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.200
My father was diligent and loved his people.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.400
He didn't want to be drawn into the struggle for power.

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:49.279
He voluntarily offered

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:51.039
the treasure map, originally belonging to Yunze, to you.

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.200
And now,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.039
you actually slander my father, saying he wanted to assassinate you?

00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:58.640
It's truly laughable.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.359
He used the opportunity of presenting the map to assassinate me!

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:03.039
Father...

00:20:03.799 --> 00:20:04.559
Back then,

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:07.559
he arranged with me to present the map at Qiyun Mountain.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.799
But after I left Qiyun Mountain,

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:11.640
I was ambushed.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:15.279
Prince Ning finally captured a group of assassins.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.799
All were Yunze death warriors.

00:20:21.559 --> 00:20:22.480
The victor is king, the loser a bandit.

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:24.799
Now, I have no need to argue with you.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.720
Father...

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.240
You just said

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.359
it was Prince Ning who caught those assassins.

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:36.640
Now that Prince Ning has woken up,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.759
why not have him come here

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.519
and tell us what really happened back then?

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:50.200
Stop!

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.000
Young Master Meng!

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.599
Lord Yuwen has taken men to Renzin Hall.

00:20:58.599 --> 00:20:59.480
We'll go rescue the others.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.079
They're imprisoned in Liuyun Hall.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:01.839
Follow me.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.119
Royal Brother, save me!

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.640
Royal Brother, save me!

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.079
Royal Brother, save me! Royal Brother!

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.599
Royal Brother, save me!

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:20.400
The ambush on His Majesty at Qiyun Mountain...

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.119
You were the one who caught the assassins.

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:25.599
Yes.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.559
Were the assassins really sent by the Yunze Emperor?

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:36.839
Tell the truth.

00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:43.200
You won't talk?

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.599
Then tell it to the King of Hell.

00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:45.920
I'll talk! I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.960
I'll tell you everything!

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160
Those death warriors...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.799
Actually,

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.960
they weren't actually sent by the Yunze Emperor.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.119
What did you say?

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.359
You...

00:21:57.759 --> 00:21:59.240
Not sent by the Yunze Emperor?

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.960
Then it was you who arranged it.

00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:03.160
You sent people to assassinate my father

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:05.720
just to seize the Map of the Nine Provinces.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.640
Right?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.240
Sending people to assassinate my parents...

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.720
is also related to this, isn't it?

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:16.599
That is

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.319
They have discovered my scheme.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.200
And Ru Feng.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.960
I was wrong.

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:24.400
I know I was wrong.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480
Spare my life.

00:22:25.799 --> 00:22:26.400
Imperial Brother.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.839
Imperial Brother, save me!

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:30.960
Imperial Brother, spare my life, Imperial Brother!

00:22:31.079 --> 00:22:32.920
Imperial Brother, I know I was wrong.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.920
Save me, Imperial Brother!

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.000
Spare you?

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:39.000
Your assassination failed.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.160
You framed my father.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.480
Leading to the fall of my Yunze.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.359
And now you still dream of living?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.839
My Yunze perished because of you.

00:22:48.079 --> 00:22:49.480
You deserve to die ten thousand deaths.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.920
Your Highness.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.480
The map and key are secured.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.400
Deciphering the map's secret is crucial.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.440
Perhaps we should find a way to retreat first.

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:16.440
The map and key...

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:17.799
Your Highness.

00:23:18.079 --> 00:23:19.680
Do not worry about this old man.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:21.720
Go, quickly!

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.079
Yunze cannot afford to lose another loyal subject.

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:32.480
I dare not claim the title of 'loyal subject.'

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920
In Yunmi...

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.960
I have been here for many years.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.839
I served the Emperor for decades.

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:42.880
The Emperor treated me well.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.480
Yet I poisoned his wine.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.480
As for Yunze...

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.759
I watched helplessly as it fell.

00:23:50.759 --> 00:23:52.200
Powerless to stop it.

00:23:52.759 --> 00:23:53.640
Now...

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:57.440
Your Highness must save a useless man like me.

00:23:58.319 --> 00:23:59.400
Your Highness.

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:03.039
I am an old man now.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:07.880
It is time for me to go.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:13.680
Grand Tutor Guan!

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:15.680
Grand Tutor Guan!

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.240
This...

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.839
Fortunately, I came prepared.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:34.559
Princess.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.640
Are you sure about altering the Dragon Throne?

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.599
Of course.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.160
Father already knows.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.400
Just do as I say.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.759
A Lan.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:55.960
My apologies.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.960
Do not harm A Lan.

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:02.559
Let us leave.

00:25:06.079 --> 00:25:07.039
Let them go.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880
Let them leave.

00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:13.119
Everyone, step aside!

00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:14.519
Do not harm A Lan.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.119
A Lan.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:18.200
A Lan.

00:25:21.559 --> 00:25:22.559
Don't be afraid, A Lan.

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.480
Protect His Majesty.

00:25:44.319 --> 00:25:45.200
Yes.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.519
Your Highness.

00:26:01.599 --> 00:26:03.440
This is the entrance to the Hidden Gate's sanctuary.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.599
This... Your Highness.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.839
Who is this person?

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.000
Only the Hidden Gate's leader knows of this place.

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:39.599
He might be the leader.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.720
Your Highness.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.400
The secret of the Nine Provinces Map...

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:02.279
Could it be inside the brocade box?

00:28:11.599 --> 00:28:12.359
Su Qi.

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:18.079
Elder Brother, you arrived quite quickly.

00:28:25.279 --> 00:28:26.160
Open it.

00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:39.720
I am the leader of the Hidden Gate.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.599
You have found this place.

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:44.319
Surely for the secret of the Nine Provinces Map.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.759
The secret of this map...

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.279
Is known only to me and the Yunze Emperor.

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.319
A lifetime of regret.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:54.119
I now reveal the map's secret to the world.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.440
Your Highness.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.359
The Hidden Gate leader left a letter.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.839
It reveals the secret of the Nine Provinces Map.

00:29:06.359 --> 00:29:07.680
A thousand years ago...

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.000
The Nine Provinces continent was in chaos.

00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:14.359
Rumors said the Nine Provinces Map...

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.519
Held the secret to unifying the realm.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.960
The world believed this without doubt.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.640
To vie for supremacy...

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.680
The Yunze Emperor and I conspired.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:25.480
We pretended to find the treasure map.

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:27.000
And presented it to Yunmi.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.119
When nations vied for the treasure...

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:31.799
They would inevitably wage war for the map.

00:29:32.359 --> 00:29:34.279
Once the nations were weakened...

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.960
My Yunze could reap the benefits.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.440
Unexpectedly, an accident occurred during the presentation.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:44.799
War erupted everywhere.

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:46.400
The Hidden Gate declined.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.400
I saw countless people displaced.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.680
Their families destroyed.

00:29:52.279 --> 00:29:54.160
My heart filled with immense regret.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.680
I no longer have the face to live on.

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:02.559
There is no such thing...

00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.559
As a treasure map that grants the world.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.640
All of this was merely...

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.720
A conspiracy between me and the Yunze Emperor.

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.480
Impossible.

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:19.160
Impossible!

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:22.200
This map... it's a forgery.

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:22.799
This...

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:26.279
How is this possible?

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.359
I searched for this map for so long.

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:44.039
How could it be fake?

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.880
Father loved his people like his children.

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:48.920
He only wished for peace in the realm.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.839
How could he deliberately release a fake map...

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:51.960
To incite conflict across the land?

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.039
Impossible.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.599
Impossible!

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.799
The truth about the fake map must not be told to others.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.680
This might be...

00:31:14.359 --> 00:31:16.640
A secret letter from the Yunze Emperor to the Hidden Gate leader.

00:31:24.519 --> 00:31:25.240
Your Highness.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.680
This is His Majesty's handwriting.

00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:02.599
To think all these years...

00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:04.960
I schemed in secret.

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:08.079
Exhausted all my cunning.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.240
Only to find out...

00:32:12.759 --> 00:32:15.799
It was just a fake map created by Father.

00:32:30.559 --> 00:32:31.559
Father...

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:35.599
As you predicted...

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:38.440
The treasure map emerged.

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:40.400
Nations fought.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.400
War raged on.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.839
And what about me?

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.000
I meticulously became Yuwen Xiu.

00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:53.680
In the end...

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.839
It was all just a joke.

00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:15.839
You took the brocade box and triggered the tomb's mechanism.

00:33:16.039 --> 00:33:16.640
Get out!

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:17.240
Go!

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:20.440
Your Highness.

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.759
Please leave this place, Your Highness.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.480
You go.

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:24.559
Your Highness.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.200
This old minister cannot abandon you.

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:30.119
Your Highness.

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.079
Hurry and go.

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:34.640
Your Highness.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.240
Zixiu, go quickly!

00:33:37.359 --> 00:33:38.519
Your Highness.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.319
This medicine can cure the Yunmi Emperor's poison.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.720
Your Highness.

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:50.319
Your Highness.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.200
Are you hurt?

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.799
No.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.319
Elder Sister.

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:07.119
Where is Su Qi?

00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:13.199
Inside the Hidden Gate's forbidden chamber...

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.599
...lies the confession letter of the Hidden Gate's leader.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.119
There never was any treasure map in this world.

00:34:19.559 --> 00:34:20.880
It was all just a scheme by the Yunze Emperor...

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.559
...to stir up conflict across the land.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.760
When the forbidden chamber collapsed...

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.199
Su Qi, he...

00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.159
He didn't want to come out.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.719
A Zi.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.719
Seventh Cousin.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:08.960
A Zi.

00:35:10.079 --> 00:35:11.400
Every year on the Qixi Festival...

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.840
...you'll stay by my side.

00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:21.440
This is the happiest moment...

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:23.920
...of my entire life.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.760
A Zi.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.880
I will never let you go.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.760
Your Highness.

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:28.440
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:29.719
Go.

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:32.000
Go on!

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.960
Why did you save me?

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.440
If it were you...

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:48.000
...you wouldn't just watch us die either.

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:02.880
Go.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.519
Tell your father, the Emperor...

00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:14.199
...that I perished in the Hidden Gate's forbidden chamber.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.159
From now on...

00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:19.199
...there will be no Third Prince of Yunze in this world.

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:26.639
Tell A Zi...

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.480
...the same thing.

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:31.519
But, Elder Sister...

00:37:51.239 --> 00:37:53.079
Your Highness, let's go.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.519
Let's go, Your Highness.
