WEBVTT

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.079
Speak.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
What exactly is going on?

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.799
You dare touch Brother Xiaobei?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.880
Don't play dumb with this lady.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.880
Think the Four Pests of the Old Street are pushovers?

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.520
Come back.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.240
If you don't explain clearly today,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.399
This lady will rip your leg off.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.200
Auntie.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:04.000
Auntie.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.560
Speak.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.079
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.920
Speak up, quick.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.280
I'll talk, I'll talk.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.760
Zhao Fengsheng isn't coming back.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.519
What do you mean?

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.359
Laochong.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.719
Who is this?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.640
Here to see Wuya about drugs.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.480
Wait here.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.280
Wuya is busy with a woman again.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.959
Did I say you could get dressed?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480
I've had my fun.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.359
The brothers haven't had a taste yet.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.719
Wuya.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040
Please spare me this one time.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.840
Wuya.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.920
You even messed up hooking up with a bathhouse thug.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.239
How can I spare you?

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.519
Wuya.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.319
There's a thug outside saying he wants to score drugs.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:58.680
Thug?

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.959
Let's go, let's go.

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:02.599
Move.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.840
Move.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.319
Move.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.000
Behave yourself.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.319
Let me go.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.439
You came to the right place finding Wuya for this.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.479
Let me go.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.199
Don't move.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.159
Zhou Xiaoman.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.000
Brother Shengzi.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.439
Help me, Brother Shengzi.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.159
Get lost.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.479
Who the hell are you?

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.080
Who is it?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.560
Wuya.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.800
You really don't know how to treat a lady.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.520
What?

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.120
Haven't seen you in five years.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.800
Don't recognize your grandpa?

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.400
Madman Zhao.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.960
You can't save the Old Street Coal Mine.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.080
Get out of Old Street.

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.800
I'll let your brothers go.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.400
I can leave.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.520
But a promise is a promise.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.240
You, Wuya, must keep your word too.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.319
It's that kid from Old Street.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.479
This kid is really like a leech.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.360
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.319
Not senile and blind yet, huh?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.439
I was just waiting for you.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.800
You actually dare to show up.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:29.840
I know these guys.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.039
Aren't they just the little punks from five years ago?

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.000
Wuya.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.719
You haven't improved much, have you?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.039
Five years no see.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.240
Haven't seen your skills grow.

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.680
But your mouth sure has.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.039
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.400
Where have you been these five years?

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.639
How did you get so good at fighting?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.199
Where are the children you kidnapped from Old Street?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.280
This drug business belongs to Uncle Gui Lang.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.080
How many lives do you have, Zhao Fengsheng?

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.000
To dare offend the underground emperor of Bianshui.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.759
Alright.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.240
Then I'll go meet this so-called...

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.439
Underground emperor.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.399
Good.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.120
Then let's see.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.040
If you'll still be alive by then.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.240
Xiaoxiao.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.160
Why the hell are you still sleeping here?

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.120
Didn't you hear people fighting outside?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.240
If you want to know where your sister is,

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.920
Go kill the people outside for me.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:05.879
Do you understand?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.560
If you lie to me again,

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.399
I'll kill you.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.560
Painted Face.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.720
Brother.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.279
You're with Wuya now?

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.439
Brother.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.199
I had no choice.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.639
Go.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.040
Let me go.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.360
Hurry up.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.720
Brother Shengzi.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.600
Go.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.040
Save me.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.279
Move faster.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.079
Brother Shengzi.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.000
Brother.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.800
Wuya set a trap to catch you.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:57.680
Run, quick.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.839
Xiaoqian is in their hands.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.519
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.600
You think today I...

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.120
...will let you all get out alive?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
You all have to die today.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.160
Come with me.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.519
I...

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:36.279
Shengzi.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.240
There are explosives!

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.240
Shengzi.

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:45.639
Yaqing.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.519
Yaqing.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.560
Shengzi.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.480
Yaqing.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.240
The dead cannot come back to life.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.000
The dead cannot come back to life, Yaqing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.120
You're the one who's dead!

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.000
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.279
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.879
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:09.439
You jerk.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.480
Er Ni.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.600
Stop crying.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.360
Shengzi.

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:57.480
I thought you were dead.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.040
Xiaoxiao.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.720
I'm cold.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:05.000
Little brat.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:06.879
Hold on a little longer.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.120
Uncle Hen will get you to the hospital right away.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.000
Bai.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.319
Bai Yuchen has a car.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.680
We'll take his car.

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:14.680
Go.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.959
You guys go first.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.720
Have you seen Painted Face?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.040
Painted Face!

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:24.160
Is Painted Face here?

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.519
Painted Face!

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:26.759
Painted Face!

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:28.759
Painted Face!

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.920
Shengzi!

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.320
Painted Face!

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.519
Painted Face!

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.519
Painted Face!

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.240
Painted Face, where are you?

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.720
Painted Face!

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.120
Painted Face!

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.919
Painted Face!

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.000
Brother.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.720
I'm sorry.

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:50.159
Painted Face, where are you?

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.279
Painted Face!

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.759
Painted Face!

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.000
Painted Face!

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.000
Dafo!

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:02.000
Don't be stupid.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.000
How could Shengzi kidnap Xiaoxiao?

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:06.080
Xiaobei saw it with his own eyes.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.120
Still trying to deny it?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.120
We searched all night last night.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:11.720
Zhao Fengsheng never came back.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.159
If he didn't kidnap the kid,

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.159
why would he be so guilty?

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.440
Why would he do that?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.759
You're just guessing wildly.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.039
Can't you just wait for Shengzi to come back

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:19.879
and hear what he has to say?

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.840
I don't want to hear you defend him.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.279
If he dares touch my son,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.679
I'll dare to end him.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.080
I'll bulldoze his house.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.039
Dig up his ancestors' graves.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.000
Dafo!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.000
How is your brain

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.320
even worse than mine?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.159
What?

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:33.679
Want to fight, huh?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.559
You think I'm scared of you?

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:36.000
Come on!

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.360
Come on!

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:42.840
Hello?

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.919
It's me.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.440
Okay.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.519
Xiaoxiao!

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:51.200
Xiaoxiao, my Xiaoxiao!

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.320
Xiaoxiao!

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.279
Xiaoxiao!

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:00.320
Xiaoxiao!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.720
Old Buddha!

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.240
Aunt Feng!

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:01.799
This, this, this...

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:02.399
Quick!

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:03.759
Xiaoxiao!

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.600
Bai Yuchen?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.159
What are you doing here?

00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:06.879
Where's Xiaoxiao?

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.919
I went through a lot of trouble

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.559
calling in favors to get Xiaoxiao rescued.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:11.000
Hurry to room 103.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:11.759
Thank you.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:12.840
Thank you so much.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.559
Thanks.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:15.279
You say you rescued Xiaoxiao?

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.519
Yes.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.480
I heard the child was missing,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.559
so I sent out all my people and friends

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.879
to search everywhere.

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:22.440
Luckily, heaven rewards the diligent.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.440
That's strange.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.360
Where's Shengzi?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.679
Your son has isopropanol poisoning.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.759
Fortunately, he was brought in time

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.840
to save his life.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.600
What?

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:34.720
Poisoning?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.200
Who poisoned him?

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:37.279
Family members.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.000
This is a hospital room.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.879
No loud noises.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.039
Xiaoxiao.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.720
What happened?

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:43.720
Xiaoxiao.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.159
Still smiling?

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:45.679
He's fine.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.919
Remind him to get plenty of rest.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:47.320
Slow down.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.240
Don't run around.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.120
Remember that.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.200
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:53.559
Did you hear that?

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.080
He told you not to run around.

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:58.559
I haven't been able to catch up with you since you got back.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.720
Stop that.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.919
Shengzi.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.200
What happened here?

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.080
Wuya tried to blow up Shengzi.

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.080
Then why didn't you call me?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.559
Don't you see me as a brother?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720
It happened so suddenly.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.000
Who had time to call you?

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.840
It's fine. I'm still alive, aren't I?

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.879
Did you see Xiaoxiao?

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:22.559
At the hospital.

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.000
Dafo and the others were just here.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:27.080
Does the wound hurt?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.000
It hurts.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.399
Then get me two old hens to comfort me.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.440
Still joking around.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.279
Stop messing around.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.039
Calm down.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.120
Here.

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.399
This is for women.

00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:44.320
Why should I drink this?

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.080
It replenishes your energy.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.879
Hurry up.

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:46.960
Stop with the supplements.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.399
Don't make this lady lose her temper.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.279
Hurry.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.000
I won't drink it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.240
Finish it.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.120
Good boy.

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:00.600
Yaqing.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.799
Tianyu.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.399
What brings you here?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.559
The dean of this hospital wants to curry favor with my dad.

00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:08.519
Who are you feeding?

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:10.679
This is Shengzi.

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:15.360
So you're Zhao Fengsheng.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.120
Shengzi.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.200
This is my good friend, Qian Tianyu.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:22.159
In all my life,

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:23.120
I've never seen someone

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.840
so lacking in self-awareness.

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:25.919
Haven't you looked in the mirror?

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:26.639
Look at yourself.

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.200
Do you think you're worthy of our Yaqing?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.840
Let me tell you,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.720
stay away from her from now on.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.519
Do you hear me?

00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:31.960
Tianyu.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.159
Yaqing.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.159
Don't be fooled by this big toad.

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:36.759
How dare you talk like that, woman?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.360
Gangzi.

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:41.000
She's Er Ni's friend.

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:42.559
Don't ruin the peace.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.919
Let's go see Xiaoxiao.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:44.759
Later,

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:48.240
we'll make Old Buddha's family host an apology banquet.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.080
Slow down.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.240
It's fine.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.759
Tianyu.

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:56.000
Let me show you

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.679
how Shengzi tames the neighbors.

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:58.320
Let's go.
