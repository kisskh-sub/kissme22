WEBVTT

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:54.450
How did you get here?

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:56.870
Were you checking up on me?

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:03.001
What about you?
I was so worried about you,

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:05.336
and you were here, like this?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.462
Since when?

00:01:06.546 --> 00:01:10.049
I told you already.
Don't come near me again.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.342
Answer me first!

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:13.887
How long have you been here
with that woman?!

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.346
Why does that matter?

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:19.142
We were over a long time ago.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:22.478
-You can't just show up like this--
-We never broke up.

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:25.356
How…

00:01:26.274 --> 00:01:27.650
How could we ever be over?

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.157
Back then, I was too scared.

00:01:35.408 --> 00:01:37.702
I thought letting you go was the only way.

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:41.039
So you could be happy.

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:44.208
But things changed.

00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:45.585
You're hurting so much now.

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:49.547
You need me.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.052
No.

00:01:56.054 --> 00:01:57.222
No, I don't.

00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:00.350
When you left me, you said

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:04.354
I ruined your life.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.272
You were right.

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:08.691
You can't make that same mistake.

00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:13.196
-La-ik, that's not--
-Right now, I don't need help.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.406
I don't need your care.

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.535
So leave me alone.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:21.913
Please.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:24.499
Then what about her?

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:28.378
What is she to you?

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.675
Why are you keeping her by your side?

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.346
She's the only one I can trust right now.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:46.187
After we ended that way,
I struggled a lot.

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.692
So I tried treatment, meds, everything…

00:02:52.193 --> 00:02:53.903
but nothing worked.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:59.117
But lately, I've been off my meds.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.578
Even after losing Woo-seong,
even when it almost killed me…

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.457
I'm still standing,

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.501
thanks to her.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.380
So if you do care about me…

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:16.342
don't ever show up in front of me again.

00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:46.289
I'm sorry.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.667
You don't have to worry anymore.

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.476
Why did you act like you didn't know?

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:09.020
You knew everything. Why?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.106
Was it fun?

00:04:12.774 --> 00:04:14.776
Knowing everything
I'd done behind your back,

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.653
pretending you didn't,
acting like you cared about my feelings.

00:04:20.365 --> 00:04:21.741
It must have been fun for you.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:29.290
I tried to protect you.

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:32.627
What?

00:04:36.714 --> 00:04:38.591
Both of us.

00:04:39.675 --> 00:04:43.805
If that article came out,
your family would never let this slide.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:47.683
I couldn't ruin your life
over something like that.

00:04:48.393 --> 00:04:50.019
Ruin my life?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.982
You already did.

00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:00.446
I ended up being like this
all because of you.

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:03.616
You abandoned me!

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.035
You ignored me and left me alone!

00:05:11.624 --> 00:05:13.668
Right. You're right.

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.754
This is all my fault.

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:20.425
I'm sorry.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:23.094
I'll walk away. If that's what you want…

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.350
Walk away?

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:31.644
And what would you be then?

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:35.731
Don't flatter yourself.
You're nothing to me.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:40.820
I gave you a little attention
and you thought you were someone?

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:44.532
You were a kid dragging debt

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:47.451
behind a gambling addict mom,
performing in shabby venues.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.912
Got famous and now you think
you're special?

00:05:51.497 --> 00:05:53.166
Why would you say it like that?

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.668
You could just say you're sorry!

00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:58.421
Why should I be sorry? You should be!

00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:04.468
I was here the whole time!

00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:06.762
You acted like I didn't exist.

00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:09.640
You lied to the world about me!

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:26.324
Was I really…

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.493
nothing to you?

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:34.874
Hye-joo, please.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.048
Can't you see me?
The real me, not the shell.

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:44.258
Can't you love me that way?

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:48.429
And what is there…

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.100
besides that shell?

00:07:10.993 --> 00:07:12.578
Mr. Nam,

00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:16.165
did you look into the lawyer I mentioned?

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:17.917
We're in contact with Yultae.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.961
We should be able to wrap it up soon.

00:07:20.044 --> 00:07:22.421
Make sure they've got
over ten years on the bench.

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:26.676
And La-ik's house,
it's under seizure, right?

00:07:28.261 --> 00:07:29.929
Check the debt too.

00:07:30.012 --> 00:07:31.222
Yes.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.295
Attorney Maeng?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.005
You awake?

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:56.057
You said it'd help
tomorrow's interrogation,

00:08:56.974 --> 00:08:58.643
so I wrote down people around me.

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:02.855
I'll leave it here.

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:23.334
You were startled earlier?

00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:28.673
Sorry.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:31.384
I don't know why,

00:09:31.467 --> 00:09:34.136
but I fall apart around you.

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:40.309
But I guess I really have no shame.

00:09:41.644 --> 00:09:44.063
Inside this fence you built for me,

00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.233
I feel lighter than I have in a long time.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.028
So I want to stay a little longer.

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:55.491
I know it must be exhausting for you
to defend someone like me,

00:09:57.159 --> 00:10:00.746
but I'll try my best too.

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:37.908
DO LA-IK'S RELATIONSHIP CHART

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.496
HONG HYE-JOO, NOT RELATED.

00:10:53.424 --> 00:10:55.468
Anyway, remember three things.

00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:58.971
First, don't get defensive when responding
to Choi Jae-hee's statement.

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:01.348
Just answer what you know.

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:02.266
Second,

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:05.978
if you don't understand a question,
ask what it means first.

00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:09.523
What? Did you buy a new car?

00:11:09.607 --> 00:11:11.609
No. It's just a rental for now.

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:14.069
You sure you can drive?
Do you want me to do it?

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:15.988
I'm fine. I can handle it.

00:11:22.203 --> 00:11:24.580
-You're really okay?
-Yes.

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:26.624
And lastly, the most important part.

00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:31.003
Since he's close to you,
it might be emotionally difficult.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:33.297
No matter what he says,

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.049
don't lose your temper.

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:37.218
Come on, what would I get upset about?

00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:40.346
Don't worry.
There's no way that'll happen.

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:43.849
Hey! Stop lying!

00:11:44.725 --> 00:11:47.311
See? He was always like this.

00:11:48.145 --> 00:11:50.940
With Woo-seong, he'd blow up like that
and pick fights all the time.

00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:54.527
-They even got physical more than once.
-When did I ever!

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:59.031
So he frequently had conflicts
with Kang Woo-seong?

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:02.284
Yeah. He was a tyrant.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.037
He'd threaten Woo-seong,
saying he'd kill him.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.413
That's a biased claim.

00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:10.334
And the witness already
has a history of lying about his alibi.

00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:11.919
This is a one-sided statement

00:12:12.002 --> 00:12:15.089
-with zero credibility--
-We're saying it because we have evidence.

00:12:18.842 --> 00:12:20.094
Mr. Do La-ik?

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:23.722
I heard you had contract issues
with Goldie Entertainment.

00:12:24.807 --> 00:12:26.767
According to Choi Jae-hee,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.769
you were preparing to quit the group.

00:12:29.728 --> 00:12:32.606
Wow… You still believe that trash rumor?

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.732
It's not a rumor.

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:36.902
I heard it myself.

00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:39.029
What?

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.614
That day, Woo-seong found out

00:12:40.698 --> 00:12:43.742
this jerk was planning to leave Gold Boys.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:47.871
He knew he'd already been talking
to another agency.

00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:49.331
He went to stop him.

00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:51.834
What are you… Jae-hee.

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:53.544
Please, stop lying.

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:55.629
You stop lying!

00:12:55.713 --> 00:12:57.131
That day…

00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:06.890
Here.

00:13:11.604 --> 00:13:14.106
Why is that psycho
so obsessed with me all the time!

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:15.608
He never did that.

00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.526
He cares about you so much.

00:13:19.153 --> 00:13:20.237
Cares?

00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:23.115
Someone who cares doesn't sneak around.

00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:25.284
He already signed

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:29.622
a secret solo deal with another company.

00:13:29.705 --> 00:13:33.208
That's why our comeback was canceled,
and he released his solo.

00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:35.669
He wants one big score before running.

00:13:36.503 --> 00:13:37.921
Where did you hear that?

00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:42.718
My friend works
in the support team of that company.

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:46.263
It is confirmed.
He already took a huge advance.

00:13:46.347 --> 00:13:49.642
I'm going to leak this
to the press tomorrow.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:51.852
This is straight-up tampering.

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:54.605
-Once this comes out, he's finished.
-No.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:56.357
What?

00:13:57.983 --> 00:13:59.401
It is not confirmed yet.

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:02.905
I'll talk to La-ik tomorrow
and check it myself.

00:14:02.988 --> 00:14:05.908
So don't tell anyone until then. Got it?

00:14:11.747 --> 00:14:12.790
What are you doing, guys?

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:15.876
What are you talking about?

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:17.211
Nothing.

00:14:17.294 --> 00:14:20.839
He went to meet that jerk…

00:14:22.174 --> 00:14:23.550
and he ended up like that.

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:28.555
He definitely killed him!

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.684
If everything he was scheming came out,

00:14:31.767 --> 00:14:33.560
his life would've been over,
so he took out…

00:14:33.644 --> 00:14:35.020
No.

00:14:35.104 --> 00:14:37.856
No. I never killed him.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.566
Do Mi-gyeong is your mother, right?

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:44.947
We checked the transfer
of the advance payment to her account.

00:14:45.864 --> 00:14:48.367
You used her account

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.369
so it would not trace back to you?

00:15:21.108 --> 00:15:23.944
I will find out what happened.

00:15:24.778 --> 00:15:25.738
Do you know…

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.451
where my mom is right now?

00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:34.413
INTERROGATION ROOM

00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:43.714
Thank you for your time.

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:47.968
We may question you again later,
so keep that in mind.

00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:51.638
-This way.
-Wait a moment, please.

00:15:51.722 --> 00:15:53.807
You're questioning me again?

00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:56.518
Why? I already told you everything.

00:15:56.602 --> 00:16:00.522
What you say and what we judge
are different.

00:16:00.606 --> 00:16:03.317
You said as long as I gave my statement,
I'd be in the clear.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.444
That's why I told you the tampering,

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.654
and said that La-ik is the culprit.
So why now?

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:08.739
Mr. Choi…

00:16:08.822 --> 00:16:13.327
Giving a statement does not free you
from legal responsibility.

00:16:14.119 --> 00:16:16.830
Of course, what you testified about him

00:16:16.914 --> 00:16:18.916
can be taken into consideration.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:21.335
But that doesn't mean
it grants you immunity.

00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:24.088
Aren't you changing your words
a little too much?

00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:26.173
You're the one changing your words.

00:16:26.256 --> 00:16:30.010
You admitted your alibi was a lie.

00:16:31.553 --> 00:16:34.098
The truth is always relative.

00:16:34.723 --> 00:16:36.725
There's no such thing as absolute truth.

00:16:36.809 --> 00:16:38.519
It changes depending

00:16:38.602 --> 00:16:40.687
on how you look at it.

00:16:42.397 --> 00:16:45.234
And depending on how I see you,

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:49.822
the whole situation
can look very different.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.324
So be careful.

00:16:53.492 --> 00:16:55.619
Cooperating fully with the investigation

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.539
will be better for you.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.258
Are you okay? Let's go.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.314
Jae-hee.

00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:32.698
Why can't I win?

00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:40.706
Damn it.

00:17:42.958 --> 00:17:44.376
Hey!

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.755
Let go!

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:50.966
It was just starting to hit.

00:17:53.927 --> 00:17:55.596
How are you still living like this?

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.432
Do you know
how hard it is to get a machine that hits?

00:17:58.515 --> 00:18:02.227
And it's still nothing compared
to the money you made using my name.

00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:03.228
Isn't it?

00:18:04.938 --> 00:18:06.315
Be honest.

00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:08.275
Did you sign with another company
under my name?

00:18:09.484 --> 00:18:11.153
Did you?!

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:13.447
Fine, I took some money!

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.034
I made that name for you,
why can't I use it?

00:18:17.117 --> 00:18:19.703
What, should I starve to death instead?

00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.206
Is that what you should say?

00:18:22.998 --> 00:18:26.543
Because of that,
your son became a murder suspect.

00:18:28.086 --> 00:18:29.588
And you act like nothing happened?

00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:33.425
I am sad, so sad!

00:18:33.508 --> 00:18:36.970
How did my son become someone so vicious?

00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:38.805
Because of you,

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:41.433
I had to go to the prosecutor's office
to be questioned!

00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:43.101
Do you know how much I cried?

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:45.938
The prosecutor told me,

00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:48.273
if you turn yourself in now,
you'll only serve ten years…

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.361
How could you…

00:18:53.153 --> 00:18:55.072
How could you not trust me!

00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.827
During your questioning,

00:19:00.911 --> 00:19:03.580
did you also mention
which company you signed with?

00:19:04.373 --> 00:19:07.125
You must not reveal
anything from the questioning.

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:10.754
If it leaks,

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:13.340
you may be charged
with breaking confidentiality.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.805
Then what happens to my son?

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.641
Since he was drunk, and if we charge this

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:27.813
as an unplanned, impulsive killing,
his sentence will be around ten years.

00:19:27.896 --> 00:19:30.691
That is only if he turns himself in now.

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:36.154
The longer he drags this out,
the higher the sentence

00:19:36.238 --> 00:19:39.992
I'll be seeking.

00:19:45.998 --> 00:19:47.624
I don't know.

00:19:47.708 --> 00:19:49.918
I left the contract and card somewhere.

00:19:50.544 --> 00:19:53.463
I can't find them.

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.090
Then what about a phone number?

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:58.260
If you got paid,
you must have their contact.

00:19:58.343 --> 00:20:01.680
I don't have that either.
I changed my phone recently.

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:05.017
Look, if you are a lawyer,

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.269
don't let my son push you around.

00:20:07.352 --> 00:20:09.730
Convince him to turn himself in. Please.

00:20:11.898 --> 00:20:13.317
Go.

00:20:14.443 --> 00:20:16.111
It's over. Go.

00:20:17.529 --> 00:20:19.323
Go. Just go now!

00:20:55.025 --> 00:20:55.984
Where are we going?

00:20:57.361 --> 00:20:59.488
To the place you want to go the most.

00:21:15.212 --> 00:21:17.547
Where are we going?

00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:21.259
Come on. There's no time.

00:21:31.478 --> 00:21:33.063
It's about to start.

00:21:39.736 --> 00:21:41.113
You remember that place, right?

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.533
The practice room
where you and Woo-seong first met.

00:21:49.621 --> 00:21:50.789
GOLD BOYS - LATE KANG WOO-SEONG

00:21:50.872 --> 00:21:52.582
The Gold Boys Fans raised money

00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:55.210
to put up that ad themselves.

00:21:56.128 --> 00:21:59.172
It is partly to honor the late Woo-seong.

00:22:00.674 --> 00:22:03.427
And partly to show
that there are still fans

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.846
who believe in you and are waiting.

00:22:09.474 --> 00:22:10.517
For you.

00:22:15.021 --> 00:22:19.568
There was an interview once,
where you said that…

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:22.654
…that sometimes you wish

00:22:23.238 --> 00:22:24.990
you could go back…

00:22:26.908 --> 00:22:29.828
to the beginning.

00:22:32.914 --> 00:22:34.457
This is the past.

00:22:35.458 --> 00:22:39.045
Every joy, every sorrow,

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:41.006
and every pain…

00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:45.051
it's all still here.

00:22:49.222 --> 00:22:51.892
The past doesn't flow away.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.187
It stays exactly

00:22:56.104 --> 00:22:57.355
where it is, unchanged.

00:22:58.356 --> 00:23:01.902
But what matters more than that is…

00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:10.118
…whether it's back then or now,

00:23:11.036 --> 00:23:13.705
there are so many people
who still believe in you

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:16.583
and cheer for you, no matter who you are.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.216
LA-IK,
WE WILL WAIT

00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:37.812
Why are you acting like this?

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:40.523
It is not like I made anything up.

00:23:40.607 --> 00:23:43.985
You still should have talked
to CEO Geum first.

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:47.405
I did. He told me not to say anything,
so I kept my mouth shut until now.

00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:48.657
And look what happened.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.450
Now they suspect me.

00:23:50.533 --> 00:23:52.827
You went to the prosecutors

00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:55.455
and booked interviews
with unconfirmed info?

00:23:55.538 --> 00:23:58.250
What will you say?
That La-ik is the killer?

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:00.794
Why do you keep taking his side?

00:24:01.378 --> 00:24:04.547
He went behind our backs
and tried to sign with another company!

00:24:04.631 --> 00:24:06.967
-Why defend someone like that?
-Because it was not La-ik!

00:24:16.351 --> 00:24:19.187
If it was not him, who was it?

00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:23.566
Anyway, what happened
at the prosecutor's office must not leak.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.403
The CEO Geum will not let it slide.

00:24:26.486 --> 00:24:28.947
Let him not slide it.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:32.284
If he wants me to stay quiet,
tell him this.

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:34.744
If he refuses my renewal
and leaves me hanging like this,

00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:36.371
I will not stay quiet.

00:24:36.454 --> 00:24:39.582
I will tell everything
I know to the press.

00:24:39.666 --> 00:24:40.834
Fine.

00:24:40.917 --> 00:24:45.255
I'll try to get the contract renewal
for you and Young-bin.

00:24:45.338 --> 00:24:46.589
There is no need.

00:24:52.804 --> 00:24:53.722
I'm not doing it.

00:24:53.805 --> 00:24:54.889
-What?
-Hey.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:57.684
What are you talking about?

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:01.062
Last time, La-ik came to see me.

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:03.398
That day…

00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:06.860
I could not even look him in the eyes.
I felt too guilty.

00:25:06.943 --> 00:25:08.445
Guilty about what?

00:25:08.528 --> 00:25:10.739
-He is the one who--
-Stop please!

00:25:12.866 --> 00:25:14.326
You know it too.

00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:17.078
How close La-ik and Woo-seong were.

00:25:18.913 --> 00:25:21.207
You know he would never do
something like that.

00:25:23.877 --> 00:25:25.253
Know what?

00:25:25.337 --> 00:25:28.506
You know nothing.
So what makes you think you…

00:25:29.507 --> 00:25:30.508
You are right.

00:25:32.427 --> 00:25:34.179
I don't know anything.

00:25:34.262 --> 00:25:35.221
But

00:25:36.848 --> 00:25:38.350
I do know this one thing.

00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:40.894
We can't keep

00:25:42.395 --> 00:25:43.897
going like this.

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:48.234
Jae-hee,

00:25:49.361 --> 00:25:51.613
how did we end up like this?

00:25:59.913 --> 00:26:00.789
Hey!

00:26:02.415 --> 00:26:03.375
Young-bin!

00:26:10.548 --> 00:26:11.966
YOU SHINE BRIGHTER THAN ANY LIGHT

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.135
You held a face-to-face interrogation?

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:15.387
Yes.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.515
The witness admitted
lying about his alibi.

00:26:18.598 --> 00:26:22.936
So we plan to investigate
both the witness and the suspect.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.646
What does that mean?

00:26:25.313 --> 00:26:27.190
The one who was at the scene

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:29.943
and the one who lied about the alibi.

00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:33.321
One of them is likely hiding something.

00:26:34.114 --> 00:26:37.992
In the end, once we find
solid evidence on either one,

00:26:38.076 --> 00:26:40.370
-we can--
-Either one?

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:45.125
That vague approach is exactly
why the investigation is wobbling.

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:49.421
A prosecutor isn't someone
who picks one of two options.

00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:53.758
He points to one truth with conviction.

00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:57.679
But the key witness lied.

00:26:57.762 --> 00:26:59.722
La-ik's lawyer will attack that.

00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:03.184
So I thought we should consider--

00:27:03.268 --> 00:27:04.519
So what,

00:27:04.602 --> 00:27:07.814
you will switch suspects
and start over with someone else?

00:27:08.773 --> 00:27:12.861
Then switch again
when the evidence is lacking?

00:27:12.944 --> 00:27:14.154
But

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:16.448
if La-ik is really not the culprit--

00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:20.160
That fragile mindset
is why your case keeps drifting.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.038
You pick your target from the start,

00:27:24.122 --> 00:27:26.082
and you push all the way through.

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.879
-Yes.
-Every time you flip suspects,

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:34.632
you damage not just yourself,
but the entire prosecution.

00:27:34.716 --> 00:27:38.344
And if his side releases an article

00:27:39.095 --> 00:27:42.098
claiming the prosecution failed early on

00:27:42.182 --> 00:27:44.642
and accused an innocent man?

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.645
Then you are finished.

00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:56.029
An investigation is no different
from a hunt.

00:27:57.238 --> 00:28:01.367
Once you pick your prey,
you chase until you catch it.

00:28:02.785 --> 00:28:04.454
That is how you earn your trophy.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.750
Yes. I understand.

00:28:27.352 --> 00:28:32.482
My mom did take the advance,
so some of what Jae-hee said wasn't wrong.

00:28:33.358 --> 00:28:37.445
I asked Chung-jae to track down
the company she allegedly signed with.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:41.199
Even if the deal went through,
you did not sign it.

00:28:41.282 --> 00:28:43.910
We can void it easily.

00:28:43.993 --> 00:28:47.455
The issue is countering
the narrative of conflict

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:49.123
with Goldie Entertainment.

00:28:49.207 --> 00:28:50.917
I'll talk to CEO Geum first.

00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:54.629
-CEO Geum?
-Yeah.

00:28:54.712 --> 00:28:56.381
He knows.

00:28:57.131 --> 00:29:00.635
I was sick of him
and was planning not to renew,

00:29:00.718 --> 00:29:02.971
but I had to keep going with Gold Boys.

00:29:03.054 --> 00:29:05.181
We were negotiating the renewal again.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.350
If we can prove that…

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:11.104
Then we can break a big part
of Jae-hee's statement. But…

00:29:11.896 --> 00:29:13.147
Will he actually help us?

00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:17.318
I don't know. He is impossible to predict.

00:29:30.582 --> 00:29:33.126
Get some rest.
I need to step out for a bit.

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:34.127
Where are you going?

00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:38.214
I will be back soon.
If you are hungry, eat something first.

00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:11.998
I'm sorry about that day.

00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:15.001
I just panicked.

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.171
It's okay.

00:30:19.047 --> 00:30:19.964
I just hope

00:30:21.007 --> 00:30:23.092
you didn't misunderstand.

00:30:24.135 --> 00:30:25.845
I brought Do La-ik to my place

00:30:25.929 --> 00:30:29.265
because his home
and everything in it had been seized,

00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:31.351
-so he had nowhere to stay.
-I know.

00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:36.940
His house was seized, his company was
already considering ending the contract.

00:30:37.023 --> 00:30:40.526
A hotel would draw too much attention,

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.947
and leaving him alone felt dangerous.

00:30:44.781 --> 00:30:46.574
So you took him in. Right?

00:30:50.912 --> 00:30:54.415
I'm sure you already know this firm.
It's the best in the country.

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:57.752
Their managing partner wants to meet you.

00:30:58.753 --> 00:31:01.464
He has been interested
in La-ik's case for a long time.

00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:06.469
Nothing will change.

00:31:06.552 --> 00:31:10.515
You will still be the lead attorney.

00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:13.434
You'll just have more help.

00:31:15.937 --> 00:31:19.941
I'm sorry, but I don't work that way.

00:31:20.024 --> 00:31:22.318
Could you at least let me help
even in a small way?

00:31:24.237 --> 00:31:26.155
La-ik and I have been together…

00:31:29.325 --> 00:31:30.994
for over ten years.

00:31:32.787 --> 00:31:37.333
We were apart for a few years,
but that kind of time means nothing to us.

00:31:38.918 --> 00:31:43.256
For La-ik, I've always been his only love,

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:45.133
and it is the same for me.

00:31:46.801 --> 00:31:49.303
If I can't even help with this,

00:31:50.346 --> 00:31:52.098
I don't think I can bear it.

00:31:57.353 --> 00:31:58.730
If I need help,

00:31:59.939 --> 00:32:01.649
I will definitely contact you.

00:32:04.861 --> 00:32:06.863
Are you sure you'll be okay
meeting him alone?

00:32:07.572 --> 00:32:10.616
If someone else is there,
CEO Geum will not say anything.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.285
It is better if I go by myself.

00:32:12.368 --> 00:32:16.706
Still, just in case, I will wait outside.
Call me if anything happens.

00:32:17.623 --> 00:32:18.791
I will be fine.

00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:27.592
Attorney Maeng!

00:32:31.095 --> 00:32:32.180
Thank you.

00:33:06.547 --> 00:33:08.257
Thanks.

00:33:12.637 --> 00:33:16.265
I was going to call you,
funny, we ran into each other.

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:19.852
What brings you here?

00:33:19.936 --> 00:33:21.562
Nothing much. Just…

00:33:23.106 --> 00:33:25.983
This place is nice.
You see all the celebrities.

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:29.737
So what brings you here?

00:33:29.821 --> 00:33:31.781
Is it about a client?

00:33:31.864 --> 00:33:35.535
Yes. Our client needs
to meet with CEO Geum.

00:33:42.875 --> 00:33:43.960
Well…

00:33:46.003 --> 00:33:47.547
you don't need to drop

00:33:48.589 --> 00:33:50.258
Do La-ik's case.

00:33:51.926 --> 00:33:53.302
Long time no see.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.847
How have you been?

00:33:57.056 --> 00:34:00.268
You look a bit worn out
since I last saw you.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.397
Even now, all you notice is my face.

00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:07.942
What, worried I won't sell anymore?

00:34:11.112 --> 00:34:13.239
You're not here to pick a fight.

00:34:15.533 --> 00:34:18.411
I heard you had
a face-to-face interrogation with Jae-hee.

00:34:22.415 --> 00:34:24.292
Jae-hee keeps saying weird things.

00:34:24.375 --> 00:34:27.753
That I tried to sign with another company.

00:34:27.837 --> 00:34:29.338
Did you know about that, too?

00:34:30.423 --> 00:34:34.093
-No.
-You know that is not true.

00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:38.055
We were going back and forth
with drafts for my renewal.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.265
I know.

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:43.978
I know you were trying
to protect Gold Boys until the end.

00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:49.066
You said you would not renew
unless every member got a contract.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.860
Jae-hee still doesn't know that.

00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:52.445
That's probably why he thinks that.

00:34:52.528 --> 00:34:53.446
Then…

00:34:53.529 --> 00:34:59.535
Everything you and I discussed
is in the draft.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:02.705
That you had no intention
of leaving Gold Boys.

00:35:02.788 --> 00:35:05.291
And how you really feel about the members.

00:35:05.875 --> 00:35:08.502
Anyone who reads it will understand.

00:35:08.586 --> 00:35:12.215
If needed, I can testify in court.

00:35:13.466 --> 00:35:14.800
Officially,

00:35:15.343 --> 00:35:18.137
you are still under my label.

00:35:19.055 --> 00:35:21.849
And I have known you

00:35:22.558 --> 00:35:25.228
for almost 20 years now.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.315
If I had married and had a kid,

00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:31.567
he would probably be about your age.

00:35:33.903 --> 00:35:38.866
As long as it does not harm the company,

00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:41.869
I will help however I can.

00:35:42.995 --> 00:35:47.458
But that is as far as I can go.

00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:49.543
Proving your innocence

00:35:49.627 --> 00:35:51.545
is something you have to do.

00:35:58.427 --> 00:35:59.887
Last time

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.432
after what you said,
I have been thinking a lot.

00:36:04.517 --> 00:36:07.728
I was the one preaching that

00:36:07.812 --> 00:36:09.689
you must trust your client no matter what,

00:36:09.772 --> 00:36:11.983
but I realized

00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:14.777
I was the one who forgot that.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.070
I feel ashamed

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.781
when I see you.

00:36:19.865 --> 00:36:22.827
Even if nobody else noticed,
I should have.

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:25.871
You only took big money cases

00:36:25.955 --> 00:36:30.001
because of me and the firm.

00:36:30.084 --> 00:36:31.877
You were trying to clear my debts.

00:36:34.755 --> 00:36:36.882
What are you talking about?
That's not what it was.

00:36:36.966 --> 00:36:38.676
Do not brush it off.

00:36:38.759 --> 00:36:41.345
You saying that
just makes me feel smaller.

00:36:42.763 --> 00:36:45.099
After I left like that day,

00:36:45.766 --> 00:36:47.893
all those old memories came back.

00:36:49.437 --> 00:36:52.023
Back then,
I didn't even have a proper car,

00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:55.484
so we always took the bus everywhere.

00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:57.903
Every time we went to see your father,

00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:01.657
I kept telling you not to come.

00:37:02.283 --> 00:37:06.495
But you still followed me
all the way out there every time.

00:37:06.579 --> 00:37:07.747
Well,

00:37:09.123 --> 00:37:12.293
I can still see it.

00:37:12.376 --> 00:37:15.338
That bus that never came
even when we waited forever.

00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:20.843
Then a random truck would pass
and cover us in white dust.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.096
If it rained, you stood in the rain.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.641
If it snowed, you stood in the snow,

00:37:28.476 --> 00:37:29.852
shivering

00:37:30.728 --> 00:37:33.272
in that remote place.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.277
Sometimes I wonder
how I could live like that.

00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:41.822
Why are you bringing
all that up now? Seriously.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.957
For you, it is not just the past.

00:37:54.668 --> 00:37:57.463
This case, the reason you can't let it go

00:37:58.172 --> 00:37:59.757
is your father, right?

00:38:19.443 --> 00:38:22.613
This case and your father's case

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:24.240
have a lot in common.

00:38:25.533 --> 00:38:29.120
At first, I couldn't get
why you were acting like this.

00:38:31.163 --> 00:38:32.915
But watching you,
it started to make sense.

00:38:37.837 --> 00:38:38.963
I still think

00:38:40.297 --> 00:38:42.049
about that day sometimes.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:47.054
The last day I went to see my dad.

00:38:47.138 --> 00:38:48.973
Say it's not you.

00:38:49.056 --> 00:38:51.350
Tell me you didn't do it. Now.

00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:53.310
I'm sorry.

00:38:53.978 --> 00:38:55.271
Don't say you are sorry.

00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:58.858
Why won't you say it?!

00:39:01.402 --> 00:39:04.864
If I say I didn't, will you believe me?

00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:09.577
If I say I didn't do it,

00:39:10.286 --> 00:39:11.495
will you believe me?

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.499
In the end

00:39:16.584 --> 00:39:17.960
I couldn't say it.

00:39:19.712 --> 00:39:21.172
"I believe you."

00:39:22.089 --> 00:39:23.883
That simple line.

00:39:24.592 --> 00:39:25.468
No.

00:39:26.719 --> 00:39:27.928
Se-na.

00:39:30.055 --> 00:39:31.140
I really…

00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:35.060
didn't do it.

00:39:36.979 --> 00:39:38.147
And…

00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:42.401
that's how he passed away

00:39:43.444 --> 00:39:45.571
with that hurt look on his face.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.169
My dad,

00:40:01.128 --> 00:40:03.714
even after the whole world
threw harsh words at him,

00:40:03.797 --> 00:40:06.634
even when I resented him,

00:40:07.218 --> 00:40:10.095
you were the only one
who stayed by his side

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:11.680
until the end.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.769
Because he was someone I could trust.

00:40:18.437 --> 00:40:19.813
I still believe that.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.900
From what I saw of Maeng Ji-yong,

00:40:22.983 --> 00:40:25.569
there's no way
he'd ever do something like that.

00:40:27.279 --> 00:40:28.948
For you,

00:40:29.031 --> 00:40:31.325
Do La-ik is that kind of person now.

00:40:33.577 --> 00:40:36.205
That's why you want to stay
by his side to the end.

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:48.759
Anyway,

00:40:49.635 --> 00:40:53.639
I won't nag you about this case.

00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:56.433
Don't end up like me and regret it later.

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:57.643
See it through to the end.

00:40:57.726 --> 00:40:59.853
I will cover you if anything happens.

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:01.647
Got it?

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:07.570
I'm leaving.

00:42:21.644 --> 00:42:22.936
Aren't you going to sleep?

00:42:24.396 --> 00:42:26.231
I can't sleep with the lights on.

00:42:27.608 --> 00:42:29.693
You told me to work here
so you won't be alone.

00:42:29.777 --> 00:42:32.237
No, I didn't mean you should leave.

00:43:03.602 --> 00:43:07.439
-Do you have something to say?
-No.

00:43:07.523 --> 00:43:09.274
Then why do you keep sneaking looks at me.

00:43:09.358 --> 00:43:11.068
Me? When?

00:43:13.529 --> 00:43:14.905
What?

00:43:16.949 --> 00:43:17.950
What?

00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:22.329
I can see everything…

00:43:22.413 --> 00:43:23.956
how you feel right now,

00:43:24.039 --> 00:43:25.916
what is going through your head.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:28.836
What are you, some mind reader?

00:43:31.797 --> 00:43:33.090
From here…

00:43:35.676 --> 00:43:37.177
you just look tired.

00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:38.303
Go to sleep.

00:43:39.304 --> 00:43:40.472
Wait a minute!

00:43:42.224 --> 00:43:44.393
-Are you very busy right now?
-Why?

00:43:44.476 --> 00:43:46.395
If you are not,

00:43:47.396 --> 00:43:48.772
maybe we could talk.

00:43:48.856 --> 00:43:49.773
Talk about what?

00:43:49.857 --> 00:43:51.108
You know, just…

00:43:53.402 --> 00:43:54.611
I'm busy.

00:43:54.695 --> 00:43:56.363
No, I don't know anything, that's why.

00:43:58.157 --> 00:44:01.702
I realized I have never asked about you.

00:44:01.785 --> 00:44:04.163
Why? What made you curious now?

00:44:04.246 --> 00:44:05.873
I mean, think about it.

00:44:05.956 --> 00:44:07.458
You just look at my eyes

00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:09.334
and know how I feel
and what I am thinking.

00:44:10.002 --> 00:44:11.462
But I know little about you.

00:44:11.545 --> 00:44:13.046
It feels pretty unfair.

00:44:19.094 --> 00:44:21.096
I don't like personal questions.

00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:24.600
It's not like I want to dig that deep.

00:44:28.103 --> 00:44:29.521
What do you do when it's tough?

00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:31.648
-I work.
-Not that.

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:34.860
Like hobbies. You got none?

00:44:35.778 --> 00:44:37.112
Well…

00:44:40.949 --> 00:44:41.784
DO LA-IK'S IT'S ME VIDEO PHOTOSHOOT

00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:42.743
What?

00:44:43.327 --> 00:44:44.828
Not really.

00:44:44.912 --> 00:44:46.246
Then what do you live for?

00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:49.458
Okay then, what about food?

00:44:50.292 --> 00:44:51.835
What food do you like?

00:44:53.337 --> 00:44:55.255
Anything quick and easy to eat?

00:44:55.339 --> 00:44:56.548
No, I mean specifically!

00:44:58.008 --> 00:44:59.092
Gimbap?

00:45:01.178 --> 00:45:04.264
So you like things
that take a lot of work. Just like me.

00:45:05.474 --> 00:45:06.975
Well, I mean,

00:45:07.809 --> 00:45:11.897
it has all the main nutrients balanced.
Everyone likes gimbap.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.566
Then what do you do to relax?

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:17.110
Watch TV, read, listen to music?

00:45:19.446 --> 00:45:21.323
I love you, Do La-ik!

00:45:22.074 --> 00:45:25.244
I don't listen to music.

00:45:25.327 --> 00:45:26.745
-You don't?
-Not really.

00:45:26.828 --> 00:45:28.956
How can a person not listen to music?

00:45:29.498 --> 00:45:30.791
No wonder your life feels so dry.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:32.960
No, this won't do.

00:45:35.254 --> 00:45:37.130
-Get up.
-Sorry?

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.850
Hey, Do La-ik. Where are we going?

00:45:50.102 --> 00:45:51.645
Come over here for a bit.

00:45:52.646 --> 00:45:54.690
Why here in the middle of the night?

00:45:55.983 --> 00:45:57.568
Because there is music here.

00:46:08.745 --> 00:46:10.706
What if someone sees us?

00:46:29.558 --> 00:46:31.435
Come on. Sit.

00:46:36.481 --> 00:46:37.858
You said you don't listen to music.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.528
I will show you why people do.

00:46:59.546 --> 00:47:00.547
Music is this.

00:47:03.967 --> 00:47:05.010
It doesn't lie.

00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:07.679
You can't fool anyone with it.

00:47:07.763 --> 00:47:10.265
Because music is all about…

00:47:20.776 --> 00:47:21.860
harmony…

00:47:27.032 --> 00:47:28.825
and melody.

00:47:30.827 --> 00:47:33.080
Music is simple and clear.

00:47:34.122 --> 00:47:35.707
That's why it can reach anywhere.

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:38.502
Even the deepest part of someone's heart.

00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.218
That's why you need it.

00:47:46.802 --> 00:47:51.098
A song you can listen to
whenever the hard memories come back.

00:47:54.726 --> 00:47:57.104
So tell me…

00:48:01.358 --> 00:48:02.401
What?

00:48:03.235 --> 00:48:04.778
I was thinking…

00:48:04.861 --> 00:48:08.740
You always do things for me,
and I've done nothing for you.

00:48:09.741 --> 00:48:12.077
I hate feeling like I owe someone.

00:48:13.453 --> 00:48:15.747
Right now,

00:48:16.707 --> 00:48:17.833
this is all I can give.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.337
So hurry up
and tell me what you want to hear.

00:48:27.384 --> 00:48:28.260
But…

00:48:30.554 --> 00:48:34.307
we're not music.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.521
That's why we're always lying.

00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:45.694
What if you found out
that someone you really trusted…

00:48:48.155 --> 00:48:51.283
told you a huge lie.

00:48:52.826 --> 00:48:54.578
What do you think you would do?

00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.289
What could I do?

00:48:58.582 --> 00:49:01.001
That's all they do.

00:49:03.128 --> 00:49:05.130
I don't really expect much from anyone.

00:49:06.006 --> 00:49:08.216
So I doubt it would hurt that much.

00:49:21.396 --> 00:49:24.441
Just listen.

00:49:25.567 --> 00:49:26.902
You have had a rough day.

00:49:59.309 --> 00:50:05.023
Rain is falling in your small heart

00:50:06.608 --> 00:50:12.405
On the day your whole world
Starts to fall apart

00:50:13.657 --> 00:50:20.038
I can feel your footsteps
As you wander

00:50:21.414 --> 00:50:26.711
Searching for a place to lean on

00:50:30.507 --> 00:50:36.346
I'll hold you in my arms

00:50:38.056 --> 00:50:43.478
You who are worn out from so much pain

00:50:45.105 --> 00:50:52.028
In the deepening night

00:50:52.863 --> 00:50:58.952
A shining star will light your sky

00:51:00.036 --> 00:51:03.415
And I'll be here

00:51:03.498 --> 00:51:10.338
So the rough waves
Never shake you again

00:51:10.422 --> 00:51:13.758
Please, turn your eyes to me

00:51:16.887 --> 00:51:22.434
If the rain ever falls
On your heart once more

00:51:24.311 --> 00:51:30.775
I promise I'll be right by your side

00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:36.383
I found him.

00:52:36.466 --> 00:52:37.926
Are you sure?

00:52:38.009 --> 00:52:41.137
Yes. He's from Achi Entertainment's
management support team.

00:52:41.221 --> 00:52:44.182
He has a history with shady contracts.

00:52:44.265 --> 00:52:47.644
He likely handled
the Gold Boys contract too.

00:52:48.478 --> 00:52:49.813
Should I approach him?

00:52:50.355 --> 00:52:52.440
No. I'll meet him myself.

00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:54.985
Okay.

00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:07.414
-You are heading out now?
-Yes.

00:53:07.497 --> 00:53:10.041
Then give me the door key before you go.

00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:11.292
The key? Why?

00:53:11.376 --> 00:53:14.129
You know, I might go out for a walk,

00:53:14.212 --> 00:53:16.006
maybe stretch a little.

00:53:16.089 --> 00:53:17.549
I can't stay inside all day.

00:53:19.509 --> 00:53:20.593
Well…

00:53:21.219 --> 00:53:24.514
You can't get seen or photographed.

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:25.598
Fine.

00:53:26.433 --> 00:53:28.560
-Be careful.
-Okay.

00:53:44.576 --> 00:53:46.244
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:53:48.288 --> 00:53:49.831
Give it to me so I can scan it.

00:54:45.553 --> 00:54:47.722
LA-IK

00:54:58.191 --> 00:55:00.068
Oh, my God, look who it is!

00:55:00.693 --> 00:55:04.030
-How have you been?
-How do you think I've been?

00:55:04.114 --> 00:55:07.575
You little brat.
Why didn't you answer any of my calls?

00:55:08.535 --> 00:55:10.995
You must've gone through a lot
because of me.

00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:13.248
You even had to go in for questioning.

00:55:13.331 --> 00:55:15.083
With what?

00:55:15.166 --> 00:55:17.168
You are the one having the hard time.

00:55:18.837 --> 00:55:22.048
At Woo-seong's funeral,

00:55:22.132 --> 00:55:24.008
you looked like a ghost.

00:55:24.926 --> 00:55:26.928
Because of reporters,
I couldn't even say hello.

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:31.808
Hey, why are you crying?
If you cry, I'm hanging up.

00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:34.185
Who's crying?

00:55:34.769 --> 00:55:36.271
Anyway, are you eating properly?

00:55:36.354 --> 00:55:39.149
That's actually why I called.

00:55:41.568 --> 00:55:42.944
You know… that thing.

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.238
What thing?

00:55:45.321 --> 00:55:50.451
When I felt down, you used to make gimbap
with lots of ham and burdock.

00:55:50.535 --> 00:55:52.495
It was nothing like the store-bought ones.

00:55:52.579 --> 00:55:53.997
I wanted to know how you made it.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:55.248
Why?

00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:57.542
Craving gimbap?

00:55:57.625 --> 00:55:59.252
Should I bring you some?

00:55:59.335 --> 00:56:03.798
No. I want to make it myself for someone.

00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:05.175
Make it? For who?

00:56:07.844 --> 00:56:08.928
There is someone.

00:56:09.637 --> 00:56:12.223
Someone who loves gimbap more than anyone.

00:56:12.307 --> 00:56:17.312
Actually, our legal team was planning
to reach out to Mr. Do La-ik.

00:56:17.395 --> 00:56:20.899
The contract is already signed
and the advance payment has been made.

00:56:21.733 --> 00:56:24.485
Recent incidents demand
a talk about termination.

00:56:26.279 --> 00:56:28.740
This contract can't be legally recognized.

00:56:28.823 --> 00:56:30.742
So there's no need to discuss termination.

00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:31.826
Sorry?

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:34.454
A contract signed without
the party's consent is void.

00:56:34.537 --> 00:56:36.247
The actual party is Do La-ik,

00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:39.542
yet you signed it with his mother,
who is a third party.

00:56:39.626 --> 00:56:41.753
She is not his legal guardian.

00:56:41.836 --> 00:56:44.505
-Well, that's because--
-Also, the one who received the deposit

00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:46.299
was not Do La-ik, but Do Mi-gyeong.

00:56:46.382 --> 00:56:48.218
He doesn't need to return the obligation.

00:56:48.301 --> 00:56:51.429
We understand the legal issue,

00:56:51.512 --> 00:56:54.015
-but we are victims too--
-Victims?

00:56:54.098 --> 00:56:57.185
You are the one who signed
without the artist's consent.

00:56:58.228 --> 00:57:00.396
Why would you proceed
with something so reckless?

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:04.150
Because we trusted them.

00:57:04.817 --> 00:57:05.735
They approached us,

00:57:05.818 --> 00:57:09.239
saying they were looking
for a company willing to take Gold Boys,

00:57:09.322 --> 00:57:12.742
so things naturally moved forward
from there.

00:57:12.825 --> 00:57:15.286
We assumed everything
was already arranged.

00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:17.455
Agreed with whom?

00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:18.706
His mother?

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.042
No. With Kang Woo-seong.

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:24.295
What?

00:57:24.379 --> 00:57:25.922
Okay.

00:57:27.382 --> 00:57:28.383
Seaweed,

00:57:29.551 --> 00:57:31.803
burdock, ham…

00:57:33.846 --> 00:57:35.181
and…

00:57:38.268 --> 00:57:39.102
Wait. Rice.

00:57:40.895 --> 00:57:43.398
No. Rice.

00:58:06.754 --> 00:58:07.880
ATTORNEY MAENG SE-NA

00:58:11.134 --> 00:58:13.011
JERK KING

00:58:20.476 --> 00:58:21.477
Hello?

00:58:21.561 --> 00:58:23.396
I wanted to ask you something.

00:58:23.479 --> 00:58:25.315
Is there rice in this house or not?

00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:26.441
Rice?

00:58:26.524 --> 00:58:29.485
Are you hungry?
If you're hungry, just order something.

00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:31.112
No, do we have it or not?

00:58:31.195 --> 00:58:34.032
I don't know. Maybe in the attic?

00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:35.950
Ask Attorney Maeng.

00:58:36.034 --> 00:58:37.994
Attic? Okay.

00:59:50.983 --> 00:59:52.485
The best subject award…

00:59:52.568 --> 00:59:54.737
THE BEST SUBJECT AWARD

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.504
COUPON FOR DISHWASH

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:15.383
DAD IS A SUPERMAN

01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:08.352
The one who arranged the deal
was Kang Woo-seong.

01:01:08.978 --> 01:01:12.732
He was sure he could bring Do La-ik to us.

01:01:12.815 --> 01:01:15.109
So we coordinated the deal.

01:01:15.193 --> 01:01:18.446
Because Do La-ik is top tier,

01:01:18.529 --> 01:01:20.656
we were in a hurry as well,

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.742
which is why we first signed
with his mother.

01:01:23.743 --> 01:01:26.788
Everything had already been
agreed with Kang Woo-seong.

01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:51.229
Do La-ik?

01:01:53.564 --> 01:01:54.774
Do La-ik!

01:02:26.597 --> 01:02:27.849
Do La-ik…

01:02:32.979 --> 01:02:33.896
Tell me.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.193
Explain what all this is.

01:03:00.506 --> 01:03:02.049
Explain it.

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:30.995
THANK YOU TO ACTOR PARK WON-SANG
FOR THE SPECIAL APPEARANCE

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:12.703
I can't believe any of it.

01:04:12.787 --> 01:04:14.997
-La-ik.
-You're fired.

01:04:15.957 --> 01:04:18.876
I hope the two of you never meet again.

01:04:20.795 --> 01:04:23.923
Don't you see how worried I am?

01:04:24.548 --> 01:04:27.343
How would I know where Jae-hee is?

01:04:27.969 --> 01:04:30.012
We need to get to him
before the police do.

01:04:30.096 --> 01:04:33.099
That Geum Bo-sang guy,
he's not someone you can trust.

01:04:33.182 --> 01:04:35.851
We found him.

01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:41.899
