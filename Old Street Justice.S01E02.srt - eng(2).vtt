WEBVTT

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:43.240
Stop

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.880
You've grown up, huh?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.320
Don't be shy.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.000
Er Ni

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.119
Impulse is the devil.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:58.759
Impulse is the devil, Er Ni!

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.840
No

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.600
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.640
Shengzi, is this girl feisty enough for you?

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.400
Gangzi, you son of a bitch, you set me up!

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.159
Zhao Fengsheng, stop!

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.840
If we don't let Er Ni vent her anger...

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.760
...where will she vent the fire she's held for five years?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.959
Er Ni

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.159
Er Ni, don't be impulsive, Er Ni!

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:24.599
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:25.599
You jerk, stop!

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.599
I said, hurry up!

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:28.560
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.079
That scoundrel's sneaked back.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.200
That filthy hooligan!

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.519
Causing trouble for girls as soon as he's back.

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:33.280
Let's go.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.200
Go, go, beat him out of here!

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.959
Go, go, go!

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:37.719
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.359
Stop!

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.319
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.400
Stop!

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.680
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.599
Run faster!

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.439
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:46.359
You jerk!

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.079
Er Ni

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.280
You stop, Zhao Fengsheng!

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.680
Hit him!

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.640
Neighbors!

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.040
It's a misunderstanding!

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.319
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.879
Neighbors, it's a misunderstanding!

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.680
Hurry, hurry!

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.400
Er Ni

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.920
Listen to me!

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.200
What did that jerk Zhao Fengsheng do to you?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.159
Nothing!

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.000
It's a misunderstanding, Mom!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.840
Er Ni, Er Ni!

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.599
Don't be afraid.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.439
The neighbors will help you deal with him.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:09.759
No

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.479
Er Ni

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.520
Go back inside!

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.120
Mom

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.520
Go.

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:13.280
Filthy hooligan!

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.680
You dare come back?

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.479
Beat you to death!

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.159
Hit him!

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.479
Where'd he go?

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.240
Where is he?

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.000
Is he up ahead?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.719
Up ahead.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.360
Chase him that way!

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.960
Drive him out of Old Street!

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.039
Hiding from the neighbors, then hiding from Er Ni.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.520
Hiding from Er Ni, then hiding from the neighbors again.

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.680
Can't let them keep misunderstanding like this.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.719
Need to talk to them.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.680
Looking like I'm sneaking around at night...

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.039
...if I go explain to the neighbors now...

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.360
...they'd surely beat me to death.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.439
That kid Dafo...

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.280
...was chasing me the most enthusiastically.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.960
So borrowing his clothes isn't too much to ask.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.199
This is Dafo's son.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.719
Just like his father was as a kid.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.080
Don't worry, Brother Xiaobei.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.879
Before tomorrow morning...

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.319
...this kid will be delivered to the Traffickers' Village.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.479
Be smart about it.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.800
The boss has given orders.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.159
We must frame Zhao Fengsheng for the goods theft.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.919
Go.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.039
Move.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.599
What are you doing?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.719
Put the child down.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.039
Put him down!

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.439
Fancy meeting you here.

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.719
Get out of my way.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.519
I don't have time for this.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.240
Stop him!

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.240
Stop the car!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.279
Put the child down!

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.000
Someone, help!

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.040
Zhao Fengsheng is kidnapping the child!

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.279
What's going on?

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.360
What happened?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.720
Come out, quick!

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.240
Everyone, come out!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.079
What's the matter?

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.839
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.600
Zhao Fengsheng took Xiaoxiao!

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.279
Xiaoxiao!

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.800
You're turning the tables on me?

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.639
My Xiaoxiao!

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.160
Neighbors!

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:39.759
The trafficker is Chen Xiaobei!

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:39.839
Chen Xiaobei is the trafficker!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.759
If he hadn't stopped me from chasing the car...

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.279
If he hadn't blocked me...

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.800
I would've saved Xiaoxiao already!

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.639
That's bullshit!

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.759
If I hadn't stopped you...

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:45.879
you would've gotten in the car and fled!

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.279
My two brothers can vouch for me.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.319
Yes, it was him! It was him!

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:48.879
He really did it.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.839
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.040
Give my Xiaoxiao back!

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.639
Auntie Feng...

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:53.000
You...

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:54.720
The clothes are mine.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.160
If it's not you, Zhao Fengsheng, then who?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.959
My Xiaoxiao!

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:59.600
Mom! Mom!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.279
Xiaoxiao!

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.519
It's all my fault.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.439
I shouldn't have said those things about you not coming back to Old Street.

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:05.800
You're truly despicable.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.560
For the sake of all our years as neighbors...

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.600
I beg you, let Xiaoxiao go.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.480
Give Xiaoxiao back.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.240
I'll kowtow to you right here.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.759
Auntie Feng!

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.800
Mom! Mom!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.439
Neighbors!

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.319
I, Zhao Fengsheng, am also from Old Street.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.439
How could I do such a heartless thing?

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.759
Hand over Xiaoxiao!

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.000
Everyone, calm down!

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.199
Hand over the child!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.639
Don't push him too hard.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What if he...

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.120
hurts the child?

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.199
What then?

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:32.879
Dad.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.279
What do you mean?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.759
Just let him go look.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.079
As long as Xiaoxiao comes back...

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.519
we can deal with Zhao Fengsheng later.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.439
Fine.

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.240
I understand.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.879
Quiet, everyone!

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.560
Don't get worked up.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.959
Settle down!

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:45.720
Listen to me.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.839
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.000
Can you really bring my child back?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.959
Five years ago, because of me...

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:53.959
Because of what I did...

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.680
everyone lost the coal mine.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.839
But this time...

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:58.639
with everyone watching...

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.199
we'll see the truth in your actions.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.040
If by tomorrow noon...

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.079
you don't bring my child back...

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.240
I'll tear your house down.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920
and drive you out of Old Street for good.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.360
Neighbors!

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.240
Everyone!

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.000
Please, help look for her too.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.959
Alright, don't worry.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.519
Thank you.

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:15.920
Split up and search.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.920
Dafo.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.800
Let's search over there.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.600
I'll go with you.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.240
Let's go, together.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.959
Get lost.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.120
Fine.

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:26.480
If it's not him, then who?

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.360
Enough talk.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.720
He'll take revenge on us later.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.480
Hey, Boss Crow

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.560
The kidnapping of the child

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.879
has been pinned on Zhao Fengsheng.

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:38.680
He can't stay in Old Street anymore.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.480
Chen Xiaobei works for Wuya.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.319
Then we'll find Wuya.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.079
Once I get the child back,

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.680
you'll see how I settle the score with you, jerk.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.800
What?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.519
Shengzi kidnapped Xiaoxiao?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.480
How is that possible?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.399
Have they lost their minds?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.240
Where do you think you're going?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.959
That Zhao Fengsheng,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.920
fighting and brawling since he was a kid is one thing,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.839
but now he's even doing something as inhuman

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.759
as trafficking children.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.560
And you still dare to associate with that kind of person?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.279
Mom!

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.519
Did you see it with your own eyes?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.319
Forget it.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.240
I'm not talking to you.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.600
Where are you going?

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.360
Yaqing.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.720
Tianyu.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.240
Auntie.

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:13.879
Miss Qian.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.079
What brings you here?

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.920
I came to see you and your mom.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560
You didn't even come to the party I invited you to.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:19.639
Hello, Auntie.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:19.920
Have a seat.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.399
I can't even run into you at the spa.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.839
What have you been so busy with?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.800
Yaqing,

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:27.879
let me introduce someone to you.

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.720
Bai Yuchen.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.680
He's a department manager at our Qian Group.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.319
He's actually one of our group's

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.639
key young talents to be cultivated.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.240
Yuchen,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.959
this is my best friend, Cui Yaqing.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.120
Hello, Yaqing.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.839
Actually,

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:40.959
I've known about you for a long time.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.759
These,

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.279
are all gifts I brought for you

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.319
from Western Europe.

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:45.120
Please accept them.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:48.040
Let's be friends.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.560
I'm sorry,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.519
Tianyu's friends are my friends.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.160
There's no need for a special introduction.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.800
Right, right.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.319
As for the gifts,

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.160
they're not necessary.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.439
This silly girl doesn't know how to talk.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.759
Miss Qian, Manager Bai,

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:01.600
you two sit for a while.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:02.680
I'll go make some tea for you.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.959
Thank you, Auntie.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.079
So, what do you think?

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:10.680
Think about what?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.720
Don't play matchmaker.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.279
Take him away, now.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.360
I already have someone I like.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.720
Who?

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.519
Still that little punk?

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.959
How is he worthy of you?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.959
That's because you don't know Shengzi.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.560
I'll introduce you two another day.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.720
He's not that kind of person.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.120
He's back.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.879
The neighbors have some misunderstandings about him.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.120
I need to go see him.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.919
You two stay here.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:39.240
Yaqing!

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.120
You silly girl!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.080
You get back here!

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.519
That Er Ni girl,

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:47.879
has no manners at all.

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:48.759
Miss Qian,

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:49.559
have some tea.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.000
Manager Bai,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.960
here, have tea.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.039
Yaqing and Zhao Fengsheng are...

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.799
Our Er Ni

00:08:57.799 --> 00:09:00.519
has no such relationship with that Zhao Fengsheng.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.919
It's all because Er Ni was naive as a child.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.039
She spent all day playing with Zhao Fengsheng,

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:07.200
Gangzi, and Painted Face.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:08.840
As a result,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.559
they were called the Four Pests of the Old Street.

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:11.919
From now on, I absolutely forbid Er Ni

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.559
from having any contact with that trafficker.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600
Trafficker?

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.960
You don't know?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.519
Let me tell you.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.440
That Zhao Fengsheng,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.480
has no conscience.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.720
He's too wicked.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.159
Chen Xiaobei saw him

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.799
trafficking Xiaoxiao away.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:25.559
Bei Wazi!

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:27.440
You, the street procurement specialist,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.279
really know how to save money for Old Street.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.679
This time, at the Old Street Residents' Committee meeting,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.480
I'm going to praise you properly.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.960
Everyone has a hard time doing business.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.360
If I don't help the neighbors save money,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.600
they can't make ends meet.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.120
Right?

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:41.759
Hurry home for dinner.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.919
Sure, sure.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.200
Xiao Bei.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:58.960
Bro.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:09:59.879
A beauty.

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.600
You're a lucky man, bro.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.519
What nonsense are you talking?

00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:04.600
This is my grandaunt.

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.080
My dear lady.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.879
Where are you off to?

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.679
Playing mahjong.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.480
One player short of three.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.399
My dear lady,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.919
I still have some business with the guys.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:16.360
Next time.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:16.840
Definitely next time.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.720
What do you mean?

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.200
Afraid this lady has no money or something?

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:20.720
No.

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:22.440
Don't make this lady lose her temper.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.279
Let's go, quick.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:36.879
Hurry up!

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:37.720
Are you done yet?

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.559
Come on, come on.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.559
Is it burnt?

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.399
It's still raw.

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:42.919
Grill it a bit longer.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.159
Get a bottle of booze.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.759
What do you want?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.200
Who is it?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.000
Looking for trouble?

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.519
You're from Wuya, right?

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.159
You picking a fight?

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.480
Who do you work for?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.559
You've got it wrong, brothers.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.360
I have goods to move.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:06.159
I was hoping you guys

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.720
could introduce me to Boss Crow.

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:10.399
Boss Crow?

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:12.320
You think you can just meet him?

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:13.600
Here.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.440
Big brother.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.519
You think I need your damn cigarette?

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.200
No, it's not that.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.000
I have a lot of goods.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.039
If I can make a deal with Boss Crow,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.600
your cut will be substantial.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.120
Twenty percent.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:31.840
No problem.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.679
Follow me.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.919
Isn't Boss Crow on the boat?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.159
Are we talking or not?

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:39.960
We are.

00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:40.840
Of course we are.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.320
Boys!

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.399
Eat and drink up!

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:44.440
Come on, everyone.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.039
Sit wherever.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:45.759
Keep going.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.200
Three of Bamboos.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:52.440
Mahjong!

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:53.559
Flush!

00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:54.840
Not bad, Brother Xiaobei.

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.320
Your luck is really good.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.919
Making money again.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.240
This pot's a bit big, Grandaunt.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.960
Keep playing.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.440
Thanks, Grandaunt.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.879
Why am I so unlucky?

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:06.799
I keep losing.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.840
It's luck.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:08.799
Just luck.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.200
Blame that jerk Zhao Fengsheng.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.000
After knowing him for so many years,

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:15.039
I never thought he was that kind of guy.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.279
Zhao Fengsheng will be gone soon.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.480
Then you won't have to worry, Grandaunt.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.480
Shengzi will be gone?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.879
What do you mean?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.799
Did I say that?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.840
You didn't say it, right?

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:26.679
Seems not.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:27.320
Didn't say it.

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:28.879
Never said it.

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:30.279
You must have misheard, Grandaunt.

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.679
Still playing dumb with me?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.639
Talk.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120
What's really going on?
