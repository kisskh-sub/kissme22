00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.580
(Li Manor)

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.940
(Li Manor)

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.790
Madam,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.960
here's the Li Manor.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.240
I cannot go inside.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.920
If I enter, I will die for sure.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.870
General Li would never let you die.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.710
Please, go inside.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.220
(Late Guardian General Li Jingchuan)

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.960
Halt!

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.710
Are you Lady Yaochu?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.120
Yes.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.520
I'm the Prefecture
Governor's eldest daughter,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.150
Shen Yaochu.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.120
How dare you!

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.680
Now that you're in the Li Manor,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.310
you only address yourself as Madam Li.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.080
And who might you be?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.400
I have long served at Old Madam's side.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.280
You may call me Nanny Sun.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.120
So you're a servant.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.840
I'm marrying the General today,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.360
yet the Li family sends
only a servant to greet me.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.310
Old Madam is unwell,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.240
so she asked me to welcome you.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.240
Since you're now part of the Li family,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.630
you must abide by our household rules.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560
You came from outside the manor,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.960
bringing dirt.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.960
Please remove your shoes and socks

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.400
and walk barefoot
across this fire basin.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.120
Only then can the filth be
cleansed from your body.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.400
Take off my shoes and walk

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.080
barefoot over fire?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.120
Madam, please.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.910
General Li sacrificed for the empire.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.430
Not even his remains could return home.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.630
Yet in the whole Li family,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.310
no one came for his memorial tablet.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.560
You even pick on his rightful wife.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.750
How is this justified?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.800
Insolence!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800
This is the custom of the family.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.360
Then I will be insolent.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.910
How can you become the lady of the Li family?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.280
Yes.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.590
I am blunt and unruly.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Your Li family

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.880
(Late Guardian General Li Jingchuan)
might as well wed another!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.840
Guards!

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.560
Help the new bride brush away the dust

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.430
and purify her spirit with flags!

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.600
Remove her garments!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.870
What's all this noise?

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.980
(Zhao Qingru
Old Madam of Li Family)

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.880
Old Madam.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.000
The new bride shows no respect.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.430
Her conduct is reckless.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.800
I'm cleansing her as part of the ritual.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.950
You want me buried alive
with a dead man?

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.040
Keep dreaming!

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.040
To be buried as the rightful
wife is already

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480
a blessing for you.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.480
The new bride, Lady Yaochu,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.600
was overcome with grief.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.240
She struck the coffin and died,

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.600
and was laid to rest
beside my son, Jingchuan,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.390
in the same burial.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.950
I cannot die...

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.440
Old Madam?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.630
Beat her to death on the spot!

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.910
(Mother...)

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.200
(Forgive me.)

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.430
(I did my best.)

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.920
Welcome the Guardian General
home in triumph.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.500
(Xu Shan
Deputy General)

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.260
(Li Jingchuan
Eldest Son of Li Family)

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.600
(So he is...)

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.310
(Li Jingchuan.)

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.120
You're alive?

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.600
I barely made it.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.480
Old Madam must be disappointed.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.120
What nonsense?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.520
Seeing you alive,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.070
nothing makes me happier.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.150
Is that so?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.190
General, you may hold a great rank,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.190
but before Old Madam,
you're still junior.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.630
Why do you not dismount
to greet Old Madam?

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.230
Insolent servant!

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.480
You disrespect the General?

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.000
Old Madam,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.360
are you saying I must kneel?

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.120
Between mother and son,
such formality isn't needed.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.480
Yet since ancient times,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.240
it has always been ruler before kin.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.560
By our dynasty's rites,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.680
should it not be you, Old Madam,

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.120
who salutes me first?

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.510
Just joking.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.190
Why did you take it seriously?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.950
I heard Lady Yanchu thought
I had perished,

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.040
was grief-stricken, and wished
to be buried with me.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.510
Lady Youchu's unwavering devotion

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.630
is truly touching.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.750
I told you,

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.960
General Li would never let you die.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.150
Thank you, Old Madam, for my marriage.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.510
But keeping a coffin
in the courtyard is ill-omened.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.550
Let's skip the ceremony.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.640
(Tang Yuzhu Second Concubine)
Stop crying, it's so upsetting!

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.440
Yuzhu,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.150
(Qin Ruoyi Third Concubine)
we have waited two years for the General.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.840
But who would have thought

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.320
that the General would pass away?

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.840
Does that mean we must spend our lives

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.600
being widows here in this manor?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.960
If he's gone, we should just leave.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.960
The world is vast.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.480
Surely it can hold two women.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.200
But we are already wed.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.750
Whether we stay or go

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.870
is not for us to decide.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
The General isn't dead.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.080
What? What are you saying?

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.960
Am I not allowed to hear this?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.390
Yuzhu,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.440
the General is alive.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.630
He has returned.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.670
He's still alive?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.270
The General is still alive.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.630
If he's not dead,
why are you still in tears?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.630
These are tears of joy.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.840
Yet in my heart,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.870
there's still a trace of resentment.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.630
Why so?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.030
Yuzhu, think about it.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.150
Today, Old Madam

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.510
found the General a proper wife.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.510
Thought she was to be buried with him.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.600
But the General returned at such a time.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.560
So tonight

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.720
would become the couple's

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.360
wedding night?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.510
What else?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.670
We've waited two years for the General.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.270
Even the wedding night

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.790
should follow the order.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.840
But Lady Yanchu is the rightful wife.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.870
It's only fair she has
precedence over us.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.000
You're right, Yuzhu.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.870
The ceremony is over.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.040
Shall I leave now?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.320
It's not over yet.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.320
Tomorrow morning,

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.480
you must pay respects to Old Madam.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.630
General,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.030
tonight is our wedding night.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.750
If you choose to leave,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.270
how will I explain to Old Madam?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.960
What do you propose?

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.440
Let's make a deal.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.800
Tell me what it is.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.790
His Majesty values

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.000
harmony within families above all.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.120
Filial piety first.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:15.670
That's why Old Madam

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.270
endured so many misunderstandings

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.270
just to find you a proper wife,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.550
to silence the gossip.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.510
But today, I noticed that

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.000
the rift between you
and your mother ran deep.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.080
I heard that when you were away,

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.120
she married you two concubines.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.630
Not much peace inside

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.240
this household, yes?

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.720
With the household in disarray,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.320
if word reaches His Majesty,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.960
it surely won't bode well.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.440
Yuzhu,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.000
just now, Xiaocui told me,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.320
Lady Yaochu stood
in the Memorial Hall today,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.720
and openly defied Old Madam.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.000
If she lies beside the General tonight,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.080
spinning tales about us,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.600
then uses her sly charms to win

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.000
over the General's heart,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.320
you and I

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.960
will be stuck with
such a foolish mistress,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.720
and our days ahead will be hard.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.440
What should we do now?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.320
Yuzhu, wait a moment.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.000
Something urgent just came up.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.160
You… Go and rest.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.480
Have some snacks.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.320
I have something urgent to see to.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.440
Fool.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.390
I'll soothe the household for you.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.720
You protect the one at Guanyin Nunnery.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.110
Will that do?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.200
Who exactly in the Guanyin Nunnery

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.240
that you care so deeply about?

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.230
She's my mother.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.840
Alright then.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.480
I'll think this over.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.750
But don't stir any trouble again.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.080
If you bear a child one day,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.000
I could even arrange for your mother

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.910
to stay with you daily.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.990
General.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.510
When it comes to having heirs,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.630
my efforts alone won't change much.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.000
General, you must also give.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.560
For a woman,

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.320
your courage is remarkable.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.870
And why is that a problem?

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.750
(If offering myself could
make him protect my mother,)

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.200
(then why not?)
