WEBVTT

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.399
Stay out of the way.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.039
Shengzi.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:51.479
I'm fine.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.759
Old as you are, and you still resort to sneak attacks.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.759
A lackey truly has no shame.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.640
All offense, no defense.

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:03.960
You're the rabid dog.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.640
Everyone, quiet!

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.439
Dad.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.239
Why aren't you here yet?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.239
Did you go and cause trouble again?

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.079
Ran into a few guys in the way.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.439
You were at the Likasu family's hotel,

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.439
weren't you?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.120
Get your ass back here now.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.760
Okay.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.319
Zhao Fengsheng, right?

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:41.719
I'll remember you.

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:44.560
Let's go.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.400
I haven't had enough fun yet!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.359
Shengzi.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.000
Shengzi!

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.920
You're coughing up blood!

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.640
Go to the hospital.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.799
What blood?

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.359
That old geezer just kicked me by surprise.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.680
He made me spit out that expensive red wine

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.840
I was drinking.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.240
If you hadn't provoked Tang Huiyao,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.439
none of this would've happened!

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.240
You woman!

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.800
Bite the hand that feeds you.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.479
Can't be bothered with you.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.759
You...

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.479
Tianyu.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.199
Let's go.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:25.759
Hurry up, hurry!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.400
Protect Miss Qian for me!

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.360
All of you, protect Miss Qian!

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.560
Stop pretending.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.319
The milk comes after the baby's gone.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.599
Useless.

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.159
It's all because you angered Young Master Tang.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.120
If you hadn't been impulsive,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.599
there wouldn't have been a fight today.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.039
Coward.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.800
Tianyu, we're heading out.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:46.879
Ya...

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.800
Miss Qian.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.759
Are you alright?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.039
Should we take you to the hospital?

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.960
No need.

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.759
We've offended the Tang family this time.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.800
I need to go home and tell Dad,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.840
so he can be prepared.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.800
Mom

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.080
Shengzi hasn't been feeling well these past couple of days.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.319
I need to go take care of him.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.960
He's just a small-time hoodlum.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.080
Always getting into fights and brawls.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.120
How could you possibly take care of him?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.680
No,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.639
Shengzi did that for me back then.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.919
Don't you mention that good-for-nothing to me.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:19.719
Get inside, now.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.039
Old Buddha has something important to announce.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.520
Let's go.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.680
Old Buddha,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.919
what's happened exactly?

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.240
Why have you called everyone here?

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.000
Everyone, please take a seat.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.800
Sit, sit.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.560
Quick, have a seat.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.879
Everyone knows

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.599
Bian Shui is at the border of three Southeast Asian countries.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.520
Chinese people don't have much influence here.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.080
We neighbors

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.560
rely on doing a bit of small handicraft work

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.680
just to barely scrape by.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.879
Old Buddha is right about that.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.120
Auntie Wang gets up at five every day to do embroidery.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.840
Old Pang,

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.039
at his age,

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.400
pedals a broken tricycle every day

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.319
to deliver coal briquettes to rich families.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.120
The young people have no choice

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.360
but to go out and find work.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.840
We have no other way either.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.199
What you're talking about is all in the past.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.319
Manager Bai says

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.680
he can take all the businesses on our Old Street

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.959
and join the Qian Group's

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.160
Chinese Association.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.720
What's the Chinese Association?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.040
Yuchen,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.279
you explain it to everyone.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.040
Manager Bai,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.759
you tell us.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.720
Alright, alright.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.920
The Chinese Association

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.920
is actually a Chinese chamber of commerce

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.279
established by our Qian Group.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.120
It can help our neighbors

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.480
sell all their products.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.959
That's good.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.399
This is a good thing!

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.439
A good thing.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.160
Exactly, exactly.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.519
But,

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.000
we have to give up a little profit.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.319
Give up a little profit?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.639
How much profit?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.560
It's like this.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.360
According to the usual practice,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.839
you need to pay twenty percent of your profits.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:03.879
However,

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.560
we have Manager Bai speaking up for us.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.399
Now,

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:08.720
every month,

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.160
you only need to pay ten percent.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.199
Ten percent?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.480
Ten percent.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.959
Ten percent.

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:17.959
Ten percent is fine too.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.800
As long as we can sell all our goods,

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:22.040
it's okay if we work a little harder.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:23.800
That's right.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.079
I agree.

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.480
Then what are we waiting for?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.079
Let's join the association quickly.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.519
Manager Bai is really doing us a huge favor.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.720
Everyone, everyone, everyone.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.680
I can help everyone

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.680
apply for membership.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.000
It's just that,

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.199
our President Qian

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.360
pays great attention

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.639
to the Chinese Association's public reputation.

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.399
Things like child trafficking,

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.839
if they happen again,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.560
then no one's pleading will help.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120
Our Old Street,

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.120
it's Zhao Fengsheng who's causing trouble.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.879
At worst, we just kick him out. Darn it.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.600
Right?

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.879
Yes, that's right.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:01.920
Kick him out!

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.079
And Zhou Xiaoman too.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.240
Neighbors,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.279
who doesn't know she's a prostitute?

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.959
Zhao Fengsheng actually brought that kind of woman

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:09.879
back to the Old Street.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.839
It's a total slap in the face for the Old Street.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.839
Right!

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.279
Kick that woman out!

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.720
And that Da Gang too.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.360
He's always hanging around with that Zhao Fengsheng

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.000
and Zhou Xiaoman.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.360
He's no good either.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.199
That's right.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.319
I'm also one of the Four Pests of the Old Street.

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.519
You kick me out too!

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:26.639
Yaqing!

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:27.160
Er Ni!

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.160
You were just led astray by Zhao Fengsheng.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.480
If you don't associate with him,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.959
the neighbors won't blame you.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:32.600
Mom!

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.720
Yaqing.

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:35.319
Your mother makes a good point.

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:36.240
I know you're a

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.560
kind-hearted girl.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.079
But look at me.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.000
I work so hard

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.079
actually just to gain your approval.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:46.879
Manager Bai,

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.040
you want to become our Old Street's son-in-law, huh?

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:51.639
Er Ni,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.519
you see?

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:53.680
Such incredible good fortune

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.920
has fallen upon you.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.279
Why don't you have a nice chat

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.959
with our Manager Bai?

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.480
Tomorrow,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.399
tomorrow you two should go see a movie,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.120
have dinner,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.519
and have a proper blind date.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.399
Whoever wants to suck up to Bai Yuchen,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:11.480
go do it yourself.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.560
Don't drag me into it.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.879
Yaqing! Yaqing!

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.920
You wretched girl!

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.600
Auntie,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.639
Yuchen is the good son-in-law I've picked out.

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.279
Don't you get any funny ideas about him.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720
If you want Yuchen to become

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.240
our Old Street's son-in-law,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.319
first we have to kick out those scoundrels.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.360
Yes!

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.040
Drive out that pauper Zhao Fengsheng!

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.720
Yaqing will never escape my grasp again.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.480
Er Ni

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.399
Let's go.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.079
Elope.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.560
We'll take Da Gang too.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.560
And Zhou Xiaoman as well.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.839
We'll leave this place.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.319
The four of us will elope.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.240
Getting passionate at a time like this?

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.680
Alright then.

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.199
What's going on?

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800
You're not drunk, are you?

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.480
My mom insists on marrying me off to Bai Yuchen.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.360
And the neighbors want to kick you and Zhou Xiaoman...

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.439
...out of the Old Street.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.639
We might as well just leave.

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:22.399
Let's go.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.439
Dear neighbors...

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.240
Who's been feeding you lies again?

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.600
I'm going to talk to them.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.560
Er Ni!

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:32.559
Come out here!

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.399
Er Ni!

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.279
My mom's here.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.279
I need to go hide.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:39.799
Come out!

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.559
Talk nicely in a moment.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.559
Don't you dare lose your temper.

00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:42.600
Go hide then.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:47.919
Er Ni!

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.080
Come out here!

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:53.480
Come out here!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.639
Er Ni, you get out here!

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:02.720
I'll beat you to death!

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.399
Er Ni!

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.039
Open the door!

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:16.440
Xiaoman.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.759
Tell me...

00:09:17.759 --> 00:09:18.480
...how can we make...

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.039
...the neighbors believe Shengzi?

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.279
How about we drag Chen Xiaobei out and beat him up?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.080
Make him admit he's a kidnapper.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.279
Brother Gangzi.

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.840
Chen Xiaobei has too good a reputation on the Old Street.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:39.679
Unless we catch him red-handed...

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.799
...no one will probably believe it.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.840
Right.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.679
Let's go find them.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.799
Here they are.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.440
Just as I thought, hanging out with this bitch.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.080
What did I tell you?

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.879
Look! Look! Look!

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:51.960
What's the occasion today?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.279
So many people here for a bath?

00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.480
We're not here for a bath today.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:55.919
Right.

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:57.120
Not here for a bath.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.600
If not for a bath, why come to my bathhouse?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.399
The neighbors just want to ask you...

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.200
...if you even want to stay in the Old Street.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.039
What do you mean?

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.720
I, Da Gang, have lived in the Old Street for decades.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.759
Are you trying to kick me out?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.960
Manager Bai wants to lead all the neighbors...

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.000
...to join the Qian Group's Chinese Association.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.759
If you can sever ties with Zhao Fengsheng...

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:18.080
...and people like Zhou Xiaoman...

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.679
...the neighbors will let you stay.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.360
Yes.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.679
Exactly.

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.320
That's right.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.720
Correct.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.360
A woman like you staying in the Old Street...

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.240
...is an embarrassment to our Coal Mine Old Street.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.480
Yes, for joining the Chinese Association...

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.320
...she's an obstacle.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.279
Right, right, exactly.

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.360
Drag her out!

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:31.200
Get out!

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.000
Brother Gangzi!

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.240
Brother Gangzi!

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.399
What are you doing?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.879
What are you doing?!

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:36.919
Brother Gangzi!

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:37.960
Da Fo!

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.399
What are you trying to do?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.799
Da Gang.

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:42.720
The neighbors see you have a good heart...

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.960
...and want to give you a chance.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.039
Don't be ungrateful.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.960
Zhou Xiaoman has already left.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.639
As long as you go back to your Jin Family Ancestral Hall...

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.320
...and sever ties with Zhao Fengsheng...

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.960
...I promise the neighbors...

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.159
...won't say a single word against you.

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.960
I, Jin Jungang...

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.320
...and Shengzi are sworn brothers.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.440
Blood brothers.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.919
Wherever Shengzi is...

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.000
...that's my home.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.399
So what?

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:07.679
Want to start a fight?

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.399
Bring it on!

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:08.879
Come on!

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:09.200
Let's go!

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
You think I'm scared?

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.759
Start what fight?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.759
Isn't the Old Street chaotic enough?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.240
If you remain stubborn...

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.039
...from now on, your bathhouse...

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.039
...won't have a single customer.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.360
Let's see how you...

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.399
...survive in the Old Street then.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:24.919
Right.

00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:25.240
Yeah.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.279
This dump of a bathhouse...

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.279
...no one will come.

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.279
Think it over.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.399
Think carefully.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.720
Dad, let's go.

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:31.559
We're not coming back.

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.279
Let's go.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:33.240
Go, go, go.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.120
Never coming back.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.039
We'll never come again.

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:35.799
See how you survive.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.519
Exactly.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.639
Wait for it to go bankrupt.

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:38.320
I won't come either.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.679
It's just the Chinese Association.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:41.000
Why bully my brother?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.879
Shengzi.

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:45.480
They drove Xiaoman away.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.600
And they want me to cut ties with you.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.279
I heard everything.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.120
I'll handle it.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.639
What are you doing here?

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.919
Old Buddha.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.600
You want to drive me out of the Old Street.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.799
There are only two reasons.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.799
First...

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.679
...you think I kidnapped Xiaoxiao.

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:57.720
Second...

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.600
...Bai Yuchen says it's because of me...

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.960
...you can't join the Chinese Association.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.039
Right?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.799
These two things are the most important...

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:05.279
...issues for our Old Street.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.279
How can you still act so indifferent?

00:12:07.399 --> 00:12:09.720
That's because I'm completely innocent.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.960
I have a clear conscience.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.120
Xiaoxiao was you...

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.080
...Auntie Feng.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.279
Even a convicted criminal...

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.879
...can hire a lawyer to appeal.

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:19.399
You can't just call me a kidnapper based on guesses.

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:20.679
That's not right, is it?

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.440
That's true.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.000
You can't just listen to Bai Yuchen's nonsense.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.000
Old Buddha.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.480
I know you're tight on money...

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.440
...because of saving Xiaoxiao.

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:32.159
Saving Xiaoxiao is one thing...

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.000
...but we also need to earn a living.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.360
Otherwise, if another child gets poisoned...

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.200
...how will we pay the hospital?

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.200
Yes.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.639
I know you don't trust me yet.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:42.559
That's fine.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.320
The truth will come out when Xiaoxiao wakes up.

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:47.159
Don't just sweet-talk us.

00:12:47.159 --> 00:12:48.320
You probably wish my child...

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.039
Da Fo.

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:51.039
Whether it's saving Xiaoxiao...

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.600
...or clearing up your misunderstanding of me...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.360
...I, Zhao Fengsheng, am willing to do it.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:56.840
As for the Chinese Association matter...

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:57.919
...I'll handle it.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.879
Brother.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:00.879
That's the spirit.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.440
Damn right.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.240
You'll handle it?

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:03.639
What do you mean?

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:05.360
It means...

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.759
...without going through Bai Yuchen...

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:08.879
...I can get everyone to join immediately...

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:09.679
...the Chinese Association.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.799
You?

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:12.120
Do you even know Manager Bai...

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.840
And what's more...

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.279
...no one has to hand over any profits.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.200
This... can't be.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.279
Impossible.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.080
Not even ten percent profit?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.679
You're just...

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:21.159
...you're just bragging to us.

00:13:21.159 --> 00:13:21.919
Bragging.

00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:25.480
If I can't handle such a small matter...

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.080
...then my years abroad...

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.279
...would have been a complete waste.

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:31.960
Is what he said true or not?

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:34.039
Is he even reliable, looking like that?

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:34.639
What's the rush?

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:35.639
One or two more days won't make a difference.

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:36.679
Right.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.039
How about...

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.840
we let him try?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.679
With his sloppy, carefree attitude,

00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:43.799
is he reliable?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.759
But we can't just keep waiting forever.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:46.799
Neighbors,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.000
just give me three days.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.720
If I, Zhao Fengsheng, can't do it,

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:52.639
I'll pack up and get out of the Old Street immediately.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.279
Three days.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.679
Give him three days to try.

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:55.559
Fine.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.679
I'll give you three days.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.399
Good.

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.600
If you fail,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.320
don't blame the neighbors for being unkind.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:03.480
Deal.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.240
Let's go, go, go.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.799
Take care on your way, neighbors.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.960
Watch your step.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.080
Not bad, Shengzi.

00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:17.600
Your bragging skills have improved.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.159
Who's bragging?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.440
Three days is enough for us

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.720
to pack up and run away.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.720
What was that place you went abroad to called again?

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.519
Your big brother here

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.720
has saved up a bit of a marriage fund.

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:27.679
We'll bring Xiaoman along,

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.519
for the journey.

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.080
Why are you on the same page as Er Ni?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.360
It's just a matter of one phone call.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.480
Why would we need to run away?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.440
Wait here.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.000
Are you talking about...

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.799
the Chinese Association?

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:38.360
Hurry up.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.320
Get me some change.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.159
Your brother needs to make a call.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.080
You don't even have a dime and you're still bragging.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.840
You only have one yuan yourself.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.399
Just wait and see.

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:53.559
Where's my lighter?

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:03.360
President Li.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.120
The head of the Jin family invites you to dinner tonight.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.279
To discuss the matter of the seven-hundred-acre rubber plantation.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.639
For matters of ten or twenty million in the future,

00:15:09.639 --> 00:15:10.840
you can decide for yourself.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.600
Understood.

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.240
Whoever you are,

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.759
I'm only giving you ten seconds.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.759
Er Leng?

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:20.399
Is that you or not?

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.559
Boss!

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:25.440
It's me.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.519
It's Er Leng!

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.879
You finally called me!
