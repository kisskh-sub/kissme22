00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:04.384
(Episode 44)

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:07.284
Always leave an escape route, even when you're cornering a rat.

00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:09.554
Does he really think I'll just get on my knees and beg?

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:23.034
(Files on Ji Eun Oh)

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:24.404
(Hyeonyu Department Store, Cheongju Orphanage)

00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:38.914
What on earth happened?

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:41.184
This can't be right.

00:00:44.554 --> 00:00:45.554
Park Jin Seok?

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:50.094
How did he find out about this?

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:14.014
But why did he leave this one untouched?

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:19.894
Honey, if I die suddenly, the safe code is our anniversary.

00:01:21.524 --> 00:01:23.624
So he left the one I gave him the code to...

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:27.394
and only cleaned out my secret safe?

00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:57.794
Park Jin Seok!

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:17.684
My ID,

00:02:18.514 --> 00:02:21.084
my official seal, even all my bankbooks.

00:02:23.954 --> 00:02:24.994
Park Jin Seok.

00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:27.494
What in the world are you trying to pull?

00:02:28.154 --> 00:02:29.324
What is this supposed to mean?

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:31.494
What are you up to?

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:40.504
He must've cleaned this out this morning.

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:47.874
Missus.

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:52.514
Was the Chairman here yesterday afternoon?

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:53.514
Yes. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:56.824
I'm sure he told you to keep your mouth shut.

00:02:58.054 --> 00:02:59.354
I bet he told you not to say anything...

00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:01.724
about who he came with and what he did here.

00:03:03.124 --> 00:03:04.424
And if I asked whether he had been here,

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:06.064
he told you to confirm that and nothing more?

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:08.264
Yes.

00:03:26.284 --> 00:03:27.514
Stop crying, man.

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:29.424
I can't leave with you carrying on like this.

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:33.054
- Hey, this is my office. - I'm just in shock.

00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:38.534
Tell me about it.

00:03:42.534 --> 00:03:43.634
What about your parents?

00:03:45.874 --> 00:03:47.034
Do they know?

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:49.204
No.

00:03:50.074 --> 00:03:53.514
I planned to tell you in a few days, though.

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:55.784
Because I need your help.

00:03:57.614 --> 00:03:58.814
But other than you,

00:03:59.754 --> 00:04:01.184
I'm not telling anyone else.

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:05.054
What are you talking about? You have to tell your family.

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:07.394
If my family finds out, they'll be devastated,

00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:13.264
and my parents will force me to quit and just focus on treatment.

00:04:13.734 --> 00:04:14.994
Of course, they would.

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:18.064
You have to quit your job and get treatment, Ji Hyuk.

00:04:18.874 --> 00:04:20.434
That's exactly why I'm hiding it.

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:23.104
Even if I get treatment,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:25.674
the only endgame is a heart transplant,

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:27.244
and the waiting list is way too long.

00:04:28.214 --> 00:04:30.684
They said even with treatment, I could collapse at any time.

00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:33.384
There are no guarantees, Seong Jae.

00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:34.784
But still...

00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:37.984
I...

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:41.524
refuse to live my life just waiting for a heart transplant.

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:46.864
- Then you're just going to... - Die soon? Is that what you mean?

00:04:47.794 --> 00:04:48.804
And you're not going to die?

00:04:49.064 --> 00:04:52.774
- We all die. The question is when. - But...

00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:55.344
You know,

00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:58.844
when I went to Cheongpo after my wedding was called off,

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:02.044
I already died once back then.

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:08.254
It felt like I'd just ceased to exist.

00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:12.294
But you brought that on yourself.

00:05:13.224 --> 00:05:14.724
I'm telling you. It made me miserable.

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:19.794
It wasn't really living.

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:24.164
I realized that life doesn't go the way you plan.

00:05:25.474 --> 00:05:26.704
I learned that the hard way.

00:05:31.074 --> 00:05:32.714
So what are you trying to say?

00:05:35.144 --> 00:05:37.014
You don't get what I'm saying, do you?

00:05:38.084 --> 00:05:40.114
You're not in my shoes, so you'll never understand.

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.024
My family wouldn't get it either.

00:05:45.524 --> 00:05:47.424
So what is it you want to do?

00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:50.494
To keep living just like I am now.

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:54.164
Waiting around for a heart that might never come,

00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:56.164
constantly hoping that maybe,

00:05:57.504 --> 00:05:58.574
just maybe...

00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:01.274
I refuse to live like that.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:05.714
I want to keep working as if nothing's happened,

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:10.144
eat meals, and laugh with my family...

00:06:10.914 --> 00:06:12.314
That's how I want to live.

00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:14.484
By lying to your parents and siblings?

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.594
- Yes. - Man, how could you do that?

00:06:20.554 --> 00:06:21.724
And why not?

00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:24.624
I'm the one who's dying here.

00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:28.834
What's left of my life is more important.

00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:32.134
I don't want those I leave behind...

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:35.404
to be sad and heartbroken over me.

00:06:37.044 --> 00:06:38.144
And because of that,

00:06:39.414 --> 00:06:42.114
they can't even live their own lives properly.

00:06:43.744 --> 00:06:45.014
Darn it...

00:06:46.184 --> 00:06:48.414
Do I really have to die with everyone pitying me?

00:06:51.894 --> 00:06:54.894
When one of my dad's friends passed away,

00:06:56.524 --> 00:06:58.124
my dad told me something.

00:06:59.734 --> 00:07:01.534
There might be an order to when we're born,

00:07:02.404 --> 00:07:04.164
but there's no order to when we die.

00:07:06.874 --> 00:07:08.004
Come on, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:11.874
Don't you think you're giving up too easily?

00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:14.714
Man, you just don't get it, do you?

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:17.214
Hey, look.

00:07:17.944 --> 00:07:19.384
I just want to live for today.

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:23.584
So please,

00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:27.354
keep this a secret from everyone.

00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:32.334
Even from Eun Oh.

00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:43.304
I'll have to think about it.

00:07:44.104 --> 00:07:45.144
Don't think about it.

00:07:47.444 --> 00:07:48.714
I've already made my decision.

00:07:49.814 --> 00:07:51.084
Darn it.

00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:57.454
Hey, do you think making a decision like this...

00:07:57.884 --> 00:07:59.154
was easy for me?

00:08:08.464 --> 00:08:09.464
Darn...

00:08:20.444 --> 00:08:24.784
He didn't let on, then cleaned out my private safe yesterday afternoon.

00:08:25.684 --> 00:08:28.754
This morning, while I was right here in the house, he hit the main one.

00:08:28.754 --> 00:08:29.954
He cleaned it out completely.

00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:32.494
So, he wants me to beg.

00:08:33.354 --> 00:08:36.764
He robbed me blind to show me how angry he is,

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:38.664
and I should just raise a white flag and surrender?

00:09:20.034 --> 00:09:23.074
Gosh, I'm starving. I shouldn't have skipped lunch.

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:26.544
What? What's this?

00:09:28.714 --> 00:09:30.684
Don't come home before 10pm.

00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:32.614
Are we having guests?

00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:36.884
Did Dad find out something about Mom?

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:40.394
No, it's better not to know.

00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:43.094
What I don't know can't hurt me.

00:09:44.464 --> 00:09:45.734
I'm so hungry.

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:48.334
What should I eat today?

00:09:58.504 --> 00:09:59.874
Why does this taste so bland?

00:10:01.244 --> 00:10:03.544
I made it the exact same way Ji Wan does.

00:10:07.684 --> 00:10:10.024
I guess ramyeon doesn't taste as good when you eat it alone.

00:10:14.124 --> 00:10:16.394
I wish Ji Wan were here to make it for me.

00:10:24.734 --> 00:10:26.974
You're a PE graduate with a black belt...

00:10:27.434 --> 00:10:29.044
and have experience in VIP protection?

00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:32.674
- Yes. - So why personal security?

00:10:33.344 --> 00:10:34.674
I've learned that this line of work...

00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:37.314
isn't just about physically guarding someone.

00:10:37.714 --> 00:10:41.754
It's protecting their daily life and their peace of mind.

00:10:42.354 --> 00:10:44.884
I want to be able to protect someone's life...

00:10:45.494 --> 00:10:47.754
and be a source of support for them.

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:50.064
(Interviewer)

00:10:50.124 --> 00:10:53.664
That all sounds great, but our company is team-oriented,

00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:55.504
and your lack of team experience is a concern.

00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:01.804
(Conference Room 2)

00:11:01.874 --> 00:11:04.804
I learned more than I realized from protecting Yeong Ra.

00:11:05.674 --> 00:11:06.714
Mr. Lee Ji Wan!

00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:09.614
Yes?

00:11:10.284 --> 00:11:12.554
We're impressed with your VIP protection experience.

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:15.624
However, we'll need verification that you performed those duties.

00:11:16.324 --> 00:11:18.124
You were the bodyguard for Shoe Joy's daughter, right?

00:11:19.094 --> 00:11:20.824
Could you get a recommendation letter from her?

00:11:21.424 --> 00:11:25.394
- A recommendation letter? - Submit that, and the job is yours.

00:11:29.364 --> 00:11:31.734
Get a recommendation letter from Yeong Ra?

00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:34.234
Gosh, how humiliating.

00:11:35.204 --> 00:11:39.314
I hoped I'd never see her again. How can I go back and ask her?

00:11:42.144 --> 00:11:44.144
Darn it. No way. I'm not going.

00:11:47.454 --> 00:11:48.554
So refreshing.

00:11:50.354 --> 00:11:51.724
This is amazing.

00:11:52.224 --> 00:11:54.554
I can't believe how different today feels from yesterday.

00:11:55.794 --> 00:11:57.424
This is what true freedom feels like.

00:11:58.894 --> 00:12:01.694
This is the first time in my life I am doing things alone.

00:12:03.704 --> 00:12:05.834
This kind of freedom...

00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:22.354
But I guess it can be a little boring, too.

00:12:22.984 --> 00:12:23.984
This thing called freedom.

00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:31.494
Gosh, a man's got to eat, but this is...

00:12:32.064 --> 00:12:34.634
I was going to set up her security camera,

00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:36.164
so I guess this is good timing.

00:12:37.004 --> 00:12:39.334
If it weren't a rooftop room, I wouldn't even care.

00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:43.344
What? That's Yeong Ra.

00:12:44.604 --> 00:12:47.774
- You must live around here. - What? Does she know him?

00:12:48.414 --> 00:12:50.984
I was just passing by, and honestly, you're totally my type.

00:12:51.514 --> 00:12:53.284
Could I maybe get your number?

00:12:55.784 --> 00:12:57.984
So, you're asking for my number.

00:12:57.984 --> 00:12:59.654
- Right? - What?

00:13:00.924 --> 00:13:02.894
Yes. You're totally my type.

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:09.804
I left my phone at home. Let me type my number in yours.

00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:11.364
Sure, here you go.

00:13:12.474 --> 00:13:13.774
Hey, Park Yeong Ra!

00:13:17.474 --> 00:13:18.474
Ji Wan!

00:13:19.614 --> 00:13:22.014
What? You have a boyfriend?

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:29.724
Ji Wan! Hey, what are you doing here?

00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.154
Did you come to see me?

00:13:31.224 --> 00:13:33.524
Yeong Ra, after that stalker, you're still not afraid?

00:13:33.594 --> 00:13:35.524
Don't you use the Internet or YouTube?

00:13:35.524 --> 00:13:37.564
Why give your number to a stranger?

00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.464
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:13:39.764 --> 00:13:41.394
I was going to give him a fake number.

00:13:42.804 --> 00:13:43.804
What?

00:13:44.404 --> 00:13:46.404
You were going to give him a fake number?

00:13:46.474 --> 00:13:48.834
Yes. Who goes anywhere without their phone?

00:13:48.944 --> 00:13:50.674
My phone's right here in my pocket.

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:08.124
But why give him a fake number?

00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:11.164
I've never been hit on in public, so I wanted to see what it was like.

00:14:12.024 --> 00:14:15.464
Sure, plenty of guys would hit on me with notes or texts in school,

00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:18.604
but this is my first time being asked for my number on the street.

00:14:20.504 --> 00:14:22.074
As a webtoon artist,

00:14:22.344 --> 00:14:23.644
I wanted to experience it for myself.

00:14:24.144 --> 00:14:26.444
Besides, I have a taser in my other pocket.

00:14:28.544 --> 00:14:31.314
Oh, I see.

00:14:32.414 --> 00:14:35.954
Why did you come running and yelling like it was the end of the world?

00:14:36.954 --> 00:14:39.254
I guess my bodyguard instincts are still kicking in.

00:14:42.724 --> 00:14:44.724
Anyway, Ji Wan, why are you here?

00:14:45.624 --> 00:14:48.134
This... I came to install a security camera...

00:14:48.134 --> 00:14:49.534
by your front door.

00:14:49.904 --> 00:14:53.504
And since I was coming anyway, there's something I need from you.

00:14:54.004 --> 00:14:55.074
What is it?

00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:59.274
Is that right? Sure, I'll write you one.

00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:00.874
You will?

00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:03.544
On one condition. Be my webtoon assistant for one day.

00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:06.884
Of course. I knew there'd be a catch.

00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:10.954
They say there's no such thing as a free lunch.

00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:16.764
All right. Since I'm already here, what do you need me to do first?

00:15:17.524 --> 00:15:18.694
(Letter of Recommendation, Name: Lee Ji Wan)

00:15:18.764 --> 00:15:20.734
(During his time as my bodyguard, Mr. Lee was always vigilant...)

00:15:23.864 --> 00:15:25.604
While I write this recommendation letter,

00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:28.374
could you take a look at my story notes?

00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:39.414
Here. Your recommendation letter.

00:15:43.724 --> 00:15:44.724
Thanks.

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:46.654
Thank you, too.

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:49.624
Thanks to you, the intro is much more interesting.

00:15:49.924 --> 00:15:52.364
Not at all. It's all based on your experiences.

00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:55.464
But you helped me draw all of those memories out.

00:15:57.864 --> 00:15:59.204
So, about that...

00:16:00.374 --> 00:16:02.544
Aren't you having fun working on webtoons, too?

00:16:03.904 --> 00:16:04.904
Yes, it's fun.

00:16:05.844 --> 00:16:08.344
Then why don't you work with me on this webtoon?

00:16:09.044 --> 00:16:11.514
You write the story, and I'll do the drawing.

00:16:12.684 --> 00:16:14.714
You want us to work on it together?

00:16:15.314 --> 00:16:18.954
Yes. Not just as a favor, but a full-on collaboration.

00:16:19.754 --> 00:16:21.694
Many other creators work like this, you know.

00:16:26.864 --> 00:16:30.004
No. I want to follow my own path.

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:37.244
So you really do want to be a bodyguard.

00:16:38.144 --> 00:16:40.174
You'll do great on your own.

00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:44.544
I'm heading out.

00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:50.654
And before you leave, make sure to check the security camera.

00:17:04.764 --> 00:17:06.174
He shot me down flat.

00:17:07.304 --> 00:17:08.734
Without even a hint of hesitation.

00:17:14.174 --> 00:17:15.984
Don't come home before 10pm.

00:17:17.184 --> 00:17:18.614
Maybe I should call Mom.

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:21.554
No.

00:17:21.914 --> 00:17:24.124
If something was wrong, she would've called me by now.

00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:27.894
I wonder if they're fighting.

00:17:29.964 --> 00:17:31.994
What am I going to do about Ji Hyuk's parents?

00:17:33.864 --> 00:17:36.064
What am I going to do about Su Bin?

00:17:36.134 --> 00:17:38.064
(Vice President Park Seong Jae)

00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:42.174
Don't come home before 10pm.

00:17:46.114 --> 00:17:47.144
Before 10pm?

00:17:50.144 --> 00:17:52.714
Is he finally going to have it out with her?

00:18:01.054 --> 00:18:02.054
What is this?

00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:04.294
Honey.

00:18:04.824 --> 00:18:06.034
What do you want to do with me?

00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:08.694
What is it that you want?

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:12.164
I said I didn't want to see you when I got home, didn't I?

00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:15.504
My gosh. Honey, what's gotten into you?

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:20.574
Why? Why are you doing this? Let go. Let go of me! Honey!

00:18:21.444 --> 00:18:23.114
- Honey, please! - Come on!

00:18:23.114 --> 00:18:25.014
What are you doing? This is wrong!

00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:28.084
Honey.

00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:30.024
Honey.

00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:38.324
Honey!

00:18:38.764 --> 00:18:42.564
Honey! Darn it!

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:44.234
That jerk has lost his mind.

00:18:46.574 --> 00:18:49.674
No shoes and no phone, in the middle of winter.

00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:54.644
How could he treat me like this, no matter how angry he is?

00:19:03.224 --> 00:19:04.984
(Incorrect Password)

00:19:05.054 --> 00:19:06.054
What the...

00:19:09.994 --> 00:19:11.094
(Incorrect Password)

00:19:13.064 --> 00:19:14.134
That crazy jerk.

00:19:14.734 --> 00:19:16.064
He changed the passcode, too.

00:19:27.744 --> 00:19:28.744
Hi...

00:19:39.254 --> 00:19:40.294
Missus.

00:19:43.794 --> 00:19:44.794
Right.

00:19:45.624 --> 00:19:47.234
She probably told her to leave.

00:20:32.144 --> 00:20:33.144
Mom?

00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:35.974
Yeong Ra!

00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:40.684
You know the new passcode, don't you? Open the door, quick.

00:20:40.754 --> 00:20:41.854
I'm freezing to death out here.

00:20:42.724 --> 00:20:45.224
- Mom, did Dad find out? - He did.

00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:48.424
Seong Jae ratted me out. He found out everything.

00:20:48.624 --> 00:20:50.094
That brat told him every single thing.

00:20:51.464 --> 00:20:52.994
Come on. Hurry up and open the door.

00:20:54.964 --> 00:20:56.064
Wait here.

00:20:56.364 --> 00:20:57.364
What?

00:20:58.434 --> 00:21:01.934
Dad texted me and told me to come home after 10pm.

00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:04.474
But something felt off, so I came home early.

00:21:05.574 --> 00:21:07.074
I called Dad on my way over,

00:21:09.644 --> 00:21:12.514
and he said under no circumstances was I to come in with you.

00:21:13.614 --> 00:21:14.654
He said what?

00:21:20.994 --> 00:21:22.524
Here, at least put this on.

00:21:23.464 --> 00:21:25.564
I'm going to go in and hear Dad out first.

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:30.004
Hey! Park Yeong Ra!

00:21:30.934 --> 00:21:32.664
Mom, if you come in with me right now,

00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:35.204
are you sure you won't get thrown out again?

00:21:44.344 --> 00:21:45.344
Dad.

00:21:48.214 --> 00:21:50.054
Why did you come home early? Don't you listen?

00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:52.894
I told you to come home after 10pm.

00:21:53.424 --> 00:21:56.624
Were you just going to leave Mom out there until 10pm?

00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:02.294
You knew something, didn't you?

00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:08.204
I knew that Woo Jin got a liver transplant.

00:22:10.944 --> 00:22:12.504
And you didn't tell me?

00:22:14.114 --> 00:22:15.214
All of you.

00:22:17.214 --> 00:22:18.914
Do you take me for a fool?

00:22:19.454 --> 00:22:20.884
How was I supposed to tell you?

00:22:21.454 --> 00:22:23.824
You love and adore Mom so much.

00:22:27.094 --> 00:22:29.154
I see now. The way I've lived is your excuse.

00:22:32.624 --> 00:22:34.134
What are you going to do about Mom?

00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.034
She's not even wearing any shoes.

00:22:38.134 --> 00:22:39.734
You can't just leave her out there like that.

00:22:43.374 --> 00:22:46.474
That's because your mother sent all the housekeepers away.

00:22:48.074 --> 00:22:50.484
If someone were here, I'd have had them brought to her.

00:22:51.684 --> 00:22:52.684
Brought her what?

00:22:56.524 --> 00:22:58.024
Take those to her along with a pair of shoes.

00:23:02.154 --> 00:23:03.164
Dad.

00:23:05.294 --> 00:23:07.464
Give those to your mother and come back inside by yourself.

00:23:08.134 --> 00:23:09.734
And don't dare give her your card or any cash.

00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:12.234
As for why I'm doing this,

00:23:13.504 --> 00:23:14.904
I'll explain when you come back inside.

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:33.994
Dad told me to give you these.

00:23:44.434 --> 00:23:46.404
Your phone is in the bag.

00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:49.204
Did he say anything else?

00:23:51.344 --> 00:23:54.544
He said he'd explain things to me if I came back inside alone.

00:23:56.174 --> 00:23:57.184
That crazy piece of...

00:23:57.844 --> 00:23:59.184
The nerve of him.

00:23:59.814 --> 00:24:02.414
He robs me blind and has the gall to throw me out?

00:24:05.454 --> 00:24:06.524
Give me the car keys.

00:24:07.494 --> 00:24:08.494
I don't have them.

00:24:09.324 --> 00:24:10.994
Dad told me to leave the keys before I came out.

00:24:15.664 --> 00:24:18.404
Mom. What are you going to do now?

00:24:27.044 --> 00:24:28.044
I'll handle it myself.

00:24:39.724 --> 00:24:41.594
(Hotel)

00:24:45.664 --> 00:24:47.964
I haven't eaten all day. I'm getting light-headed.

00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:10.024
To me... How could he do this to me?

00:25:12.624 --> 00:25:14.294
I will not take this lying down.

00:25:18.124 --> 00:25:20.464
He thinks I can't sell the building without the deed?

00:25:22.494 --> 00:25:26.064
He must have thought I'd just tremble in fear.

00:25:27.574 --> 00:25:30.074
That I'm just some clueless woman,

00:25:31.474 --> 00:25:32.944
ignorant of how the world works. Is that it?

00:25:54.394 --> 00:25:55.464
Go upstairs.

00:26:21.324 --> 00:26:23.464
Barefoot? Really?

00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.694
He probably knows who gave Woo Jin the liver transplant.

00:26:27.994 --> 00:26:29.664
Mom said he found out everything.

00:26:31.164 --> 00:26:34.074
Then does he also know about Ji Eun Oh's death certificate?

00:26:35.574 --> 00:26:38.204
Did Dad say anything about what else he knows?

00:26:39.274 --> 00:26:42.074
He said he'd explain after I sent Mom away,

00:26:42.474 --> 00:26:44.644
but then he just said we'd talk about it later.

00:26:47.214 --> 00:26:48.214
But honestly,

00:26:48.754 --> 00:26:50.554
I didn't even want to know any more.

00:26:51.324 --> 00:26:52.854
I was scared...

00:26:53.494 --> 00:26:54.494
of what else there might be.

00:26:56.464 --> 00:26:59.194
That must've been hard on you. It still is.

00:27:00.364 --> 00:27:03.264
Seong Jae, I'm trying to be okay.

00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:05.134
What?

00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:07.474
I want to be okay with this.

00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:11.444
All this time, Mom has lived life on her own terms.

00:27:11.674 --> 00:27:13.374
And she's controlled my life too.

00:27:14.944 --> 00:27:17.614
That's why I want to get out from under her thumb now.

00:27:20.454 --> 00:27:22.814
- Yeong Ra. - I'm so sorry, Seong Jae.

00:27:23.854 --> 00:27:25.684
I'm sorry our mom is the person she is.

00:27:39.204 --> 00:27:40.704
"The person she is..."

00:27:41.934 --> 00:27:43.504
Why should you be the one to apologize?

00:27:52.384 --> 00:27:53.514
No.

00:27:54.054 --> 00:27:56.624
Don't think about Mom. Don't waver.

00:28:04.094 --> 00:28:06.224
I wish I could tell Ji Wan.

00:28:11.404 --> 00:28:13.204
(Letter of Recommendation)

00:28:13.204 --> 00:28:15.804
During his time as my bodyguard, Mr. Lee Ji Wan...

00:28:15.874 --> 00:28:18.574
never once let his guard down.

00:28:19.474 --> 00:28:21.844
He was protecting me from a stalker,

00:28:22.074 --> 00:28:25.544
but he was so considerate of my feelings and well-being...

00:28:25.944 --> 00:28:29.184
that it felt like he was guarding my entire life.

00:28:30.084 --> 00:28:32.254
He's reliable and upstanding,

00:28:32.424 --> 00:28:35.194
always looking out for me and giving me advice,

00:28:35.654 --> 00:28:37.624
and he's a kind and caring person.

00:28:39.724 --> 00:28:42.394
Whoever gets to have Mr. Lee as their bodyguard next,

00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:47.204
I hope they know they're very lucky to have him in their life.

00:28:53.044 --> 00:28:54.614
Am I really like that?

00:29:33.954 --> 00:29:35.314
What's taking him so long?

00:29:35.654 --> 00:29:37.654
He used to get here at 7:30am on the dot.

00:29:53.164 --> 00:29:54.704
It's all cold now.

00:29:57.004 --> 00:29:58.604
Seriously, what is he doing?

00:30:02.644 --> 00:30:03.784
Ji Hyuk.

00:30:06.754 --> 00:30:09.014
What took you so long?

00:30:10.424 --> 00:30:11.784
It's not even 9am yet.

00:30:12.984 --> 00:30:14.054
I mean...

00:30:14.794 --> 00:30:16.894
But you're always here so early.

00:30:17.694 --> 00:30:18.924
People can change.

00:30:21.734 --> 00:30:23.234
Do I need to get your permission to change?

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:28.704
(CEO's Office)

00:30:32.344 --> 00:30:33.814
Gosh, what's with him?

00:30:39.314 --> 00:30:40.484
Yes, that's right.

00:30:40.754 --> 00:30:45.624
I need to hire protection for three. But they can't know about it.

00:30:47.824 --> 00:30:51.294
I don't mean tailing them. There's a dangerous person involved.

00:30:51.924 --> 00:30:54.864
I'm worried the family will panic if they find out,

00:30:55.434 --> 00:30:57.404
so I want them protected discreetly.

00:30:58.534 --> 00:31:00.704
Their names are Ji Eun Oh and Ji Gang Oh.

00:31:01.074 --> 00:31:03.474
I'll give you the third name when I send the address.

00:31:05.444 --> 00:31:06.544
Okay, understood.

00:31:12.084 --> 00:31:14.084
(Eun Oh)

00:31:17.384 --> 00:31:19.424
What is it? Is something wrong?

00:31:19.954 --> 00:31:22.094
Why do you sound so startled to hear from me?

00:31:22.824 --> 00:31:23.824
What?

00:31:24.094 --> 00:31:26.834
Am I not allowed to call you either?

00:31:27.394 --> 00:31:30.264
"You either?" Did someone tell you not to call them?

00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:32.034
No, that's not it.

00:31:33.374 --> 00:31:36.104
I was just calling to see if something was wrong with Ji Hyuk.

00:31:37.544 --> 00:31:38.704
By any chance,

00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:43.174
is Ji Hyuk in some kind of trouble? Something work-related?

00:31:44.914 --> 00:31:48.554
I've been a bit busy myself, so I haven't talked to Ji Hyuk.

00:31:51.954 --> 00:31:54.954
So I guess nothing's wrong then?

00:31:55.794 --> 00:31:57.764
But why do you ask?

00:31:58.364 --> 00:31:59.364
It's just that...

00:32:00.434 --> 00:32:04.464
Ever since he got back from Tokyo, he's been acting strange toward me.

00:32:05.164 --> 00:32:07.604
He came back a completely different person.

00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:10.344
A different person?

00:32:11.574 --> 00:32:13.044
It seems like it's just with me...

00:32:16.344 --> 00:32:17.344
Actually...

00:32:18.044 --> 00:32:19.314
Never mind.

00:32:19.984 --> 00:32:21.384
If you say nothing's wrong, then it's fine.

00:32:22.314 --> 00:32:23.354
I'll let you go, then.

00:32:40.434 --> 00:32:43.304
Hey, I didn't say you could come in.

00:32:46.344 --> 00:32:49.144
Ji Hyuk, why are you being like this to me?

00:32:49.574 --> 00:32:51.614
The way you replied to my text, too.

00:32:51.914 --> 00:32:55.314
Is there a big problem at work or something?

00:32:55.684 --> 00:32:58.754
- Is that why you're so sensitive? - Say there's a big problem at work.

00:32:59.124 --> 00:33:02.054
Why would I take it out on you?

00:33:02.924 --> 00:33:05.694
What would company business have to do with you?

00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:12.704
You really have to ask?

00:33:15.674 --> 00:33:17.144
Are you asking that...

00:33:17.904 --> 00:33:20.514
based on my personal feelings for you?

00:33:20.874 --> 00:33:22.114
Of course, I am.

00:33:22.614 --> 00:33:24.244
You told me you liked me.

00:33:28.684 --> 00:33:30.984
Something's come up at work.

00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:33.694
And I'm not going to tell you what it is.

00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:36.224
We're not at the point where I share company secrets.

00:33:37.694 --> 00:33:39.864
I'm not asking for company secrets.

00:33:40.194 --> 00:33:42.334
I'm asking why you're treating me differently.

00:33:43.734 --> 00:33:45.104
I'm so preoccupied,

00:33:45.904 --> 00:33:47.774
I can't even think about my own feelings.

00:33:49.674 --> 00:33:50.844
I don't have the bandwidth to be considerate...

00:33:53.044 --> 00:33:54.244
or worry about anyone else.

00:33:58.584 --> 00:34:00.384
Is work really that...

00:34:00.784 --> 00:34:03.414
Right. I have an important conference call.

00:34:03.884 --> 00:34:04.884
It's in three minutes.

00:34:14.464 --> 00:34:15.464
Okay.

00:34:25.104 --> 00:34:26.544
I wonder what's going on at the company.

00:34:28.174 --> 00:34:30.314
Gosh, what was I thinking?

00:34:30.944 --> 00:34:35.214
He's so overwhelmed with work, and I'm just clinging to him.

00:34:42.724 --> 00:34:43.924
I'm being so needy,

00:34:45.224 --> 00:34:46.224
getting all upset.

00:34:48.334 --> 00:34:50.064
As if we were a couple or something.

00:34:51.664 --> 00:34:53.264
But we're not.

00:34:53.904 --> 00:34:54.974
Not yet.

00:34:58.074 --> 00:34:59.704
Then why am I so hurt?

00:35:07.384 --> 00:35:08.784
(Made to Your Taste Project)

00:35:10.114 --> 00:35:11.924
(30 Houses: Image House)

00:35:17.624 --> 00:35:19.764
(Kim Dong Su)

00:35:19.824 --> 00:35:21.594
(Chairman Kim Dong Su, Former AP Chairman)

00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:28.374
Hello, sir. I hope you've been well.

00:35:30.444 --> 00:35:32.904
There's something I'd like to consult you on.

00:35:33.644 --> 00:35:35.274
When would be a good time for you?

00:35:38.944 --> 00:35:41.154
Me? Doing so well I don't need your advice?

00:35:42.684 --> 00:35:43.754
I'm only just getting used to things...

00:35:45.684 --> 00:35:46.854
and finding my footing.

00:35:50.124 --> 00:35:52.294
You want to quick-sell the Apgujeong apartment?

00:35:53.264 --> 00:35:54.894
The Cheongdam-dong condo is also an option.

00:35:55.294 --> 00:35:56.534
Just sell whichever one goes first.

00:35:57.304 --> 00:35:58.864
List it for ten percent below market value.

00:35:59.264 --> 00:36:02.174
Get me a deposit within one week, and I'll double your commission.

00:36:03.404 --> 00:36:06.844
The Apgujeong apartment has a buyer ready to sign now.

00:36:06.974 --> 00:36:08.474
I'll give them a call right away,

00:36:08.774 --> 00:36:11.444
so why don't you wait a little and sign the contract before you go?

00:36:13.344 --> 00:36:15.884
Fine. As long as they can come right now.

00:36:22.194 --> 00:36:23.194
Ma'am.

00:36:23.624 --> 00:36:26.464
You should have told me about the mortgage on it.

00:36:27.294 --> 00:36:28.594
You already knew about that one.

00:36:28.894 --> 00:36:30.334
I'm not talking about the bank loan.

00:36:30.964 --> 00:36:32.764
You've taken out an additional mortgage.

00:36:33.204 --> 00:36:36.634
That has to be paid off first before the sale can go through.

00:36:37.604 --> 00:36:39.174
An additional mortgage? What are you talking about?

00:36:42.574 --> 00:36:43.574
Right here.

00:36:44.384 --> 00:36:47.114
An additional 3.3 million dollars was taken out against it.

00:36:49.514 --> 00:36:51.424
(3.3 million dollars, Creditor: Park Jin Seok)

00:36:53.724 --> 00:36:55.554
(Debtor: Ko Seong Hui, Mortgagee: Park Jin Seok)

00:36:59.064 --> 00:37:02.634
My gosh. The Cheongdam-dong condo has another mortgage on it, too.

00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:06.304
(2 million dollars, Creditor: Park Jin Seok)

00:37:22.414 --> 00:37:23.514
(Mr. Park)

00:37:23.514 --> 00:37:25.124
She just went into the lawyer's office.

00:37:29.554 --> 00:37:31.124
What do you mean the lien can't be removed?

00:37:31.664 --> 00:37:33.164
My husband set it up without my knowledge.

00:37:34.594 --> 00:37:36.094
Regardless of the circumstances,

00:37:36.764 --> 00:37:39.664
The fact that the mortgage is on the property registry means...

00:37:40.234 --> 00:37:42.574
your seal registration certificate, your official seal,

00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:45.744
and the mortgage agreement were all properly filed.

00:37:45.804 --> 00:37:48.274
Exactly! And I'm telling you he did it behind my back.

00:37:49.274 --> 00:37:52.984
No, look. What do I have to do to undo this?

00:37:53.184 --> 00:37:55.254
You'll either have to work it out with your husband directly...

00:37:55.614 --> 00:37:57.554
or file a lawsuit to nullify the mortgage.

00:37:59.254 --> 00:38:01.454
A lawsuit? Do you know how long that will take?

00:38:05.024 --> 00:38:07.024
(Law Firm)

00:38:08.764 --> 00:38:10.734
It says "insufficient funds."

00:38:13.804 --> 00:38:15.104
Insufficient funds?

00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:18.144
That's impossible. Try it again.

00:38:26.084 --> 00:38:28.314
Do you have another card, ma'am?

00:38:30.354 --> 00:38:32.554
So this is why you only left me this one debit card?

00:38:35.394 --> 00:38:36.954
It hasn't even been an hour,

00:38:37.894 --> 00:38:39.564
so just charge me for a 30-minute consultation.

00:38:40.794 --> 00:38:41.794
Okay.

00:39:06.654 --> 00:39:08.794
Why didn't I deposit any cash?

00:39:11.164 --> 00:39:12.994
This is only enough for one night, and then it's all gone.

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:15.264
Darn it.

00:39:15.934 --> 00:39:16.934
Park Jin Seok.

00:39:17.904 --> 00:39:20.164
You're more ruthless than I ever imagined.

00:39:29.814 --> 00:39:30.814
Who is it?

00:39:32.884 --> 00:39:33.884
Honey.

00:39:34.454 --> 00:39:35.684
Seong Jae is here.

00:39:40.524 --> 00:39:41.524
Seong Jae?

00:39:42.494 --> 00:39:44.194
Father, Mother. Have you both been well?

00:39:46.894 --> 00:39:49.094
Seong Jae, what brings you here?

00:39:50.564 --> 00:39:51.664
I was just in the neighborhood.

00:39:52.304 --> 00:39:54.674
And I saw a fruit truck with some great-looking tangerines.

00:39:55.674 --> 00:39:59.074
You shouldn't have. We have tangerines.

00:40:03.014 --> 00:40:04.844
Seong Jae, you're here.

00:40:05.514 --> 00:40:06.684
So you were home, Su Bin.

00:40:10.214 --> 00:40:11.684
Su Bin, go upstairs. Now.

00:40:12.684 --> 00:40:16.054
Dad, why? Can't I stay while he's here?

00:40:16.654 --> 00:40:18.024
I doubt he came to see me.

00:40:18.964 --> 00:40:21.634
She's right. Why would I come here to see Su Bin?

00:40:23.064 --> 00:40:24.464
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:40:25.334 --> 00:40:26.664
I'm just here as myself.

00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:29.604
Just because Su Bin and I made one mistake,

00:40:30.074 --> 00:40:31.874
were you really planning on cutting me out completely?

00:40:33.144 --> 00:40:36.244
Of course not. That's not it.

00:40:36.544 --> 00:40:38.844
Come on in, Seong Jae. Have you had dinner?

00:40:39.244 --> 00:40:41.114
I just made some savory pancakes. Would you like some?

00:40:42.154 --> 00:40:43.984
I'm glad I broke up with Su Bin.

00:40:44.924 --> 00:40:46.654
Especially with what Ji Hyuk is going through,

00:40:47.894 --> 00:40:49.994
it's a relief that I'm not adding to your troubles.

00:40:52.164 --> 00:40:53.864
No, that's okay. I was just passing by.

00:40:55.734 --> 00:40:57.834
You should comb your hair. What a mess.

00:40:59.464 --> 00:41:00.464
What?

00:41:00.904 --> 00:41:01.904
Slob.

00:41:03.704 --> 00:41:05.904
In any case, you're here, so come on in.

00:41:06.274 --> 00:41:09.344
- I can't. I have to go. - Your eldest son is here. What?

00:41:11.944 --> 00:41:12.944
Seong Jae.

00:41:19.884 --> 00:41:21.654
He said he saw some tangerines...

00:41:22.024 --> 00:41:23.724
and brought them because they made him think of us.

00:41:24.324 --> 00:41:26.864
Now that Ji Hyuk is here, come in and eat with us first.

00:41:27.294 --> 00:41:28.464
I have a meeting tonight.

00:41:29.234 --> 00:41:31.334
- I'm heading out. - Okay, see you around.

00:41:31.634 --> 00:41:32.704
I'll be on my way, then.

00:41:39.204 --> 00:41:41.914
Was Seong Jae always that smooth?

00:41:42.944 --> 00:41:44.484
You know how he is. Once he decides, he sees it through.

00:41:45.244 --> 00:41:47.184
How could Seong Jae ever cut ties with you two?

00:42:02.434 --> 00:42:04.004
He shouldn't be doing this.

00:42:04.534 --> 00:42:06.504
Why did he suddenly show up at our house?

00:42:07.804 --> 00:42:11.074
Is he saying we can just be friends again like before?

00:42:12.044 --> 00:42:15.644
Is he that over me that he can just come to our house?

00:42:20.314 --> 00:42:22.154
But then, what was with that look in his eyes?

00:42:23.184 --> 00:42:24.754
Why did he look so sad again?

00:42:25.854 --> 00:42:27.794
Why does he look like he's struggling so much?

00:42:35.034 --> 00:42:37.634
I went ahead and booked that hot spring resort.

00:42:38.064 --> 00:42:39.504
You two just need to pick a date and let me know.

00:42:40.504 --> 00:42:42.174
A hot spring, all of a sudden?

00:42:42.904 --> 00:42:44.444
Before you go back to work,

00:42:44.844 --> 00:42:46.374
I want you two to go enjoy a trip to the hot springs.

00:42:47.514 --> 00:42:48.774
Ji Hyuk.

00:42:49.074 --> 00:42:52.644
My goodness. Then we can go on your day off.

00:42:52.714 --> 00:42:56.454
Once I'm working, I'll be busy, and finding time will be tough.

00:42:57.184 --> 00:42:58.184
Should we?

00:42:59.684 --> 00:43:01.394
So you haven't started dating anyone?

00:43:02.794 --> 00:43:04.564
I've been too busy.

Eun Oh grew up strong and secure, all thanks to her parents' love.

00:43:11.004 --> 00:43:12.534
But still, after her father passed away,

00:43:13.364 --> 00:43:15.474
it seems she had to become the head of the family.

00:43:16.004 --> 00:43:17.574
She must need someone to lean on.

00:43:18.104 --> 00:43:20.004
Show her that she can count on you.

00:43:22.044 --> 00:43:26.014
Dad, you said I wasn't good enough. Why the sudden change of heart?

00:43:26.314 --> 00:43:30.184
No, the Spring... I mean, seeing the way Eun Oh treats me,

00:43:30.784 --> 00:43:32.224
I just realized that everyone in life...

00:43:32.724 --> 00:43:34.954
needs someone to lean on.

00:43:36.994 --> 00:43:37.994
That's true.

Your father seems to really like her.

00:43:47.434 --> 00:43:49.734
Maybe I could just...

00:43:50.434 --> 00:43:51.704
meet her sometime?

00:43:52.144 --> 00:43:53.744
I could also take a look around your office.

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:56.044
No, Mom.

00:43:56.574 --> 00:43:57.584
Please don't.

Why not?

00:44:00.544 --> 00:44:02.384
You never know. My feelings might change.

00:44:03.014 --> 00:44:05.124
I've just been so swamped with work lately.

00:44:05.754 --> 00:44:08.354

You never know what's going to happen.

- You two rest up. I'm going up. - Hey, Ji Hyuk.

00:44:17.864 --> 00:44:21.904
It looks like Eun Oh isn't returning his feelings.

00:44:31.314 --> 00:44:32.314
Really?

00:44:33.384 --> 00:44:35.184
- Does it look good? - Yes.

00:44:35.184 --> 00:44:37.954
- Oh, my. - Since I work in interior design,

00:44:38.454 --> 00:44:40.124
I know the whole capital area like the back of my hand.

00:44:40.384 --> 00:44:41.424
I've been to that neighborhood before.

00:44:41.694 --> 00:44:44.894
- It's a vibrant neighborhood. - Should I sign this lease?

00:44:45.424 --> 00:44:46.424
Go for it.

00:44:47.294 --> 00:44:50.394
But that means we need to hire a manager for this place soon.

00:44:50.734 --> 00:44:52.564
That way, Mom can cut back on her hours, too.

00:44:52.834 --> 00:44:53.834
Right.

00:44:54.104 --> 00:44:56.804

I'm ready to work myself to the bone.

Speaking of work, how about that CEO who'd do anything for you?

00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:06.244
He said he'd visit often.

00:45:06.514 --> 00:45:07.984
Oh, well...

00:45:08.454 --> 00:45:10.214
He's just been really busy at work lately.

00:45:11.154 --> 00:45:14.494
You say that, but you don't sound very convincing.

00:45:15.524 --> 00:45:16.524
I am not!

00:45:17.664 --> 00:45:21.564

00:45:21.664 --> 00:45:22.664

This should be fine as is.

- Yes. - You're home early today.

00:46:10.714 --> 00:46:13.744
I was thinking I'd have dinner at home today...

00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:15.354
and get some work done here.

Then, I'll make you pot rice, so go get some rest.

- Okay. - Pot rice? Do we have no abalone?

00:46:25.594 --> 00:46:26.994
I'll run out and grab some.

00:46:27.324 --> 00:46:31.104
- No abalone, but I did buy oysters. - Oysters.

By the way, Ji Hyuk,

00:48:04.054 --> 00:48:07.624
I was curious about your work, so I peeked at your laptop.

00:48:07.964 --> 00:48:10.934
"Awaiting Heart Transplant." Why were you looking that up?

00:48:12.904 --> 00:48:14.804
Oh, that...

00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:16.734
At work,

00:48:17.334 --> 00:48:19.274
one of my coworkers is in that situation.

00:48:20.044 --> 00:48:21.414
So I got curious and looked it up.

00:48:22.174 --> 00:48:25.714
A heart transplant? That's serious. How old is this coworker?

00:48:27.084 --> 00:48:29.514
Early to mid-30s, I think.

00:48:30.414 --> 00:48:32.084
So they're your age.

00:48:33.424 --> 00:48:34.424
Yes.

00:48:35.354 --> 00:48:36.654
Is it a guy or a girl?

00:48:37.624 --> 00:48:38.624
A guy.

00:48:39.164 --> 00:48:42.664
Oh, no. That's so young. How awful.

00:48:43.734 --> 00:48:44.864
What's so terrible about it?

00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:48.934
Everyone dies eventually. It's the same for everybody.

00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:51.144
I guess you're right.

00:48:51.604 --> 00:48:53.604
One of my friends from high school...

00:48:54.074 --> 00:48:56.944
died at 30, and another at 42.

00:48:58.084 --> 00:49:00.744
But I wonder, is that unfair? Or is it fair?

00:49:01.484 --> 00:49:05.284
We all die, but it feels unfair to die sooner than everyone else.

00:49:06.654 --> 00:49:07.654
What's so unfair about it?

00:49:08.424 --> 00:49:11.764
I just think Koreans get way too worked up about death.

00:49:13.524 --> 00:49:16.464
You're right. Back in the day, if you said that to an elder,

00:49:16.594 --> 00:49:17.634
they'd get really upset.

00:49:18.904 --> 00:49:20.764
So, is your coworker married?

00:49:22.634 --> 00:49:24.034
No.

00:49:25.574 --> 00:49:28.144
That's a small mercy, then.

00:49:30.174 --> 00:49:31.184
I guess so.

00:49:32.314 --> 00:49:35.014
So when is the right time to die, then?

00:49:36.114 --> 00:49:38.024
Honey, what do you think is the best age to go?

00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:39.924
What a question. There's no right age.

00:49:40.284 --> 00:49:41.624
I agree with Ji Hyuk.

00:49:42.054 --> 00:49:43.394
You never know when your number is up.

00:49:44.424 --> 00:49:48.264
That's true. These days, a lot of young people have diabetes,

00:49:48.534 --> 00:49:50.364
and there are quite a few deaths from heart attacks.

00:49:52.734 --> 00:49:54.874
I hope you feel the same way when it's my time to go, Mom.

00:49:56.004 --> 00:50:00.804
You can't see what's coming, but people think they'll reach 100.

00:50:01.004 --> 00:50:03.614
Always chasing one thing or another. Goodness.

00:50:04.844 --> 00:50:05.844
You're right, dear.

00:50:06.184 --> 00:50:08.014
We could be saying goodbye tomorrow for all we know,

00:50:08.784 --> 00:50:10.284
so let's be more loving to each other.

Mom, what about me? Feed me.

00:50:23.794 --> 00:50:25.334
Look at you. This is a first.

00:50:26.004 --> 00:50:28.574
Okay, for my son, too. Open wide!

It's a shame about your coworker, but we learned a big lesson. Right?

00:50:39.014 --> 00:50:40.544
Wow, this is especially good today.

00:50:44.384 --> 00:50:46.754

Mom packed you a lunch since you're working on a Saturday.

00:50:55.234 --> 00:50:58.834
I packed extra, just in case the CEO is there, too.

00:50:59.364 --> 00:51:01.134
- Ji Hyuk? - Yes.

00:51:01.434 --> 00:51:02.734
He might not even be there.

00:51:03.504 --> 00:51:06.574
If he's not there, just eat yours and bring the rest.

00:51:12.844 --> 00:51:15.314
Dad, it's delicious.

00:51:16.454 --> 00:51:18.684
I'll be late tonight. I've got a lot of work to do.

00:51:18.754 --> 00:51:20.354
- I'm off. - Okay, have a good day.

00:51:20.424 --> 00:51:22.694
- Mom, I'm heading out. - Okay, have a good one.

00:51:24.864 --> 00:51:26.594
Ji Hyuk ate a full breakfast before he left.

00:51:27.164 --> 00:51:28.694
He barely ever eats breakfast.

00:51:29.834 --> 00:51:31.864
Maybe work is so stressful...

00:51:32.404 --> 00:51:34.804
that he can't last until lunch on an empty stomach?

00:51:35.474 --> 00:51:37.734
That must be it. He's even working on the weekend.

00:51:38.644 --> 00:51:41.914
So maybe he's been coming home early for a home-cooked dinner?

00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:44.884
I should put more effort into dinner, starting tonight.

00:51:45.444 --> 00:51:46.844
He said he'd be late tonight, though.

00:51:47.744 --> 00:51:48.754
That's right.

00:51:49.514 --> 00:51:51.954
- I'm getting ready for work, honey. - Okay.

No, I just got to the office.

All right. I'll swing by the office later.

Hey. What time are you having lunch?

00:53:38.694 --> 00:53:42.234
My mom packed enough tofu pockets for two.

Sorry.

00:54:17.864 --> 00:54:20.904
You and I have eaten tofu pockets together more than ten times.

00:54:23.874 --> 00:54:25.404
Tastes change.

00:54:27.244 --> 00:54:28.244
No.

00:54:28.844 --> 00:54:30.074
That's just an excuse.

00:54:31.274 --> 00:54:33.014
The way you've been treating me has changed,

00:54:34.184 --> 00:54:35.784
and I feel like there's a reason.

00:54:38.524 --> 00:54:39.624
Just tell me straight.

00:54:40.454 --> 00:54:43.194
Don't beat around the bush like you always do.

00:54:45.864 --> 00:54:46.864
Why...

00:54:48.164 --> 00:54:50.094
are you treating me differently?

00:54:53.704 --> 00:54:54.974
The reason is,

00:55:01.414 --> 00:55:04.474
I feel I've gotten too close to people on a personal level,

00:55:04.844 --> 00:55:06.744
like Su Jeong and you, Eun Oh.

00:55:08.084 --> 00:55:11.154
I feel like I've let my guard down too much while at the think tank.

00:55:12.084 --> 00:55:13.784
So I'm trying to maintain a professional distance.

00:55:16.154 --> 00:55:18.194
And I'm supposed to believe that?

00:55:20.994 --> 00:55:22.464
What's so hard to believe?

00:55:23.764 --> 00:55:26.934
What will you do if you wear him out and he just gives up?

00:55:27.334 --> 00:55:28.334
Would you be okay with that?

00:55:29.004 --> 00:55:30.234
You have to give him a sign.

00:55:31.204 --> 00:55:32.204
Let him know.

00:55:32.774 --> 00:55:34.814
"It's okay to tell me how you feel now."

00:55:35.844 --> 00:55:37.874
Make it obvious enough for him to get the hint. Got it?

00:55:51.124 --> 00:55:52.124
What if I told you...

00:55:53.924 --> 00:55:55.494
that I like you?

00:55:59.464 --> 00:56:00.464
I...

00:56:01.874 --> 00:56:03.704
The misunderstandings I had about you,

00:56:05.544 --> 00:56:06.644
they're all cleared up now.

00:56:08.914 --> 00:56:12.184
Your decision to marry the daughter of Haneul Construction without love.

00:56:13.314 --> 00:56:15.454
I know it wasn't just because of your principles.

00:56:16.484 --> 00:56:17.854
I understand all of that now.

00:56:20.054 --> 00:56:21.084
So the misunderstanding...

00:56:23.794 --> 00:56:25.124
is cleared up?

00:56:27.864 --> 00:56:28.864
And so,

00:56:30.194 --> 00:56:32.364
I've forgiven you for everything.

00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:43.344
I see.

00:56:47.244 --> 00:56:49.354
And what if I mean it...

00:56:50.554 --> 00:56:52.254
when I say I like you again?

00:56:55.254 --> 00:56:56.254
Even so,

00:56:56.824 --> 00:56:58.324
is this still how you want to treat me?

00:57:01.694 --> 00:57:02.934
What's the point, Eun Oh?

00:57:19.414 --> 00:57:20.844
Timing really is...

00:57:25.454 --> 00:57:26.654
everything, isn't it?

00:57:32.294 --> 00:57:33.494
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

00:57:34.524 --> 00:57:35.594
It seems we...

00:57:36.234 --> 00:57:37.334
just missed each other.

00:57:39.504 --> 00:57:40.764
I've already moved on.

00:57:42.774 --> 00:57:44.944
Moved on?

00:57:46.104 --> 00:57:47.274
What does that even mean?

00:57:48.414 --> 00:57:49.974
The human heart is a funny thing.

00:57:51.444 --> 00:57:53.344
While I was on my business trip,

00:57:54.984 --> 00:57:57.854
I did some thinking about my position as CEO.

00:57:59.154 --> 00:58:01.054
The CEO and a team leader...

00:58:02.024 --> 00:58:04.354
Don't you think it's ridiculous for us to be dating at work?

00:58:08.064 --> 00:58:09.594
Just because you had that thought,

00:58:10.734 --> 00:58:12.434
your feelings just...

00:58:13.664 --> 00:58:14.804
They can change, just like that?

00:58:16.404 --> 00:58:18.004
That's why I said it's a funny thing.

00:58:20.474 --> 00:58:21.674
I think I've just been...

00:58:23.074 --> 00:58:24.674
worn out by it all.

00:58:27.644 --> 00:58:30.454
And I think you were right. We're beyond repair.

00:58:35.124 --> 00:58:37.194
I'm sorry, Eun Oh.

00:58:39.494 --> 00:58:40.724
From now on,

00:58:43.364 --> 00:58:44.734
I'm going to keep things strictly professional.

00:58:49.504 --> 00:58:50.774
What you just said...

00:58:52.844 --> 00:58:54.244
Do you really mean it?

00:58:55.774 --> 00:58:56.974
Yes, I mean it.

00:58:58.844 --> 00:59:00.684
So you should stop thinking about me...

00:59:00.944 --> 00:59:02.984
and just focus on the Thirty Houses Project.

00:59:03.784 --> 00:59:06.024
About the official name for the project...

00:59:06.924 --> 00:59:09.224
I've decided to call it "Living Life Thirty."

00:59:13.494 --> 00:59:16.464
(CEO's Office)

00:59:54.104 --> 00:59:56.304
For a mortgage suit of this scale,

00:59:56.304 --> 00:59:58.274
we require a 100,000-dollar retainer.

01:00:01.304 --> 01:00:02.414
A hundred thousand dollars?

01:00:03.374 --> 01:00:04.674
I can come up with it.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:10.984
(Ms. Shin)

01:00:11.924 --> 01:00:12.924
What is it?

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:17.224
- Operating expenses? - Yes.

01:00:17.224 --> 01:00:19.124
This week's operating cost payment hasn't come through.

01:00:19.994 --> 01:00:21.124
Just wait a few days.

01:00:21.794 --> 01:00:25.164
Ma'am. We don't work on credit.

01:00:25.904 --> 01:00:27.204
You're already two days late.

01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:28.804
I said I'll pay you!

01:00:29.034 --> 01:00:31.604
We have 100 men deployed to catch Han Woo Jin.

01:00:33.204 --> 01:00:35.574
Send the money within an hour, or I'm pulling everyone out.

01:00:36.614 --> 01:00:37.814
Hey, Ms. Shin...

01:00:39.714 --> 01:00:40.814
Darn it.

01:00:41.914 --> 01:00:44.084
Do you have any idea how much money I've paid you?

01:00:46.884 --> 01:00:47.884
No way.

01:00:48.724 --> 01:00:49.824
I have to catch Woo Jin.

01:00:50.554 --> 01:00:52.894
(Ms. Shin)

01:00:54.794 --> 01:00:56.234
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

01:01:07.274 --> 01:01:09.144
(Gaon Foundation)

01:01:10.944 --> 01:01:11.944
What's going on?

01:01:14.284 --> 01:01:15.384
Secretary Ko.

01:01:15.784 --> 01:01:16.884
Secretary Ko!

01:01:16.954 --> 01:01:18.884
(Gaon Foundation)

01:01:24.194 --> 01:01:25.924
HQ called this morning and said...

01:01:25.924 --> 01:01:27.664
they emptied out the office yesterday.

01:01:27.964 --> 01:01:29.594
And they told me I'm on paid leave for now.

01:01:31.964 --> 01:01:33.464
He went after the foundation, too?

01:01:41.274 --> 01:01:43.474
You're pushing me to the brink, Park Jin Seok.

01:01:47.214 --> 01:01:48.654
He doesn't want me to beg.

01:01:52.024 --> 01:01:54.454
Ms. Ko Seong Hui, please be advised that as of today,

01:01:54.524 --> 01:01:56.394
you are relieved of your duties as Gaon Foundation's director.

01:02:00.924 --> 01:02:03.994
(Gaon Foundation)

01:02:09.374 --> 01:02:11.034
(Shoealls)

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:12.644
(CEO Park Jin Seok)

01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:14.604
Sir, your wife is here.

01:02:16.814 --> 01:02:17.944
So she came here.

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:20.984
Send her in.

01:02:29.724 --> 01:02:31.924
I see you came to the office instead of home.

01:02:33.194 --> 01:02:34.694
I told them I didn't want any tea.

01:02:36.194 --> 01:02:37.794
So you're just trying to make this quick?

01:02:38.864 --> 01:02:41.134
You don't want a long speech, do you?

01:02:42.034 --> 01:02:43.034
I don't know about that.

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:48.504
You knew I'd come today, didn't you?

01:02:50.174 --> 01:02:51.174
Yes, today.

01:02:52.314 --> 01:02:55.254
I left you 2,000 dollars in that account.

01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:59.424
That'll last you what, three days at a hotel?

01:03:01.454 --> 01:03:02.524
Honey.

01:03:03.094 --> 01:03:05.824
You should've only taken the things you bought for me.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:09.394
How could you steal my own assets? That's so cheap.

01:03:10.434 --> 01:03:13.204
That is no way for Shoe Joy's chairman to behave.

01:03:16.404 --> 01:03:18.974
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:03:20.744 --> 01:03:21.744
Right.

01:03:22.614 --> 01:03:24.674
So, what brings you all the way to the office?

01:03:27.284 --> 01:03:29.584
I came because you've decided to end this once and for all.

01:03:30.284 --> 01:03:31.454
I want a divorce.

01:03:32.054 --> 01:03:33.054
A divorce?

01:03:35.594 --> 01:03:36.854
Why would I give you a divorce?

01:03:41.494 --> 01:03:42.594
You're refusing...

01:03:43.564 --> 01:03:44.664
to divorce me?

01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:57.444
The company's growth is strong right now.

01:03:57.874 --> 01:04:00.884
Once the Image Modeling Project...

01:04:00.944 --> 01:04:02.184
and the Made to Your Taste Project start,

01:04:02.184 --> 01:04:03.454
it'll be a game-changer.

01:04:04.154 --> 01:04:05.984
I'm really enjoying this process, Seong Jae.

01:04:06.354 --> 01:04:08.554
Is that why you're here, working on a Saturday?

01:04:11.754 --> 01:04:13.064
When you're dying?

01:04:15.794 --> 01:04:18.834
Look, if you don't get a heart transplant,

01:04:19.434 --> 01:04:20.964
they said you'll die within a few months.

01:04:21.934 --> 01:04:23.804
How can you care about work at a time like this?

01:04:24.804 --> 01:04:26.004
Hey, Ji Hyuk.

01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.044
This isn't right.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.044
Your parents need to know about this.

01:04:30.044 --> 01:04:31.944
You're the one who's not getting it.

01:04:32.814 --> 01:04:33.814
Seong Jae.

01:04:34.114 --> 01:04:36.214
It's best if my parents don't know for as long as possible.

01:04:36.684 --> 01:04:37.714
If they find out ten days before,

01:04:37.714 --> 01:04:38.884
they will suffer through ten miserable days.

01:04:38.884 --> 01:04:41.154
If they find out a month before, it's a month of misery for them.

01:04:42.394 --> 01:04:43.894
It's better if it's sudden.

01:04:44.554 --> 01:04:45.724
If possible...

01:04:46.794 --> 01:04:48.594
Like the day before I die?

01:04:51.394 --> 01:04:52.964
I just don't get it.

01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:57.974
If they have to watch their own child die,

01:04:59.804 --> 01:05:01.644
it's best their pain is as brief as possible.

01:05:08.384 --> 01:05:09.384
Dad.

01:05:19.594 --> 01:05:20.594
Father.

01:06:07.344 --> 01:06:09.814
(Our Golden Days)

01:06:10.044 --> 01:06:12.284
"Get my affairs in order?" How could I?

01:06:12.544 --> 01:06:15.244
Ji Hyuk is lying.

01:06:15.344 --> 01:06:18.284
Does that make any sense, you fool? Our eldest son is sick.

01:06:18.384 --> 01:06:20.824
Isn't an artificial heart an option?

01:06:21.024 --> 01:06:24.794
The only reason Seong Jae would cry is to ask for their blessing again,

01:06:24.894 --> 01:06:26.394
or if something's wrong with Dad.

01:06:26.464 --> 01:06:27.994
Could my dad be sick?

01:06:27.994 --> 01:06:29.894
How could you, after all I did to raise you?

01:06:29.964 --> 01:06:32.864
You get me 200,000 dollars. You're my daughter. Got it?

01:06:32.964 --> 01:06:37.134
That's your punishment for deceiving me for 26 years.

01:06:37.204 --> 01:06:40.044
Why should I? Why? You think I'll take this lying down?
