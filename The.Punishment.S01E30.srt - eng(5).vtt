Listen, take it easy
with those old bones of yours.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.590
Nonsense. I'm perfectly fine.

beaten up by that guy.

I took a hit for you, you know?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.580
No, I took a hit for you.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.640
If you don't believe me,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.840
we can check the surveillance
when we get back.

You're so stubborn. Listen...

No.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.910
We must make it clear.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.800
Check the surveillance

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.330

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.930
Be honest with me.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.810
How's the investigation going

with Liu Yi's case?

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.860
Why did I hear

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.110
that Liu Yi

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.400
isn't missing?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.000
So far,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.590
there are still some suspicious points.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.080
We have to consider
the potential for a criminal case.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.870
So,

has Liu Yi

It's just an assumption for now.

What exactly is going on?

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.160
According to the news
from the accident site,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.630
the collapse was due to

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.560

on the situation for now,

If you can't find this person,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.880
I'm afraid you won't get through this.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.610
I've already taken care of Liu Yi.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.269
He knows too much.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.310
We can't keep him.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.780
Wait,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.510
what do you mean by we can't keep him?

We haven't solved this matter yet.

You can't cause more trouble.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.740
Otherwise, I can't help you.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.659
I had no choice.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.870
If he sells us out,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.380

But if the responsible person dies,
what am I supposed to do?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.790
What kind of mess is this?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.500
He has

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.480
a vice general manager named Fang Lei,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.720
who's solely in charge of engineering

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.630
and has no direct connection with us.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.600
He's the perfect scapegoat.

Got it.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.360
I'm on it.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.390
I'll make sure no one makes a scene.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.050
No trouble,

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.170

he can't get involved in this,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.170
so he wants me to be fully in charge.

All the injured are in my hospital now.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.680
Director Peng,
please hold off on that report

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.770
and buy me some time

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.520
so I can talk to their families.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.610
I'll try my best.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.680
But listen,

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.430
I have my limits.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.310
As for Fang Lei,
I'll have someone look for him.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.000
Once we find him,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.200
we'll send him to you.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.870
Don't worry, Director Peng.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.070
Whatever trouble Zhang Xin caused,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.920
I will fix it.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.600
You might fix it for now,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.560
but can you save the day every time?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.750
She acts recklessly,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.620
and I'm the one in trouble.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.150
Why would our boss use

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.800
someone like her?

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.140
We're not the boss,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.830
so we can't possibly know why.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.480
Perhaps Zhang Xin

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.490
has other exceptional abilities.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.040
Isn't your child taking
the college entrance exam soon?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.170
Have you decided on which university?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.050
I've been too busy

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.460
to think about it.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.170
Don't put too much pressure on him.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.920
If domestic universities don't work out,
you can send him abroad.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.140
I opened an account overseas

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.600

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.240
This is one trap after another.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.630
However,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.530
you really know

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.020
how to utilize
others people's weaknesses.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.570
Listen,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.409

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.490
Zhang Xin.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.520
She'll cause big trouble sooner or later.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.870
Got it.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.630
I've been keeping an eye on
Liu Yi for a while.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.480
Those forced demolition cases
in the port development zone

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.870
are all related to him.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.680
They are all contracted by him

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.800
and built

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.830
by Xinrui Group.

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.830
Do you think no one's backing him up?

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.560
No way.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.450
Xinrui Group was also mentioned
in this meeting.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.570
But our leaders had differing opinions.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.820
Do you suspect

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.090
that Xinrui Group silenced him?

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.850
Well,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.000
on the night Liu Yi died,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.560
someone called Fang Lei

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.670
went to see him.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600
I've sent someone to find this person.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.930
He might have witnessed the entire crime.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.460
After all these years,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.070
we've never obtained

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.470
any evidence of Xinrui Group's crimes.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.160
Now we finally have a chance.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.050
If we get the evidence,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.630
we mustn't let them get away.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.570
Rest assured.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.100

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.360
Good then.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.650
I was just teasing you.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.670
Sir.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.670
Sir.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.030
How's it going?

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.600
Sir,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.550
don't worry.
We're keeping a close eye on it.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.810
Nothing will go wrong.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.900
It's just that they work

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.510
for over ten hours straight each day,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.450
and they can't keep this up.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.840
Look,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.000
get some money from my car,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.120
distribute it to the guys,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.080
and spread them out
across several locations.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.730
Thank you, sir!

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.630
Thank you, sir!

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.390
Go ahead.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.050
Uncle Tianye.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.920
Bring Tianfei over here.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.750
Got it.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.160
Thank you, everyone.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.400
Thank you for coming.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.030
Sir!

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.230
Where's Uncle Tianfei?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.760
He got drunk and passed out.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.840
Sir,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.480
a few days ago, that Feng from Longwan

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.630
arrested several of my guys again.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.630
Who did he arrest?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.590
Some young boys who've been following me
for a few days.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.440
Is it serious?

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.380
It's an assault case,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.280
and I've already arranged someone
to negotiate with the victims' families.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.200
But don't worry.
They'll keep their mouth shut.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.050
Listen,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.390
take care of their families

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.440
so that they can rest assured.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.250
No problem.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:45.870
Tianye.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.000
How confident are you?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.200
One hundred percent.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.750
Really?

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.870
Absolutely.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.870
If we can't resolve this,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.470
our boss will be angry,
and we'll be in trouble.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.150
Tianye, don't scare me like that.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.380
Didn't I tell you

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.870
that their building materials
were problematic?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.750
You said it was fine

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.960
and told us not to worry.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.120
Now something bad has happened.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.380
Something really bad.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.610
The point is...

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.200
The point is that the higher-ups
are coming to investigate me!

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.720
I'm not trying to scare you.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.580
Everything depends on this move.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.980
Xiaoshuai,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.440
take some men to the construction site.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.780
Taoyi.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.360
Contact Dr. Chen

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.440
and the funeral parlor.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.000
Okay.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.440
Peng,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.630
take Tianfei to talk to
the victims' families.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.080
Let them sign the papers quickly

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.390
so we can cremate the bodies.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.790
Why are you making this so complicated?

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.790
You should just leave

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.990
this kind of thing to Gao
and the others.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:37.080
Tianye.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.440
As we discussed before,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.200
Zhang Xin has been with the boss
for so many years,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.480
so it won't be easy
to drive a wedge between them,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.270
right?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.870
Isn't this our opportunity?

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.670
Wait a minute.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.380
I have a question.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.150
About these construction problems,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.950
did you know about them already?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.240
Then why didn't you fix it earlier?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.320
If you had, this wouldn't have happened,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.480
and no one would have died!

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.750
Wait, it was Xinrui's problems.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.030
Why should Tianyun get involved?

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.320
I'm dealing with it now

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.960
because I want to impress the boss.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.870
Three people died!

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.220
Well,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.350
if we had been in charge of this project,

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.270
this wouldn't have happened, right?

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.270
So, why didn't the boss give it to us?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.360
Because in the boss's heart,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.960
Zhang Xin is more important.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.200
Now that Zhang Xin is in trouble,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.160
it's our chance to climb up.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.940
Tianye, we already have
everything we need.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.660
Why do you still want more?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.770
What do you want?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.750
What are you after?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.810
I don't understand what the point is!

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.480
Peng,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.150
let me tell you what I'm trying to do.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.320
We need to grow bigger,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.120
to become the biggest.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.720
Otherwise, others will...

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.870
Aren't we big enough?

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.000
Listen, in the future,
there may not be another group like us

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.790
-in Longwan or Zhao Village...
-Us? Is it still us?

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.270
I'm the last to know all this.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.270
Is it still us?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.240
Wait, you...

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.600
That's why you're angry, right?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.840
It's not about this!

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.030
It's about human lives!

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.440
People died!

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.900
Human lives!

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.840
Haven't you seen anyone die before?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.110
Have you never had blood on your hands?

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.960
I've brought everyone into this game,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.220
so let's keep gambling

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:12.710
and win it all,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.020
okay?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.700
Don't be angry.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.750
Alright.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.170
Go back and make arrangements.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.480
I want to see results tomorrow.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.960
Alright,

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.290
It's just a matter of driving a wedge
between them, isn't it?

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.410
It's not a big deal, right?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.920
Peng.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.960
Peng, it's okay.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200
Just relax, Peng.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:40.960
Relax.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.960
It's no big deal.

Wait a moment.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.320
Come with me to a place later.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.150
Okay.

This is Hanzhou.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.670
And that?

Honestly, heart disease

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.590
is manageable

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.730
with proper rest

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:35.290
and timely treatment.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.080
You didn't call me over

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.850
just to tell me
I have heart disease, right?

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.070
Ye,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.710
everyone has seen

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.030
your abilities and contributions.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.540
To be honest,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.600
we do hope you could work
for a few more years.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.970
But using younger cadres

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.030
is the irreversible major trend.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.000
It's not up to our wishes.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.400
I understand
why we're using younger cadres

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.490
and giving them opportunities.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.890
But I still have cases to solve.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.590
Bringing this up now

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.460
might seem sudden.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.320
And I understand

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.650
why you can't accept it immediately.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.680
Party Secretary Li, how about this?

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.810
I have a suggestion.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.750
There should be a transition period.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:21.750
What do you think?

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.960
Okay.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.110
Please consider
how to hand over your work properly

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.640
as soon as you can.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.820
Meanwhile,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.170
we'll also discuss

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.550
if there's a new position
suitable for your health condition.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.550
What do you think?

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.680
Ye,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.850
there's always more work to do.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.070
You've been working hard your whole life.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.070
It's time to rest.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.830
Okay.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.600
Sir, now that both of you have considered
everything so thoroughly on my behalf,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.350
and I'm about the age to retire anyway,

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.930
I'll submit my retirement application.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.240
We can always count on

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.000
our seasoned cadres

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
at crucial times.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.760
By the way,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.350
Ye,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.130
who do you think would be suitable

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.310
to take your position after you leave?

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.200
Yan Ming, I suppose.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.790
He's the executive deputy director

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.320
and is familiar
with the bureau's situation.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
But Yan Ming's age

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.230
is a bit awkward.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.320
He's not much younger than you, right?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.130
What about Peng Hanzhang?

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.510
Peng Hanzhang

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.910
doesn't have as much leadership experience
as Yan Ming does.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.810
Party Secretary Li.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.550
I think we should recommend Yan Ming
to the provincial bureau.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.200
Moving from executive deputy director
to director

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.590
is the natural progression,

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.000
and it won't cause

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.790
much disruption to our overall work.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:40.790
What do you think?

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.320
Let's settle on this for now.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.960
We'll discuss it further
at the meeting later.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.550
Okay?

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.630
I won't sign it.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.090
My brother died because of you.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.050
[Feng Jiang,
Brother of the deceased worker, Feng Hai]

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.850
It wasn't a sudden heart attack.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:23.720
This guy

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.060
is so stubborn.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.070
Who is he?

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.240
Feng Jiang.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.560
His brother Feng Hai died.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.740
Feng Jiang.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.750
Your brother

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.030
died from a sudden heart attack.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:36.110
That's the fact.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:37.880
You have to accept it

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.110
whether you like it

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.270
or not.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.550
No way.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.690
Well,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.210
is the money not enough?

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.850
Can money bring my brother back?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.200
Can it?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.270
What are you doing?

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.600
What are you going to do?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.950
You won't sign with this hand anyway.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.950
Let's chop it off.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.980
You've gone too far!

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.440
Enough!

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.330
Peng.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.640
We

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.180
don't want to make things
difficult for you.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.760
After all, your brother is gone,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.020
and you must carry on with your lives,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.750
right?

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.870
And all of you.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.920
If you're willing to sign it,

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200
I'll make the call

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.650
to pay you extra.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.750
If you don't...

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.450
I suggest you think carefully.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.370
You can't leave unless you sign it.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.510
Don't make too much noise.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.590
Their families have signed the papers.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.550
Tianye wants you

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.110
to take care of the bodies tonight.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.920
Any problems?

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.040
[Family Signature: Feng Jiang]

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.150
Now that Tianye has given the order,

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:50.480
[Chen Liang, Director of Tianyun Hospital]

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.280
I will get it done no matter what.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.400
I'll take the bodies

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.240
to the crematorium right away.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.830
Let Tianye know when it's done.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.730
Okay.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.510
How's it going?

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.160
Everything that needed to be said and done
is taken care of.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.920
Are you sure?

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.550
Make some arrangements in the city.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.160
We'll go to the hospital
to visit the injured and put on a show.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.880
Once the accident report is released,

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.280
we'll be able to
keep things under control.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.070
Hope so.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.300
You all need
to keep your heads clear these days.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.680
The police are still
investigating Liu Yi's case.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.410
By police, I mean your brother.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.000
As for the police,

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:30.810
just leave it to me.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:32.430
Please tell the boss

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.000
not to worry.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.200
I'm your boss too.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.900
Shouldn't you reassure me first?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.510
Yes.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.760
That's right.

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.750
Well,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.560
when you have time,
come to Hanzhou Club to relax.

I'm expecting more fun.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.730
No problem.

Tianye.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.350
As he climbs higher in position,
he becomes more annoying.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.000
Soon,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.640
we won't be able to associate with him.

Uncle Limin,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.960
annoying people are easier to control.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.980
Easier to control?

on his way here,

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.770
but then something urgent
came up at his shop,

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.530
so he probably can't make it.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.300
Never mind.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.880
Don't force him.

That case is still not solved,

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.030

how he feels.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.880
I wanted to retire with no regrets.

Yet so many cases remain unsolved.

You must keep digging.

But don't act recklessly.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.340

There's not even a car!
What could you be busy with?

I've been busy cultivating my character

Wait, why did you come here?

You didn't show up or even say anything.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.070
I had to check on you.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.290
I had to make sure you were still alive.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.810
and shouldn't say.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.910
Rest assured.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.260
I won't say anything.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.380
Don't cause us any trouble.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.270
Sure.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.490
Not just you, tell your worker brothers

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.640
to keep their mouth shut.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.310
Don't worry.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.920
I've talked to all of them.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.140
Nothing will go wrong.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:23.480
After I get out of the hospital,

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.480
let's have a meal with Director Qin.

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.270
Thanks to his help,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.660
we can get free treatment here.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.280
Just focus on your recovery.

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.440
Okay.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.920
Where's Fang Lei?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.200
I really don't know.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:44.920
I think he's been hiding
since the incident.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.960
I'm asking you
precisely because I know he ran away.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.670
He's an important person now,

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.070
and the higher-ups are paying attention.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.160
If you know anything,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.890
just tell me.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.920
Got it.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240
Something just occurred to me,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.440
but I don't know

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.640
if it's useful.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.840
He and our company's accountant girl...

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.440
Well, their relationship is

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.110
kind of...

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.540
You know, that kind of relationship.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.239
Why don't you ask her?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.530
Perhaps she knows where he is.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:17.510
Are they still together?

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.100
I wouldn't know.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.199
Alright then.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.070
Take care of yourself.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.630
Rest well.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.889
Okay.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.030
Then I'm leaving.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.630
Goodbye.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.030
Bye, officer.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400
What should we do?

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.420
Let's look for him.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.150
Okay.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.659
I'll investigate that accountant girl.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.400
Tianye.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.660
Did you notice how

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.740
Bo and the others looked at us?

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.140
It's like we're enemies.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.430
You're overthinking it.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.420
It's just that I suddenly feel

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.760
so distant from them.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.300
Maybe in their hearts,

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.340
we're not family anymore.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.880
I wonder what Jiangyong

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.400
would do

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.640
if he were there.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.170
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.550
As the movie line goes,

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.340
"What would happen
if we could go back in time?"

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.570
Take a guess.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.110
What would happen?

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.240
It would be the same.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.150
You've been single

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:45.970
for so long with no one to talk to

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.760
that you always think too much.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880
I'm fine being alone.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.240
What's good about that?

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.550
I'll ask Ziyi to set you up with someone.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.840
Please don't, Tianye.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.000
I'm used to this.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.280
Used to what?

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.190
Just give it a try,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.450
and you might discover
a whole new world.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.940
It would still be the same.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.160
Now you're throwing my words
right back at me, huh?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.820
This is the place our boss mentioned.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:58.800
Upstairs?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.060
Let's check it out.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.690
Fang Lei, right?

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.490
You're good at hiding.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.510
Do us a favor.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.060
Are you sure Fang Lei is here?

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.760
I investigated that female accountant
the foreman mentioned.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.070
Recently, she rented a place
but hasn't been living there.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.930
Fang Lei is very likely to be here.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.080
Call an ambulance.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.080
Notify the team

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.140
to check the scene.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.150
Is this 120?

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.870
We're at 256 Xiaxing Village,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.880
and someone needs
emergency medical attention right now.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.080
Please come quickly.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:43.320
Liu,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.000
Zeng Xu and I are at

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.290
256 Xiaxing Village.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.890
Come over right now.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.480
Wake up.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.890
We've arrived.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.230
Hurry up.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.610
Stand up straight.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:37.780
Choose one.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.230
Sir,

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.590
I'm sorry!

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.790
Please spare me!

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:51.250
I need to ask you something.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.590
What did Liu Yi tell you
before the incident?

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.790
How much do you know about Xinrui Group?

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.330
He asked me

00:39:58.590 --> 00:39:59.840
to fetch a flash drive

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.400
from his drawer in the company

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.460
and bring it to him.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.440
Then...

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.690
I saw someone leave his house

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.250
and drive away.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.880
Where is the flash drive?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.590
I have it.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.610
Did you see who drove to Liu Yi's place?

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.150
I don't know.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.670
But I took photos with my phone

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.790
of that car.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.170
Your phone.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.400
Here, take it.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.320
Keep the phone.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.570
If anyone asks, show them the photos.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.710
If the police ask who was driving,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.090
just tell them it was Zheng Gao,

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.210
understand?

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.100
Uncle Tianfei.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:13.320
Didn't Uncle Tianye say

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.030
we should use Fang Lei

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.230
to redirect the police's attention
to Zhang Xin?

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.490
Why mention Zheng Gao?

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.840
If the police see the photos,

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.550
tracking down Zhang Xin and Guazi

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.880
is just a matter of time.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.520
I just want to set a trap, so they'll take

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.510
a longer route.

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:27.890
If Qin Feng falls for it,

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.510
we'll kill two birds with one stone.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.790
Uncle Tianfei, but Uncle Tianye said...

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:32.430
Enough.

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.220
Listen to me this time.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.650
Don't tell Tianye.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.920
Tomorrow, go to the police station
and turn yourself in.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.480
Take the blame for this.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.860
The police are looking for you anyway.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:50.960
Just tell them that nobody died

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.210
in the accident,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.440
and that you bought
those building materials

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.840
because they were cheap,

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.480
understand?

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.080
How can I take the blame
for something this big?

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.480
People died at the construction site,

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.020
and it's not my fault!

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.110
The building materials
designated by the group

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.880
were problematic!

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.650
Do you even know
what taking the blame means?

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.950
Why else would we try to find you?

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.960
If you take the blame for this,

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:28.230
this will be over.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:31.280
Otherwise, think about it.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.680
Think about your future.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.350
Think about

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:35.320
your family.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.410
I can...

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.710
I can do it!

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:39.480
I was

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.910
blinded by greed.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.050
I'll do whatever you tell me to do,

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.360
but you must promise

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.940
to spare my family!

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.100
I will certainly

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.360
keep my word.

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.860
But will you

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.000
keep yours?

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:56.920
Look,

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.580
in a moment,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.830
we'll make an oath in front of

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:01.840
Lord Guan Yu.

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:04.010
Lord Guan Yu?
