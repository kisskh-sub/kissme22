00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:52.498
=Light of Dawn=

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.799
This one is good.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.040
Use it for the front page.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.079
You handle the rest you see fit.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.560
Mr. Xu.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.360
Wu. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.719
Why are you suddenly pushing me
to the front

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.080
and putting me on the papers?
Front page headlines, no less.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.360
What were you thinking?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.159
I...

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.199
Wu,

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.800
our group's business

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.199
has grown bigger.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.400
Honestly,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.840
I can't keep up anymore.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.960
And my health, you know how it is.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.719
My family matters too.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.039
I'm exhausted, really.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.919
So I figured it's time for you
to step into the spotlight.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.960
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.159
Just do what I say.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.800
Listen to me.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.840
Only then will
your wife and son survive.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.120
Are you asking for death?
You dare do this here?

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.519
Hong.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.399
You've never tried it before, right?

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.240
Try it.

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:34.680
Wang Mengmei, go back and rest.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.990
If you don't stop this,
you won't make it to next year.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.680
You think you will?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.879
All of you will?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.040
The club is going to transform.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.959
What does that mean?

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.399
The machine's worn out.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:54.959
They're swapping in new parts.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.319
But before that,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.639
shouldn't we at least eat our fill?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.000
Who knows where they'll dump us?

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.639
We're vermin.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.360
We're vermin.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.839
Righteous pesticides.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:20.199
Righteous pesticides.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.360
Make sure

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:28.639
it kills us all!

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.600
Kill us all.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.360
Let's dance. Come on.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.120
Feifei, come on. Stop playing.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000
Eat. Come on.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.079
Stop playing.

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.160
Stop playing.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.560
Don't just play. Eat properly.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.120
What are you snapping at her?

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:56.360
She won't eat.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.480
Good girl. Let's eat.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.199
Feifei, let's play.

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:03.319
Let's go.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.160
So cute.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.639
Do you want to see little fish
over there?

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.959
Look.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.959
So many fish. See?

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.639
Black, right?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.240
Listen up.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.319
Starting tomorrow,

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.040
we're cutting the stage shows in half.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.000
Why?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.680
The club business is being separated
from the group.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.360
You're shutting the club down?

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.759
You know what has happened to the club.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.439
Better close it down sooner.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.319
The girls are under my care.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.120
We'll need severance pay

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.519
to part on good terms.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.959
The party at the club never ends.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:00.759
What do you mean?

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160
Mr. Xu said

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.959
the girls

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:05.160
have already made enough money

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.480
to live comfortably for life.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.519
But

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:11.040
it's better they stay
where we can keep an eye on them.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.160
So none of us is leaving?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.240
No. I agree with Mr. Xu.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.160
I never really thought about it before.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.959
But since Feifei was born,

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.759
I feel I need to leave
something clean behind for her.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.800
What are you implying?

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:28.959
Who are you calling unclean?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.600
Who do you think?

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.680
I'm asking you.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.199
Calm down.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.680
Alright. Sit down.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.560
So,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.639
what exactly do you want?

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.600
We've all stepped into
the same muddy water.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.290
You think you can keep your distance,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.240
walk away clean,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800
return home, and marry some honest man?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.199
That's not going to happen.

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.240
We'll arrange a place for the girls

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.839
with good food and good care

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.199
until they grow old.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.160
Who knows,

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.360
maybe we'll

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.759
end up there too.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.920
Go! Go!

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.399
Soon you won't see him anymore.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.639
Are you not upset?

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.990
I'm content
with what I have right now.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.840
You can tell a child's future
by the age of three.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.240
That's enough.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.799
What's your plan?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.759
I hid a few of the tapes

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.520
Yang Wenyuan collected.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.919
You're here.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.519
I'll turn them in

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.759
to the provincial prosecutor.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.399
I've written the report as well.

00:09:43.159 --> 00:09:44.000
For three years,

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.759
every single day,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.300
I've thought about finishing
what Yang Wenyuan couldn't.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.440
To shut the club down

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.080
and give the girls their lives back.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:02.000
This is our last chance.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:03.759
If we don't do it now,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.159
once the club is shut down,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.080
we won't even know where we'll end up.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.720
What if...

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:13.039
What if we hit a wall?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.840
Then there's no turning back.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.399
You only live once.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.080
You have to take the leap.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.520
There should've been more people
like Yang Wenyuan in this world.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:27.679
Ms. Qu!

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:35.480
Their generation

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:39.000
will be different.

00:10:59.679 --> 00:11:00.559
Cancel the lease.

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:03.559
I only rented this place
so I could see the child more easily.

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.720
No one's sharing the burden now.

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:07.639
There's no reason to stay.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.720
We don't have much left.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.320
Buy a cheaper place,

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.679
farther away.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.880
And don't tell relatives or friends
that you once lived somewhere this nice.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.399
People can't stand
seeing others do well.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.080
You know that.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:30.990
Not coming anymore?

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.480
No.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.519
Never again.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.360
But promise me one thing.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.639
Never tell the boy

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:47.039
who his real mother is.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.039
All these years,

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:04.480
the guests have always avoided me.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:06.039
Today

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.639
is the first time I've seen you.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840
And the last.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.679
There are things
I need to say face-to-face.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.279
Gao won't take this money.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.519
It's not for you.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.559
It's for Gao Feng.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.480
I don't need him to remember me.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.000
I just want you all

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.080
to live like ordinary people

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.559
and forget about me.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.559
Even if you hadn't said this today,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.399
I'd already decided the same.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.039
Two families

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:09.759
sharing one child.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.240
Don't let the past generation's affair

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:15.360
drag down the next.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.279
Don't mind me being blunt.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.039
We're all doing this for Gao Feng.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.919
No mother can bear to leave her child.

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.639
But for the child,

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.519
she has to.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.919
Mrs. Gao.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I've had bad luck.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.970
I had the chance to give birth to him,

00:13:42.159 --> 00:13:43.000
but not to raise him.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.399
My life started off wrong.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.759
Gao Feng

00:13:54.679 --> 00:13:55.799
is luckier than I am.

00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.559
He'll live with you.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.679
Simple meals.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.559
Live a free and honest life.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:09.720
He'll live the life I wanted
but never had.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.480
That makes it all worth it.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.080
(In loving memory)

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.000
Mr. Xu, my condolences.

00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:36.919
May Mrs. Xu rest in peace.

00:14:45.159 --> 00:14:46.279
Yes. It was too sudden.

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:48.250
No one could've seen it coming.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.750
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.240
What are you going to do next?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.360
The company keeps expanding.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.280
Their people are everywhere now.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:05.919
With Shuqin gone,
things will be chaotic for a while.

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:08.919
I'll help you.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:09.690
Stay away from this.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:19.840
You're too visible.

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:22.039
If your ID shows up,
it'd draw attention.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:23.639
These are fake.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.960
Use them for hotels and travel.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.799
This one is mine.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.399
Use it for the report.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.600
If it really comes to that,

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:38.279
I'll use my real identity.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.279
(You have to learn to be brave.)

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:07.559
(You have a family now.)

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:09.600
(You're not alone.)

(This home)

00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:15.200

(How I wish)

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.720
(to wake you)

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:24.799
(at sunrise every day,)

(year after year.)

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.200
(I'm sorry.)

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:44.480
(Don't hate me.)

00:16:45.559 --> 00:16:46.679
(Don't remember me.)

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.039
(But I'll always remember you.)

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:53.600

00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:57.519
(Mom will always love you.)

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.320
You shouldn't have come.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160
Do you have everything?

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.400
I'm watching

00:17:08.039 --> 00:17:08.759
their side.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.839
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.620
Whether it works or not,

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.519
never come back.

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:18.920
Don't worry

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:20.319
about the boy.

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:22.720
You have to...

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:23.920
You have to live well too.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.920
Attention, passengers.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.400
Those traveling to
Tongyang and Huaiqing,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.720
boarding has begun.

00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:51.720
(If something happens to me,)

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680
(live on for our sake.)

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.980

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.480
Officers,

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:08.160
my name is Qu Feng.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:12.920
I filed a report under my real name

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:16.200
on the criminal activities
of Binchuan International Club.

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.440
Look at the words you used.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.400
Exploit.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.359
Oppress. Used.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.799
Imprison.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:25.960
Qu Meng,

00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:28.799
you only finished middle school, right?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.599
You even know how to write
"imprison", eh?

00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:34.920
Did that Yang fellow teach you that?

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:37.480
Qu Meng,

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:39.759
search your conscience

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:41.319
and think it through.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.200
The club helped you make money.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.720
Did anyone beat or yell at you?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.279
When you slept at night,
was anyone standing guard at your door?

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:52.599
Your legs were your own.

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:54.440
You could've walked away anytime.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.359
Is it fair for you
to accuse the club like this?

00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:58.599
Fine.

00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:01.839
I want to leave now.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.640
Will you let me go?

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.880
Things are different now.

00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:09.079
Mr. Xu,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.079
you decide.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.039
Mr. Xu.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.920
Kill me or spar me, it's up to you.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.960
You've done plenty of evil already.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.799
It'll all come to light sooner or later.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.519
I know the club is shutting down.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:38.200
Aren't you trying
to whitewash yourselves?

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:41.270
Then stop making things hard
for the girls.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:42.720
Let them go.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.680
Let them choose a new life
for themselves.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.200
Say something.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.599
What do you want?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.279
Like what you did to Yang Wenyuan?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.960
Anyone who knows
the truth about the club gets killed?

00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:02.519
Say it!

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.480
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.799
Answer me!

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.519
Choke me.

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.359
If I die,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.400
we're all free.

00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:59.039
If we're laying it all out,

00:23:00.359 --> 00:23:01.759
then everyone

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920
should be here.

00:23:07.599 --> 00:23:08.240
Hongyue.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.519
Hongyue, wake up.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.880
Hongyue.

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:14.039
What did you do to her?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.359
Thank you so much

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.799
for all these years.

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:27.980
Move the chair.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.640
This madwoman wouldn't listen,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.839
so I shot her up

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.279
to calm her down.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.640
She'll wake up after she hears
what we have to say today.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.119
She is your wife.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.799
Yes.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.960
I give her my heart,

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:08.319
but she dumps it in the gutter instead.

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:13.039
You only talk properly

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.079
after I go this far, huh?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.039
How have I wronged any of you?

00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:20.440
You.

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:21.920
We had a deal.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.000
You take care of the front.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.240
I take care of the back end.

00:24:25.359 --> 00:24:26.279
It was I

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:29.839
who turned you from a street vendor

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:32.640
into the biggest businessman
in Binchuan.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.599
You were shining out there.

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:37.559
I gave you all the face you wanted.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:38.559
Behind the scenes,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.640
you never lost a cent.

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:43.440
I even took care of your wife

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:44.839
and raised your son.

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:46.279
What did I ever do to deserve this?

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.680
And now you're pushing me out.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.880
Just because you heard

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.799
they're starting
to investigate the club.

00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:55.400
So you throw me out.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.279
Do you have no conscience?

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.400
And you.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.039
I turned you from a showgirl
into a manager.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:14.000
I helped you and the other girls
make real money.

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:16.480
I let you become a clean mother.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.000
What did I ever do to deserve this?

00:25:18.279 --> 00:25:20.519
Yet you keep siding with outsiders

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:24.079
over and over again.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.799
You are a jerk.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.480
Qu Meng,

00:25:33.519 --> 00:25:35.039
you should thank me.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.920
Take a good look

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.240
at this city.

00:25:42.079 --> 00:25:44.839
Compared to the nonsense
Yang Wenyuan told you,

00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:47.039
look at what we built.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.599
Which path actually worked?

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.640
Back when you went out
causing trouble with him,

00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:54.400
I could've crushed you
without leaving a trace.

00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:58.880
What did I ever do to deserve this?

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.640
Well, Wu.

00:26:02.559 --> 00:26:05.799
It's not that I wanted
to push you forward.

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:08.279
I was trying to save us.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.880
There are things
you just can't do anymore.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.160
I still have a son.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.960
You're scared? But I'm not.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.480
I didn't do that dirty business.

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.880
You gave the orders.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.039
(Contract, Xu Peng)
You signed all the papers.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:23.880
Go on.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.920
No. You forced me to sign.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.839
You kept threatening me with Shuqin.

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:32.680
But now Shuqin is gone.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.290
Worst case, I'll drag you down with me.
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.680
No. No. No.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.559
You have to fear me.

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.559
All of you have to fear me.

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:44.759
You must fear me.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.960
Hongyue, your girls' lives
are in my hands.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.119
You're afraid of me.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.960
Xu Peng,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.799
your son's life is in my hands.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.599
You're also afraid of me, aren't you?

00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:14.920
You're not.

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.920
You're afraid of nothing,

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:19.079
right?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.680
Wu.

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:26.440
Please. Let us go.

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:28.440
I'll do anything.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.960
This isn't the old days anymore.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.359
Our hands are tied now.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:34.920
But

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:40.240
someone has to take responsibility
for the things we did back then.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.119
I counted carefully.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.359
Out of all the tapes you stole,
only these three were missing.

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:48.279
Now we have them,

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.640
there'll be no threats then.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640
We're safe now.

00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:55.279
Xu Peng,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.960
your wife's been bedridden
for ten years.

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:01.200
Do you want your son

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.279
to live the same life
and be stuck in a bed?

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:05.960
You animal.

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:06.920
Animal.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.920
If we're transforming,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.119
let's do it completely.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.920
We did do dirty things

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.119
in the past.

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:41.359
But it was all ordered by you, Mr. Xu.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.759
So

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:46.119
you must take responsibility.

00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:48.599
As for how,

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:50.519
I hadn't figured that out.

00:28:52.599 --> 00:28:54.519
Qu Meng, thank you.

00:28:55.119 --> 00:28:57.359
Thank you for giving me an idea.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.799
Xu.

00:29:00.599 --> 00:29:02.519
Let's do it the way we planned.

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:04.480
Do her in.

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:09.359
Wu,

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:11.720
stop.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.759
Stop?

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.440
Stop?

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.519
I can't stop.

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:21.480
I can't.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.880
It's been impossible.

00:29:28.759 --> 00:29:30.279
I won't force you anymore.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.880
Think it through yourselves.

00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:33.599
Decide

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.279
what to do.

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:37.799
But if you still

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.279
want to stir things up,

00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.759
I'll play along.

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:45.920
I've made enough money for one lifetime.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.119
But our children,

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:51.200
my daughter, your son,

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.240
they must inherit clean money.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.039
Consider it carefully.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.880
Wu Guohao,

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.599
you'll get what you deserve.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.319
I'm not afraid.

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:08.039
I'm not.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.440
(Your wife's been bedridden
for ten years.)

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.839
(Do you want your son)

00:30:26.839 --> 00:30:28.920
(to live the same life
and be stuck in a bed?)

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.200
(Your son's life)

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:32.200
(is also in my hands.)

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.799
(But our children,)

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.799
(my daughter, your son,)

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.880
(they must inherit clean money.)

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.240
(Consider it carefully.)

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:11.240
I'm sorry,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.759
Qu Meng.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.560
The meeting starts now.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.319
I have two things to announce.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.480
Since the club was founded,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.240
there have been all kinds of rumors

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.640
going on.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.119
Before,

00:32:05.599 --> 00:32:08.599
I didn't put too many rules on you,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.960
as most of you were girls.

00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:13.559
But things are different now.

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.599
The company is transforming.

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:18.480
So from today on,

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:24.119
watch what you say and how you act.

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:28.000
You don't need to worry
about your future.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.960
The company will take care of you
until you grow old.

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:36.119
As long as Binchuan still exists,

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:39.440
as long as even one of you is alive,

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:43.799
I'll remain your general manager,

00:32:44.279 --> 00:32:45.559
your support,

00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:46.640
and

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:49.839
I'll feed you.

00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.200
Well said, Mr. Xu.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:01.319
That was great.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.839
Bury Qu Meng there.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.240
Let her stay with us.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.599
Then everyone can behave
and live quietly.

00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:52.880
When do we move her?

00:33:54.839 --> 00:33:55.960
Why move her?

00:33:56.519 --> 00:33:58.759
Before we die,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.640
and even after,

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:03.799
she'll stay right there.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:11.719
This woman

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.119
really needs some beatings.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:17.800
See? She's obedient now.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.610
She's not making trouble anymore.

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:22.199
Look at the girls under you.

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:23.800
Aren't they behaving now too?

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:26.880
Mr. Xu,

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.079
we're all in the same boat.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.199
We keep the secret

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:33.239
and share the risk together.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.039
Both of us must live well.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.800
Let's pray

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.639
for a better future.

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:16.480
Well?

00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:20.239
Awake now?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.639
Thought it through?

00:35:42.199 --> 00:35:42.960
What are you doing?

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:44.199
You beast!

00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:45.159
Feifei is only three.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.440
You want her to grow up
without a father?

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:49.800
You really want that?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.760
Why are you becoming like Qu Meng?

00:35:59.038 --> 00:36:01.918
Wu Guohao, you never hit me
like this before.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.039
You weren't like this.

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:05.840
Are you still that innocent woman?

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.639
I never changed.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.519
Did you ever love me?

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.360
Just let me be free.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.840
Impossible.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:39.679
You said you'd be my woman.

00:36:40.519 --> 00:36:41.679
You said you'd love me.

00:36:41.679 --> 00:36:43.580
You said you'd stay with me forever,
didn't you?

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:44.440
Didn't you?

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.639
You're not going anywhere.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.440
You're acting crazy all day.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.190
You don't get to see Feifei from now on.

00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:59.079
When you've thought it through,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.679
when you can be a respectable mother,

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.400
I'll let you out.

00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:19.639
(Ms. Hong,)

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:22.280
(you said you brought us here)

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.719
(so we could live better lives.)

00:37:27.239 --> 00:37:30.880
(You said women could
rely on themselves,)

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.039
(have their own homes,)

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.880
(and stop worrying about money.)

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.039
(I remember everything you said.)

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:43.000
(But Ms. Hong,)

00:37:43.679 --> 00:37:45.039
(you can't just survive.)

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:49.079
(There are better things
worth pursuing in life.)

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.400
(There should've been)

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.210

in this world.)

Wu Feifei, don't you want to know?

Gao Feng, I happened to pass by
your old place

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.960
after dinner earlier today.

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.039
I saw your mother

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.380
playing mahjong with the neighbors.

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:32.239
Muke Bar has reopened as well.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.100
After everything you and Long Yu
went through,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.119
you should understand each other
better now.

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:41.639
You should be able to live well.

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.440
Don't you think your life is better now?

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.690
I think living well right now
matters more than anything.

00:41:53.199 --> 00:41:54.119
Stop lying to yourself.

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:55.880
We're the same.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.280
We can't go back anymore.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.079
Have you ever thought about
when things went out of control?

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.320
Was it when your mom
tried to ram the statue

00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:06.000
and led me to look into my own mother?

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.920
Or when your mom chose
not to call the police

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:09.519
and died alone in that attic?

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:12.480
Or before any of this happened,

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.480
when fate brought us together?

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.039
Listen.

00:42:16.039 --> 00:42:18.079
If I'd never stepping into
this mess with you,

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.199
I'd still be that happy,

00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:23.199
obedient daughter.

00:42:24.159 --> 00:42:26.000
My dad would still be a good father.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.480
None of this would have anything
to do with me.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.760
You were the catalyst,

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.719
you know?

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:36.840
Sometimes I wonder,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.440
if I hadn't gone

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.599
drinking with you that day,

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.519
would everything

00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:46.039
be different now?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.000
Sometimes I really wish

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.039
we had never met.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.119
It's now basically confirmed

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.400
that back in the 1990s,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:08.000
the person responsible
for the illegal sex trade

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.039
at the International Club was Xu Peng.

00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:12.599
Among the surveillance tapes
submitted by Xu Zhiyang,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.639
one clearly shows

00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:18.079
how Xu Peng killed Qu Meng.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.079
After forensic verification,

00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:22.679
the footage has been confirmed
to be authentic.

00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:25.159
Looks like

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.440
this case has come to an end.
