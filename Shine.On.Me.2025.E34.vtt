(Taihu High-end Medical Center)

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.919
Let's have a simple meal.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.260
Lately,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.699
you've been exhausted.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.859
After dinner,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.639
stay home for the night.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.960
Don't return to Suzhou.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.620
You too, Lin.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.100
No more trips.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.419
The guest room

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:06.320
is ready.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.064
What?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.560
I've already said it.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:14.859
Need Xiguang's approval?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.672
No,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.239
I'm just a bit worried.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.060
Thank you.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:53.859
Dad,

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.239
does it hurt?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.660
Let me blow on it for you.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.600
Doesn't hurt.

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.088
Xiguang,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.019
where's Mom?

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.720
Mom's downstairs on a call,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.000
arguing with someone.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:06.480
Arguing?

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.019
Do you know who?

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.239
No.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.399
But Mom is really good at it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.079
Mom won the argument.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.079
Who were you arguing?

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.940
I didn't.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.699
I just spoke a bit louder.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:22.579
Huang?

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.639
What's he stirring up now?

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.260
It's all settled.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.699
Just focus on recovering.

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:28.660
Stop worrying.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.976
Mom and Dad will pick up Xiguang.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.199
I'll stay.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.720
No need. I can manage alone.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.799
This illness is work-induced.

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:36.980
Badge of over-exertion.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.579
I'll take care of you.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.128
What?

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:41.619
If not work-induced,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.579
you won't?

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.079
Don't twist my words.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.760
Lin,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.460
come on in.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.419
Make yourself at home.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.480
No worries.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.496
Okay, Ms. Jiang.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:24.819
These

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.119
are Xiguang's uncle's slippers.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.359
Wear them for now.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.879
Later, I'll have Xiguang

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.200
buy some for your own use.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:31.679
Thanks, Ms. Jiang.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.439
I can bring my own.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.080
In Wuxi,

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:43.299
we do sell slippers.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.499
No need to bring yours.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.160
The guest room is ready,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.059
but the housekeeper isn't here.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.059
You two need

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:52.040
to tidy up yourselves.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.216
Xiguang,

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:53.980
help Lin

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.100
get the quilt and pillows.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.379
I'm fine now.

00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:19.460
Today,

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:21.600
I made a mistake.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.540
What mistake?

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.739
Next time you go see your dad,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.720
I'll go with you.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.679
Even if you go with me,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.759
there's nothing you can do.

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:42.319
At least, I can

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.259
take some heat.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.900
Plus, Mr. Nie cares about face.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.280
If I'm there,

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:49.439
he'll hold back.

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:51.540
Let him hold it in.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.700
During dinner just now,

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.780
I was thinking

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:09.559
I might be a bit too much.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.919
How come?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.819
You just stated the truth.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.179
Mr. Nie's mood was already bad.

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:18.780
If you hadn't explained,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.759
for the police and rumors,

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:22.359
he'd be angrier inside.

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:23.780
That would be worse.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:25.619
Not towards him,

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:28.600
but you.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:30.368
Me?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.900
My dad has always
had a bias against you.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.160
But these days,

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:36.720
I've been

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.819
sending his medical records

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.419
to you for your opinion.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.379
I never considered

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.239
your feelings.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.900
It would be a problem

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.419
if you didn't.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.460
Couples

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:50.688
should support

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.160
and rely on each other.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.100
If you don't trust me

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.140
or rely on me

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.640
in my field,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.119
I'd be disappointed.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.799
Is that so?

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:02.859
Of course.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:06.900
Actually, these days,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.460
I've organized the plan

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.119
for the surgery.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.559
Assuming I were performing the surgery,

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:12.580
how would I do it?

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.040
What position would I use?

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.119
Once Dr. Schneider arrives,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.179
we can go see him together

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.140
and hear his surgical plan.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:25.999
Thank you.

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:28.900
If you insist on saying thanks,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.840
I'll accept it.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.600
But

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.640
help me solve a practical

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:35.379
problem first.

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:37.312
What?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.580
Your bedsheet design

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.379
is illogical.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.259
No matter how I turn it,

00:07:41.679 --> 00:07:42.319
it seems short.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.700
Really?

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.419
You hold that end. Let me see.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:53.824
Let me check.

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:00.700
It really is!

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.540
How was the sheet

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.439
designed?

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:04.840
Why is it square?

00:08:05.379 --> 00:08:06.840
This should be at the headboard.

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:08.900
No, this side should be the head.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.239
I just noticed it has lace

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.200
on three sides.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.200
Really!

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:14.580
Listen to me.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.619
Just do this.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:16.919
See?

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:17.679
Seems correct now.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.759
My observational skills

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:20.739
are sharp, right?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.379
This is the kitchen.

00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:29.720
If you get hungry at night,

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.840
just raid the fridge.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.619
It's my first visit.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.300
Don't tempt me into mischief.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.960
There seems

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.279
nothing ideal for midnight snacking.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.180
When I'm away,

00:08:46.619 --> 00:08:48.019
does the fridge get this empty?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.820
It's fine.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.340
I've got this.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.899
It's my secret stash.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.848
Thanks.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.128
Let's go.

00:09:12.379 --> 00:09:13.039
I'll show you

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:13.800
my mom's flowers.

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:21.899
Look.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.320
My mom mainly grows

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:33.420
phalaenopsis orchids.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.619
Guess why?

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:37.639
Not because she likes them?

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.359
It's because they're easy!

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.060
It's all she can keep alive.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.519
It's May already,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.619
but these orchids

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:50.499
have so many blooms.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.300
She must have some talent
for this after all.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.779
Don't insult her.

00:09:55.359 --> 00:09:56.279
She's not here.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.639
She can't hear you flatter her.

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:00.460
It's practice.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.340
I'll say it again at breakfast tomorrow.

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:10.240
(Dad: Xiguang,
sorry for what happened today)

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.320
(Xiguang,)

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.980
(sorry for what)

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.239
(happened today.)

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.560
(I don't distrust you.)

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:21.560
(It's just that I've)

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.300
(been feeling low
due to illness lately,)

00:10:23.619 --> 00:10:25.019
(and often can't control myself.)

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.639
(I said many hurtful things today.)

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.300
(They were unintentional.)

00:10:29.899 --> 00:10:30.840
(You must never doubt)

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:32.999
(that in this world,)

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.180
(I love you the most.)

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.279
(I'll think)

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.539
(about what you said.)

00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:48.920
My dad sent me a message apologizing.

00:10:51.659 --> 00:10:52.720
But somehow,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.460
I couldn't easily

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:57.460
reply with "It's okay."

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.060
But he's

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.259
so seriously ill.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:03.940
I just couldn't bear...

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:09.700
I understand.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.279
I've been through

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:16.320
this before.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.460
Your grandpa?

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:23.872
Yes.

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:29.856
Come on.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.320
Let's go downstairs

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.499
for some air.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.239
I told you before.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.600
Before the exam,

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:41.840
someone told me

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.779
how my father died.

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.659
So I moved out of my grandpa's place.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.340
You said that later,

00:11:51.119 --> 00:11:52.259
after seeing so much death

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.940
at the hospital,

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:55.139
you learned to let go.

00:11:57.739 --> 00:11:58.920
But before letting go,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.560
I went through turmoil too.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.100
I remember back then,

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.600
not long after I moved out,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.980
my grandpa got very sick

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:13.879
and needed surgery.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.580
Mr. Li called me,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.159
hoping I'd visit him.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:20.920
I rushed to the hospital.

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:23.320
I sat at the entrance

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:25.480
alone until dawn.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:29.759
At last, I didn't go in.

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.080
I didn't leave until Mr. Li

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:35.039
told me the surgery

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.800
succeeded.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.800
Everything involving emotions

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.999
may be unsolvable.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.800
Only time will tell.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.940
But the younger me

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.999
made

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:02.859
a naive vow.

00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:05.480
What vow?

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.379
Although a bit childish,

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:12.519
I believe

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.820
I'll hold on to it.

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:22.220
Back when I was 15,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:23.700
I told myself

00:13:25.239 --> 00:13:25.879
that I must

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.019
be good to those I love.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.499
Whether it's family

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:31.359
or a partner.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:33.800
I want the ones I love

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.639
to never suffer

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.999
because of moral dilemmas

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:42.019
and emotional conflicts caused by me.

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:57.180
I was trying to comfort you.

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:58.659
Why did it backfire

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.200
and make you cry?

00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:04.920
No,

00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:07.800
I was just thinking

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:08.920
of you,

00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:11.239
only 15,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.659
so small,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.659
sitting alone on the steps

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.580
all night long.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.119
It breaks my heart.

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:24.680
I can do it too.

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:25.680
Yusen,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.220
I will also make sure

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:31.220
that after 30, Lin Yusen

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.399
never suffers

00:14:35.739 --> 00:14:37.039
from moral dilemmas

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.920
and emotional conflicts
because of his loved ones.

00:14:45.739 --> 00:14:46.300
Okay.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.080
But,

00:15:08.659 --> 00:15:09.680
there's a crucial detail

00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:10.639
I need to correct.

00:15:11.539 --> 00:15:12.379
What is it?

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.659
The 15-year-old me

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:19.060
was already six feet tall.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.420
I wasn't small.

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:13.779
Maybe later,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.920
send a simple message.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.279
Not for others,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.600
just for yourself.

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:23.659
That way,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.960
you might feel better

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.999
and won't agonize over it.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:35.999
And then,

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:37.619
get some proper rest.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.899
Every day you wake up from now on,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.912
I'll be there.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:45.019
Yusen,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.539
although

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:53.139
I was a little bit late,

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:57.060
from now on,

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:00.680
you'll always have me.

00:17:34.239 --> 00:17:35.180
Grandma, I'm fine.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.739
Yusen and I

00:17:36.779 --> 00:17:37.999
are on our way back to Suzhou.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.019
We have a meeting at ten.

00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:41.480
Xiguang,

00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:42.599
if your work is busy,

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.059
don't travel back and forth.

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.099
This morning,

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.839
I got a call from your dad.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:48.299
He apologized to me.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.799
Your grandpa and I

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.079
came to see him at the hospital.

00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:52.739
Grandpa wanted to scold him,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.460
but seeing how he looks now,

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:55.480
he just couldn't do it.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.819
What can we do? He's our own child.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.079
But I notice

00:18:00.339 --> 00:18:02.200
he's much calmer today.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.140
Probably because you

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.819
scolded him yesterday and woke him up.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.460
Seems like he's reflecting a bit.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.920
As long as it doesn't affect

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.839
his upcoming surgery.

00:18:12.339 --> 00:18:13.819
It won't. It's good for him.

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:15.480
He was irritable the past few days.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.480
Terrible temper.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.160
The doctors kept telling us

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.900
to keep him calm

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.920
and comfort him.

00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:23.039
But nothing we said worked.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.519
Now, by some twist of fate,

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.720
he's quieted down,

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.559
not throwing tantrums anymore either.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:29.900
That's good.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:32.460
Xiguang,

00:18:33.239 --> 00:18:34.259
there's something

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.900
I've been meaning to ask,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.420
but now I'm too embarrassed
to bring it up.

00:18:38.819 --> 00:18:40.299
What is it, Grandma? You can tell me.

00:18:41.559 --> 00:18:43.200
You said before that Lin

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.920
is a very skilled surgeon.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.519
I was thinking,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.160
when that foreign doctor arrives,

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:50.059
could he

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:50.940
help us

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.819
communicate with the foreign doctor?

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:55.059
We don't understand anything!

00:18:55.559 --> 00:18:56.559
Though we have advisors,

00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:58.900
it's never as reassuring
as having Lin there.

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:01.279
But,

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:02.559
after everything,

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.299
I feel too embarrassed

00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:05.480
to make this request.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.059
Grandma,

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:09.799
Yusen has been looking over Dad's

00:19:09.839 --> 00:19:10.880
medical records.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.896
He's provided many insights.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.319
When the plan comes in,

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.480
he will also help review it.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.880
Grandma,

00:19:24.239 --> 00:19:25.299
whether it's for you

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.900
or my duty as a former doctor,

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.319
I will do my best.

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:30.539
Lin,

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.180
thank you so much.

00:19:39.296 --> 00:19:42.368
(One Month Later, Nanjing)

00:19:42.656 --> 00:19:44.420
(Nanjing Cheng Rui
Architectural Design Firm)

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.160
Today's meeting

00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:47.120
is not for opinions.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.720
No discussions.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.680
I'm just here to present to you

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.900
the final design.

00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:54.319
Wang, good to see you.

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:55.559
Haven't seen you

00:19:55.579 --> 00:19:56.700
this spirited for long.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.579
No matter where he comes from,

00:19:59.099 --> 00:19:59.940
I'm now confident

00:20:00.339 --> 00:20:01.099
to compete.

00:20:01.339 --> 00:20:02.279
Well said, Mr. Wang!

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:04.319
Let's gear up.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.999
Next week's bid opening,

00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:07.279
we're going to win it!

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.400
The bid opening is in Suzhou,

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:12.192
early next Saturday morning.

00:20:12.499 --> 00:20:13.519
We plan to stay

00:20:13.739 --> 00:20:14.660
in Suzhou on Friday.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.140
It's in Suzhou?

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:17.279
That's perfect!

00:20:17.539 --> 00:20:18.680
At that time, Yusen and I

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.400
will see you off.

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:20.480
That's wonderful!

00:20:21.059 --> 00:20:22.799
It's a pity Feng Teng has restrictions

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:23.900
on attendees,

00:20:24.499 --> 00:20:25.200
or I was planning

00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:26.180
to take you all along.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.339
We certainly can't take that risk.

00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:31.519
Sheng Xingjie is probably watching us,

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:32.599
looking for a slip-up.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.140
If he reports us,

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:35.319
we'll be disqualified.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.599
Don't talk about that.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.819
Your generation is so superstitious.

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:41.200
You youngsters

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:43.239
are fearless out of ignorance.

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:47.440
Why isn't Yusen here today?

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:49.980
He is working overtime this morning

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:50.860
for next month's

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.239
equipment installation.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.519
He'll go to Shanghai this afternoon
to meet Professor Xi.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.660
He's joining the institute?

00:20:58.059 --> 00:20:58.688
Yes.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.519
He spends a lot of time every day

00:21:00.539 --> 00:21:01.259
on it now.

00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:02.660
But he didn't neglect

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.380
factory matters.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.200
He's incredibly energetic.

00:21:06.739 --> 00:21:07.380
Yeah.

00:21:08.299 --> 00:21:09.620
Not tired even working two jobs.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.660
Probably a perpetual machine.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.660
Right, how's your dad doing?

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.220
It's been a while.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.160
Is he discharged?

00:21:18.579 --> 00:21:19.460
Not yet.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:20.680
He's doing rehab there.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.739
How's his recovery going then?

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:29.200
The surgery itself was very successful,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.680
but this condition is tricky.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.940
Even after successfully
removing the tumor,

00:21:34.239 --> 00:21:35.799
hearing is still affected.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.739
It probably won't fully return
to how it was.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.839
But preserving some hearing

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:41.599
is very fortunate.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.900
The facial paralysis is improved too.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.059
Your dad

00:21:47.579 --> 00:21:48.559
is a very proud man.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.660
It must be hard for him.

00:21:53.319 --> 00:21:54.019
It's fine now.

00:21:55.099 --> 00:21:55.999
His mood

00:21:56.019 --> 00:21:56.900
is stable right now.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.019
True.

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:00.799
After such a serious illness,

00:22:01.299 --> 00:22:02.539
people do change.

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:31.360
The accuracy rate

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:32.360
is getting better.

00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:36.999
How long do I have to train?

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.259
Overall, rehabilitation
takes about six weeks.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.019
However,

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:43.279
if it progresses well,

00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:44.900
you can continue training

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:45.860
at home later on.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.799
Neural rehabilitation

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:48.960
is a very lengthy process.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.016
Take it slow.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.519
What about

00:22:52.779 --> 00:22:53.920
the level of recovery?

00:22:54.319 --> 00:22:54.819
It depends

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.940
on your specific progress.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.920
But you need

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.160
to brace yourself mentally.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:01.579
Rest for a while.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.519
Later,

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:03.420
we'll continue

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.900
the facial rehabilitation.

00:23:09.079 --> 00:23:09.700
Mr. Nie.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.200
Xu.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.299
I'm here today

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.200
to update you

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.140
on the Intelligent Digital Center bid

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:14.839
of Feng Teng.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:16.288
Take a look.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.339
Chengyuan,

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:19.299
Xiguang's here.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.448
Dad.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.559
Take a seat.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.839
Have some fruit.

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:25.880
I'll finish this quickly.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.259
Rest more.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.680
Don't worry about the company.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.640
I'm just listening to the update.

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:31.900
Yes, ma'am.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.019
I'm almost done.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.339
The bid opening

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.299
is scheduled

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.499
for next Saturday

00:23:37.579 --> 00:23:38.480
in Suzhou.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.839
Should we...

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.120
Maybe I should leave

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.420
and come back later.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.440
What's wrong?

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:45.759
Uncle and Aunt

00:23:45.839 --> 00:23:46.579
are also bidding

00:23:46.579 --> 00:23:47.559
for this project.

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:48.960
I think

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:49.819
I'll wait outside.

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:51.660
You're not involved.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.660
Why leave?

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.779
That's not good.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.839
After all, I know both sides.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.200
What if there's any

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.239
information leakage

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.299
and you suspect me?

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.120
Xu,

00:24:03.499 --> 00:24:04.980
please go out and wait for a moment.

00:24:05.259 --> 00:24:05.999
Okay.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.059
I'll go cut some fruit for you.

00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:15.900
Are you blaming me

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.099
for what happened last time?

00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:19.239
Things happened fast,

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.360
and I was a bit rash,

00:24:21.579 --> 00:24:22.360
wronging you.

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:24.559
I apologize.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.536
No,

00:24:25.739 --> 00:24:27.319
it really is better to stay out of it.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:30.460
Cheng Rui

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.460
simply has no chance of winning the bid.

00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:33.599
Why so stubborn?

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.099
Even if you told them

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:36.099
the bottom line

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:36.860
of the bid,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.099
with their strength,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:38.920
their proposal

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.279
wouldn't score high enough.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.360
How do you know

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.680
Uncle and Aunt can't make it?

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:44.200
Let's be realistic.

00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:46.059
Look at the other companies bidding.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:47.440
Which one isn't better

00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:48.640
than Cheng Rui?

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:49.940
Sheng Yuan

00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:51.239
is determined to win.

00:24:51.819 --> 00:24:52.460
Earlier on,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.079
Sheng Bokai even called me,

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:55.579
trying to ask me to rig the bid.

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:57.360
Isn't that illegal?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.680
You know bid rigging?

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:00.579
Of course.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.620
Just a group of people

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.579
occupying the slots.

00:25:02.739 --> 00:25:03.980
Except for the decided winner,

00:25:04.239 --> 00:25:05.140
everyone else

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.360
half-hearts their proposal

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.799
and colludes on their prices
to ensure that one wins.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.999
I heard you talk about it

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.099
when I was little.

00:25:12.579 --> 00:25:14.059
Understand it in just a few words?

00:25:14.319 --> 00:25:15.480
Impressive.

00:25:16.739 --> 00:25:17.499
You really are

00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:19.019
inheriting my business acumen.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.660
If anything, it's from Mom.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.400
So you agreed?

00:25:25.339 --> 00:25:27.539
Feng Teng Group isn't some pushover.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.999
How could they let such

00:25:29.299 --> 00:25:31.019
petty tactics slide easily?

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.120
They spotted the irregularities.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:33.880
However,

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.759
out of respect for Mr. Sheng,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.839
they just gave a private warning.

00:25:39.099 --> 00:25:40.819
Seeing his first scheme fail,

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.480
Sheng Bokai spent heavily

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.200
to bring in

00:25:44.239 --> 00:25:45.620
the top international architect

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.460
Du Lan.

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:48.680
With a master like that,

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:50.680
how can Cheng Rui possibly compete?

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:52.960
Leaving Sheng Yuan aside,

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:54.519
our Yuan Cheng Group

00:25:54.579 --> 00:25:55.420
has deep expertise

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.880
in design and construction

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.599
that Cheng Rui can't match.

00:25:58.819 --> 00:25:59.739
So I say Cheng Rui

00:25:59.779 --> 00:26:00.940
has no chance of winning.

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:02.299
Purely a business judgment.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.940
They shouldn't

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.739
be wasting time

00:26:04.739 --> 00:26:06.120
and effort on this project.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.079
Xiguang,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.880
now that you're working,

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.420
remember this.

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:14.680
Business world is a battlefield.

00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:16.319
Be ruthless.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.799
Always stay rational.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.599
You must never let emotions

00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:22.400
cloud your judgment and decisions.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:24.519
Point taken.

00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:28.992
(Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center
Bid Opening Meeting)

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:30.640
Yes.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.720
When we'll get inside,

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:33.200
let's follow the procedures.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.279
Don't forget.

00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:38.368
Xiguang,

00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:39.980
just drop us off here.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:40.920
Don't wait for us.

00:26:41.339 --> 00:26:43.440
We don't know when
the bid opening will end.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.408
And once inside,
phones will be handed over.

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:46.680
We will lose touch.

00:26:47.079 --> 00:26:47.680
Okay.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:48.339
Aunt,

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:49.980
will the business bid open today?

00:26:51.099 --> 00:26:52.279
According to the documents,

00:26:52.339 --> 00:26:52.999
it's today.

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:54.120
That's for the best.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.860
If it drags on,

00:26:55.239 --> 00:26:56.220
there may be foul play.

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:57.099
So we'll know

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.860
the result today.

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.592
Yes.

00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:24.140
Why isn't he

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.160
making threats today?

00:27:25.499 --> 00:27:26.680
He must be scared of us.

00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:28.519
Seems like it.

00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:30.900
How boring.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.739
You two...

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:34.700
Alright, we're heading in.

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:35.880
Behave.

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:36.599
Go back now.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.239
See you in Suzhou tonight.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.339
Don't worry, Aunt.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.499
We already made plans.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:42.560
Okay.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.180
Then we're going in.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:44.928
Okay.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.779
Good luck, Aunt.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.816
Okay.

00:27:47.259 --> 00:27:48.064
Good luck, Mr. Wang.

00:27:48.704 --> 00:27:49.279
Let's go.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:49.920
Good luck!

00:27:56.559 --> 00:27:57.720
What plans do we have?

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:58.579
Why didn't I know?

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.259
Well.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.799
There's a property

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:02.620
I'm interested in.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.440
How about we take a look?

00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:05.632
What...

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:06.779
Houses?

00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:24.460
Did you plan this all along?

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:26.656
Yes.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.599
Long planned.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.360
Hello.

00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:33.120
You must be Mr. Lin and Ms. Nie?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.080
Yes.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:34.779
Welcome!

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:35.980
I've been waiting.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.180
Please.

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:39.079
Let me introduce

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:39.999
our property to you.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.099
Our Lakeview Villa

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.660
is situated on the most beautiful
shoreline of Cheng Lake.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.839
It's a low-density,
exclusive villa community.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.019
The greenery ratio

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:50.860
reaches 60 percent.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.319
Originally, we launched

00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:53.239
16 villas.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.120
Each one

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.839
boasts prime lake views.

00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:57.539
Out of the private garden,

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.779
you can walk by the lake.

00:28:59.319 --> 00:29:00.032
Come here.

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.259
The design

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:02.720
was crafted by a top-tier team,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.160
creating the rare

00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:05.640
Chinese minimalist style.

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:09.799
The house and lake scenery
blend perfectly,

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:12.099
exuding a unique Jiangnan charm.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.360
(Lakeview Villa)
Look.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.920
It has complete amenities nearby.

00:29:15.279 --> 00:29:16.720
Hospitals, international schools,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.440
everything.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.319
Are you looking to invest?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.779
But this place

00:29:20.779 --> 00:29:22.279
is a bit remote, isn't it?

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.680
Our company

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.920
is on the edge of the park.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.620
This is even more remote.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.860
Not for investment.

00:29:30.099 --> 00:29:30.839
For us to live in.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.120
To live in?

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.239
It's remote here,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.039
but it's only

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.160
a 15-minute drive

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.039
to our company.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.400
But you'll be

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.680
working in Shanghai later.

00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.420
You're at Guang Yu.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:45.920
Me?

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.952
You have a laser pointer?

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:50.799
Of course.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:52.940
Here.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.839
When I first met Professor Xi,

00:29:57.239 --> 00:29:57.999
she told me

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.799
that Shanghai's new

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:01.824
Brain Science Research Center
will be in Songjiang.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.360
(Songjiang District)
Roughly around here.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.120
Driving

00:30:05.499 --> 00:30:06.620
from here to the institute

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.640
takes about 50 minutes.

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:09.660
Guang Yu is located here.

00:30:09.728 --> 00:30:10.360
(Industrial Park)

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.220
This community

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.579
is right

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.599
between our workplaces.

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.579
So this is where I imagine

00:30:17.019 --> 00:30:18.259
we would live.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.599
Then our house

00:30:24.599 --> 00:30:26.360
would be perfect for you newlyweds.

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:27.999
I swear

00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:29.539
no other place has

00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:30.380
a better location.

00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:34.039
Not necessarily.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.720
There are two more

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.160
we could go check out.

00:30:38.739 --> 00:30:40.259
But they aren't as good as here.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:42.120
We have in-house

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:43.339
property management.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.799
Exceptional service quality.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:45.860
In autumn,

00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:48.220
residents get free crabs.

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:55.239
You really have been

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.380
planning this for a long time.

00:31:00.579 --> 00:31:02.319
I've been secretly
researching all along.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.519
Alright then.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.960
To honor your research,

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.799
we'll go

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.599
check them out one by one.

00:31:13.099 --> 00:31:14.759
We have plenty of time today anyway.

00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:16.539
Wait.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.499
Well, besides the crabs,

00:31:18.579 --> 00:31:19.819
we also have discounts.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.759
Plus, it's move-in ready.
No waiting needed.

00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:23.239
Mr. Lin, you've done your homework.

00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:24.099
You know

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:25.920
other properties take at least a year.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:27.180
Ours is ready now.

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:28.579
What you see is what you get.

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:30.360
Actually,

00:31:30.819 --> 00:31:31.660
we aren't married.

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:33.759
But she calls

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.739
the shots.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.739
Just convince her.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.239
Miss,

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.660
trust me.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.860
You can certainly

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.200
look at other communities.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.019
But

00:31:47.319 --> 00:31:48.860
(Lakeview Villa)
ours is definitely the best!

00:31:50.099 --> 00:31:50.940
We're closest to your

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.499
workplace.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.779
Look along this route.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.559
Other villas are closer

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.140
to Shanghai.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.339
You'd have

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.319
a longer commute.

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.279
Your fiancé surely won't like that,

00:31:59.739 --> 00:32:00.239
right?

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.499
You have a point there.

00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:09.980
So please take us

00:32:10.039 --> 00:32:11.079
to see the actual place.

00:32:11.339 --> 00:32:11.904
Come on.

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:12.539
Please.

00:32:16.608 --> 00:32:19.936
(Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center
Bid Opening Meeting)

00:32:27.968 --> 00:32:29.888
(Suzhou Intelligent Digital Center
Bid Opening Meeting)

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.099
It shouldn't be over yet.

00:32:32.339 --> 00:32:33.579
Aunt hasn't texted me.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.779
So phones are still locked.

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:36.440
Let's sit here.

00:32:39.079 --> 00:32:40.299
Failure isn't rare.

00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:42.799
Losers need grace too.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.960
You helped outsiders harm
the group's interests.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.059
I will report

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.180
everything to Grandpa.

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:01.239
Cheng Rui won the bid?

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:04.739
Thanks for telling us the good news.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:06.960
Xingjie,

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.880
though you lost this time,

00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:10.319
you gained the courage

00:33:10.599 --> 00:33:11.579
to personally report

00:33:11.599 --> 00:33:12.420
to the Chairman.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.299
I believe the Chairman

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:16.200
will be proud of your growth.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.360
You just wait.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.339
I'll be waiting.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.299
Well done.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.180
Always.

00:33:38.339 --> 00:33:39.440
Based on what Xingjie said,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.239
Aunt's team won, right?

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.360
100 percent.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.799
That's great!

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:47.160
Aunt!

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:47.980
Xiguang!

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:50.420
We got it!

00:33:52.739 --> 00:33:53.640
We just heard about it

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.940
from a livid

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:55.599
Sheng Xingjie.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.739
Ms. Shen, hold it together.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:57.792
People are watching.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:33:59.999
This is me holding back.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.759
Or I'd be jumping for joy.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.660
Xiguang, Lin,

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:04.900
thank you.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.640
And Mr. Zhang, Mr. Hua.

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:07.660
Thank your company.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:08.880
This time,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.139
you've helped us a lot.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.240
In fact,

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.480
you are the key to victory.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:13.240
The committee

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.740
was impressed by the concept
of green energy efficiency.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.980
Our design proposal

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.119
scored top marks.

00:34:18.499 --> 00:34:20.139
We merely played a supporting role.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.900
Cheng Rui's team is exceptional

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.880
with a brilliant design.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.820
Oh, you.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:24.920
At such a time,

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.519
what's with the modesty?

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.579
Didn't you have other plans?

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.420
Why are you waiting here?

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.696
Sorry for the trouble.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400
Not at all.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.280
We actually went out and got back.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:37.880
Just got back.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:38.780
Yes, Aunt.

00:34:39.039 --> 00:34:39.860
We didn't wait long.

00:34:40.099 --> 00:34:41.260
We just went to buy a house.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:44.840
Buy a house?

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:53.760
Feng Teng Group just announced

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.579
the winner of the bid

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:57.179
is Nanjing Cheng Rui.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.599
Is that Jiang Ping's company?

00:35:03.159 --> 00:35:03.719
Yes.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:04.880
Furthermore,

00:35:04.999 --> 00:35:06.579
Cheng Rui won this bid

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.840
largely

00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:09.019
because Shuangyuan

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:10.119
designed for them

00:35:10.219 --> 00:35:11.119
a building-integrated

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:12.320
solar power system.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.800
They impressed the committee

00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:15.960
with their green,

00:35:16.219 --> 00:35:17.719
energy-saving, and low-carbon design.

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:23.079
Dad.

00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:27.648
Dad.

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:30.940
You're not a kid anymore.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.420
Stop running around like a clueless fly

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.039
all day.

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:36.128
Dad,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.440
Xingjie...

00:35:37.499 --> 00:35:38.219
Enough.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.940
I won't blame him.

00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.539
After all, he is my eldest grandson.

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:45.199
He lacks the capability
to manage the business.

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:47.219
In the future, being a wealthy idler

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:47.760
isn't bad.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.120
Dad,

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:51.039
give Xingjie another chance.

00:35:51.679 --> 00:35:52.840
This was just an accident.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.260
You can't write him off completely

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:57.240
based on one loss.

00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:58.099
Besides,

00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.960
if it weren't for Yusen

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.760
and his betrayal,

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:02.219
taking your resources

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.619
to help outsiders,

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.079
Xingjie wouldn't have

00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:06.219
lost this project.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:07.760
One loss?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.760
Be honest. How many times?

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.900
Mobilizing the entire group,

00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:13.539
he was effortlessly outplayed

00:36:13.699 --> 00:36:14.960
and utterly crushed.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.800
And he has the nerve to complain?

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.219
Losing is losing.

00:36:18.679 --> 00:36:19.820
He doesn't have the dignity

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:21.280
to accept defeat.

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:22.740
He'll never succeed.

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:24.039
Get out of my sight!

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:24.900
Dad.

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:25.659
Bokai,

00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:27.440
I think you should go back now.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.139
Many years ago,

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.340
I thought talents

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.559
like Yusen's father

00:37:05.719 --> 00:37:06.820
were common.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.619
Now I realize

00:37:13.059 --> 00:37:14.940
they are one in ten thousand.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.679
In the entire Sheng Yuan,

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.780
I can't find a single descendant

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.760
I can entrust it to.

00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:30.336
(General)

00:37:33.499 --> 00:37:34.119
Li.

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:36.360
In a few days,

00:37:37.119 --> 00:37:38.340
we'll go to Suzhou.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.904
Okay.

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:44.320
Last time Xiguang visited me,

00:37:44.719 --> 00:37:45.380
you were there.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.780
Looking at it now,

00:37:47.059 --> 00:37:48.559
back then, she had been involved

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:49.900
in Cheng Rui's design proposal.

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:51.800
At that time,

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.199
did you notice it?

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:54.760
I left very quickly back then.

00:37:55.499 --> 00:37:56.440
I can't remember.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.059
So,

00:37:58.159 --> 00:37:59.280
you didn't notice either.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.380
Not your fault.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.579
She didn't slip up at all.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.944
Good.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.659
Well done.

00:38:09.499 --> 00:38:11.260
Sheng Bokai schemed carefully

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.599
to push his son into power.

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:13.760
Didn't expect

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.559
my daughter outmaneuvered

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:16.480
him effortlessly.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.480
Truly my daughter.

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:21.360
As they say, like father, like daughter.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.019
It's in the blood.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:24.840
But

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:26.380
will Bokai at Sheng Yuan

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.980
hold a grudge against you?

00:38:28.539 --> 00:38:29.980
Yuan Cheng didn't win either.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.599
Why hold a grudge against me?

00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:32.579
Besides,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.260
his son proved so useless.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.360
Whether he can maintain

00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:37.599
his position at Sheng Yuan

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:38.499
is hard to tell.

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:39.940
Don't worry.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.639
Just say a few pleasant things

00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:43.780
to keep up appearances.

00:38:44.019 --> 00:38:44.608
Okay.

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:46.784
Mr. Nie,

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:48.736
time to go to the hospital for therapy.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:49.960
Mr. Nie,

00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:50.900
please rest well.

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:51.920
I'll go handle

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.519
the follow-ups.

00:38:58.199 --> 00:38:59.300
What is it? Tell me.

00:39:00.519 --> 00:39:02.219
The South City Villa management called.

00:39:02.499 --> 00:39:04.159
They said this year's fee is not paid.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:05.019
So...

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.420
After all, the South City Villa
is under my name.

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:12.360
It's not appropriate for others

00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.059
to keep living there.

00:39:14.499 --> 00:39:15.460
Go handle it.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.300
Mr. Nie,

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.039
so you mean...

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.099
Bad location.

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:21.240
Sell it.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.168
Yes.

00:39:25.179 --> 00:39:26.119
Do you think I'm being

00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:26.940
too harsh?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.460
O-Of course not.

00:39:29.179 --> 00:39:30.179
Mr. Nie, you treated

00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:32.159
Ms. Qian with all due consideration.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.880
But she used your name
to provide guarantees.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.519
Then she called the police
without telling you.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:39.659
You can't indulge her anymore.

00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:41.760
That makes sense.

00:39:42.679 --> 00:39:44.039
You've been with me for years.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.300
You understand me.

00:39:57.952 --> 00:39:59.424
(Daughter)

00:39:59.424 --> 00:40:01.888
(Congrats)

00:40:02.119 --> 00:40:02.840
(Congrats.)
