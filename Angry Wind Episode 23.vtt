00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.200
Nanfeng

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.120
Bad news

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.520
What's wrong?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160
The families of the victims

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.680
have all gathered downstairs.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.760
They're clamoring for compensation.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.520
The investigation isn't clear yet.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.560
The families making a scene won't help.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.320
Then...(Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.080
How about...

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.040
I call the police.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.840
Wait a minute.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.920
With something like this...

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.960
the families being emotional...

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.880
is understandable.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.040
No...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.440
Can we let this situation...

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.920
continue to escalate like this?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.320
Go see the finance department.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.200
Pay whatever needs to be paid.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.320
Alright.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.760
Pay?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
This compensation amount isn't small.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.320
Our company has no cash flow right now.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.520
If we start paying compensation...

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.120
we'll be in a dilemma.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.200
Why not wait until the investigation is clear?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.880
We can wait, but the law won't.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.360
The priority now is to solve the problem.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520
As for the money...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.840
I've made up my mind.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960
Return the internet company to Godfather.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.840
The logistics company...

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.360
Liquidate it.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000
Wait...

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.880
You want to close the company?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.360
This is your life's work.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760
You can't just close it like that.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.360
Zhiyi.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.760
Fate gave me a chance to start over.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.760
It wanted me to live a good life with you.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.680
After all these ups and downs in Haicheng...

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.360
perhaps...

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.160
this is destiny.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.720
It's better to close the company.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.000
Let's go to Shengang together.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.920
And spend the rest of our lives happily.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.920
Okay?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.520
Have you thought it through?

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.960
Are you willing?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.600
As long as it's your decision...

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.640
whatever the choice...

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.120
I'm willing.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760
Why are you crying?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.240
Mr. Cheng.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.000
How is it?

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.600
This one deal of mine is worth ten or a hundred of yours, right?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.400
How did you do it?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.800
I told you.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.680
There's nothing I can't do.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.920
You've expanded so much...

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.800
Aren't you afraid of Customs checking?

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.520
Don't worry.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.920
It's a streamlined operation.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.000
Every link in the chain is unobstructed.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.920
You have sales channels.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.600
Supply falls short of demand.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.200
I promised you.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.600
We'll split it fifty-fifty.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.400
Half for you.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.920
Mr. Xie, you really have connections everywhere.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.840
I've really learned something today.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.920
This is nothing.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.120
There will be even bigger deals in the future.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960
By then, you'll have everything.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.720
Are you still afraid Zhou Zhiyi won't come back?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.600
Let's go, Mr. Cheng.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.600
Let's check the goods over there.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.440
Xiaoli.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.120
Brother Qiang.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.920
I bought some drinks for everyone.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.040
Call everyone over to have some.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.120
Okay.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.400
Brothers, come over here.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.960
Brother Qiang brought drinks for everyone.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.760
Thanks, Brother Qiang.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.680
Xiaoli.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.600
How long have you been at the pier?

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.520
Almost a year.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.960
I transferred from our dance hall...

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.280
over there.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.320
All together, it's been five or six years.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.240
That's indeed quite a long time.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.440
Brother Qiang.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.960
I know why you came to find me.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.560
I didn't dare to say it before.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.560
But if I don't say this...

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.720
I can't live with myself.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.200
Go on.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.920
Last time, Mr. Cheng... from the order...

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.440
removed 10 containers.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.120
I didn't follow the procedure either.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720
I thought doing this...

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600
really didn't fit company regulations.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.640
Why didn't you follow the procedure?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.720
Mr. Cheng said I...

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.440
made a mistake with the warehousing.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.240
And he tore up the original forms.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.680
But I checked repeatedly.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.520
There was no mistake.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.520
Do you know where the removed containers went?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.440
Yes.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.320
Take me there.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.000
Go this way.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.080
It's the innermost warehouse.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.920
Brother Qiang.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.920
You really don't want me to go in with you?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.680
Telling me about this...

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.560
is already good enough.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.960
No need to get dragged in further.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.720
Go back.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.080
Pair of threes, want it?

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080
Pair of twos. Bomb!

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.080
Bomb!

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.120
Want it?

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.480
Yeah, I've already lost.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720
Want it?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.600
Move these away for me.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.520
Brother Qiang.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.800
What are you doing here?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.040
Cheng Yadong.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.000
You dare to smuggle?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.240
Brother Nanfeng won't let you get away with this.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.520
Zheng Nanfeng liquidated the company.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520
He can't do anything to me.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520
Can't do anything to you?

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.920
Come with me to see Brother Nanfeng.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.520
Brother Qiang.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.480
You can't stay here.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.320
Get out of here, now.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.320
Zhao Ziqiang.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.400
Get out of here, listen to me, hurry!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.600
Xie Jiachang.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.600
I never thought you two would collude.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.560
If I had known today...

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.200
Brother Nanfeng shouldn't have let you go back then.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.920
Don't mention Zheng Nanfeng to me.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.920
He's a dead man sooner or later.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.320
Today, I'll send you on your way first.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.120
Then I'll finish off Zheng Nanfeng.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.680
Zhou Zhiyi, Xu Youyou.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.120
None of them will escape.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.680
Forty-nine days.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.600
I'll toy with them to death, one by one.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.720
I'll kill you!

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.440
Boss Zheng, these are all the data and accounts...

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.920
...after our company's liquidation.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.960
Please take a look.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.800
It's fine, I trust your work.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.240
Prioritize settling...

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.080
...the compensation and employee salaries.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.520
Okay.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120
Where is Brother Qiang?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.760
Boss Xie.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.200
Maybe we should lock Brother Qiang up.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.200
Come on.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.520
Boss Cheng.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.720
It's your turn to act.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.920
Boss Xie.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.240
Didn't you eat?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.640
Brother Qiang.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.320
Only the dead...

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.040
...are the safest.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.680
Brother Qiang.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.600
It wasn't me!

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.760
Brother Qiang.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.880
Brother Qiang.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.000
Let's go.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.760
Brother Qiang.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.400
Brother Qiang.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.960
Brother Qiang, wake up.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.120
Brother Qiang.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.480
Xie Jiachang, you jerk!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.520
The cinema next door has a promotion.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.320
Buy one, get one free.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.400
I happen to have two tickets.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.200
I want to give you one.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.120
Are you stupid?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.040
The twenty-sixth.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.040
We've already returned to Haicheng.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.160
Since we came back from investigating the tainted milk powder...

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.640
...I haven't seen him either.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.160
Why don't you try calling him?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.120
Then I'll try.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.200
Can't get through.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:26.960
Boss Cheng.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.520
Where are you planning to go?

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.400
Not planning to go anywhere.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.640
Boss Xie.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.360
Brother Qiang is dead.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.320
Zheng Nanfeng definitely won't let this go.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.920
Sooner or later, he'll find his way here.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.320
Let's go out and lay low for a while.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.120
After things calm down in a bit...

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.120
...we can come back. How about it?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.360
That won't do.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.280
If you run now...

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.760
...it's practically a confession of guilt.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.320
Where can you even escape to?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.320
Thailand.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.240
I'm quite familiar with Thailand.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.600
How can that be?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.440
I haven't killed Zheng Nanfeng yet.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.040
And I haven't had my fun with Zhou Zhiyi.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.720
Boss Xie.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.920
I don't want the shares anymore.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.040
Just let me go.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.720
Ah Jie.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.560
You're so rude.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.520
How dare you get rough with Boss Cheng?

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.200
Come here.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.880
Boss Cheng.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.920
Get Zhou Zhiyi to come here.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.440
What are you going to do to her?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640
What do you think?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.240
If she's tied up...

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.000
...wouldn't Zheng Nanfeng come?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.600
Don't worry.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.880
After it's done...

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.280
...I'll let you both go.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.600
Let you fly away together.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.960
Just say you know Brother Qiang's whereabouts.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.120
She'll definitely come.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.520
Hurry up.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.360
Fine.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.640
Hello?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.680
Zhiyi.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.320
Zhiyi, I've found a lead on the tainted milk powder.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.720
Are you telling the truth?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.560
Zhiyi.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600
You'll know when you get here.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.240
Make sure you come alone.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.720
Where's Cheng Yadong?

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.120
Have him come see me.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.720
Ah Jie.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.400
Zhou Zhiyi.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.120
Long time no see.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.240
Xie Jiachang.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.960
What?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.200
Didn't expect it?

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.920
So you were the one behind everything.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.040
A bit late to realize now, isn't it?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.200
What do you want?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.760
What do I want?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.920
Tie her up.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.920
I miss you.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.840
Whenever dusk arrives.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.720
The evening breeze rises.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.560
Missing you.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.560
Life's mysteries.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.680
Try not to see clearly.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.080
Close your eyes.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.280
Don't respond.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.280
The evening breeze blows and blows.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.960
Go with the wind.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.400
Tonight, child, don't cry in secret.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.560
Don't cry in secret.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.400
The evening breeze blows and blows.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.080
Go with the wind.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.240
With the night's curtain and stars.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.240
Gently fall asleep.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.680
Blowing evening wind.
