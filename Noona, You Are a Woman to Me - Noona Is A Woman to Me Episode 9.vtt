WEBVTT

00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:01.843
(At Yeon House after the Memory Date)

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:05.912
(We had to speak casually.)

00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:09.112
(Mu Jin jokingly addressed me as an older woman a few times, )

00:00:09.113 --> 00:00:12.853
(and I got a reality check.)

00:00:13.423 --> 00:00:16.053
(Noona, your hands are pretty too.)

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:19.192
(If Mu Jin is 11 or 12 years younger than me, )

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:22.463
(I'd wonder if I'd be okay with it.)

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:25.893
(Bon Hee thinks more deeply about the age gap.)

00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:27.502
(Sighing)

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:29.103
(I have so much on my mind.)

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:34.673
(I think today's date was perfect for me.)

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:38.272
(Ye Eun and Ji Won could be compared right away through the dates.)

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:41.613
(I was more comfortable speaking casually to Ye Eun.)

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:44.152
(But the one whom I hit it off well with...)

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:45.412
(was Ji Won, clearly.)

00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:47.159
(I felt more energetic when I was with her.)

00:00:47.183 --> 00:00:49.693
(Sang Won's night is getting complex with many thoughts.)

00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:52.453
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun and Ji Won are out in the living room.)

00:00:53.993 --> 00:00:56.063
(How was your date with Sang Won?)

00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:00.102
(It was fun.)

00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:01.633
(How was your date?)

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:04.132
(I want...)

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.172
(You want to get to know him more?)

00:01:05.173 --> 00:01:06.803
(I want to get to know him better.)

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:13.683
(No longer hiding her feelings for Sang Won)

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:18.213
(In here, Sang Won is the only one I am interested in.)

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:22.792
(And in this situation, Ji Won appeared.)

00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:25.692
(So, from my point of view, )

00:01:25.693 --> 00:01:27.893
(I don't feel all that great, if I'm to be honest.)

00:01:28.193 --> 00:01:30.433
(Knocking)

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.363
(At that moment, Ji Won appears.)

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:35.263
(The conversation dies down as soon as Ji Won enters the room.)

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:37.332
(Clicking her tongue)

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.373
(Sighing)

00:01:40.943 --> 00:01:44.873
(A cold atmosphere lingers among the older women.)

00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:49.952
(The next day, at random, )

00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:54.323
(the group Over or Below Zero Dates are decided.)

00:01:55.823 --> 00:01:57.792
(Are you ice too? Water?)

00:01:57.793 --> 00:01:58.823
(Nodding) Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:01.269
(Ye Eun and Ji Won end up being on the same Team Over Zero.)

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:02.762
(Are you Team Over Zero?)

00:02:02.763 --> 00:02:03.863
(Nodding)

00:02:05.593 --> 00:02:08.332
(Sang Won isn't on the same team as Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:10.273
(Bummed out)

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.173
(How would Team Over Zero’s date go without Sang Won?)

00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:19.482
- Have fun. Bye. - We're off.

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:21.613
- Is it Team Below Zero? - Yes.

00:02:21.943 --> 00:02:24.183
- Let's go. Don't rush. - Off we go.

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:28.752
(Team Below Zero heads to the car.)

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:29.993
Is it that car?

00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:32.153
Get in, everyone.

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:36.463
(Sang Hyeon will drive to the location.)

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:42.162
(So Hyun sits next to Sang Hyeon.)

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:44.432
- Is it roomy in the back? - Yes.

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.172
(Mu Jin and Bon Hee take the back seat.)

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:48.053
- Aren't we too close? - The two are too close.

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:50.872
Sang Won...

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:52.813
(And Director Park.)

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:54.659
- I feel bad for Sang Won. - Isn't that...

00:02:54.683 --> 00:02:56.113
Sang Won is in a tight spot.

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:57.659
- Look at that upset face. - How cute.

00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:58.812
He has that upset face.

00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:00.623
- A "what now?" kind of face. - That's cute.

00:03:00.923 --> 00:03:03.152
It'd be best for Sang Won to appear on Season Two.

00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:04.192
(Laughing)

00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:05.723
Trying again would be better.

00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:07.323
Is there a safety belt?

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:10.492
- It's on the other side. - Put it on.

00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:12.533
(Mu Jin takes care of Bon Hee's safety belt first.)

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:17.803
I'm making direct eye contact with Bon Hee.

00:03:21.273 --> 00:03:23.813
(Laughing)

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:27.912
Sang Hyeon is also in a spot.

00:03:27.913 --> 00:03:29.612
- Things are awkward here. - Yes.

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:31.783
- He's with Bon Hee and So Hyun. - In just one day...

00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:33.423
It must be troubling.

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:36.792
Although not intentional at all,

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:38.793
the members I went with...

00:03:39.423 --> 00:03:42.462
naturally put pressure on me,

00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:46.232
if I'm being honest.

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:49.003
Unknowingly, I got nervous myself.

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:50.972
- Of course. - Totally.

00:03:50.973 --> 00:03:53.442
(There is So Hyun, his current interest, next to him.)

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:55.772
The past interest and the current interest.

00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:57.873
(There is Bon Hee, his past interest, in the back.)

00:03:57.973 --> 00:03:59.883
Last but not least, Director Park.

00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:02.313
And Director Park.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:08.352
(So Hyun, Sang Hyeon, Bon Hee, and Mu Jin...)

00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:11.353
(are in a complicated relationship.)

00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:12.592
(And Sang Won is third-wheeling.)

00:04:12.593 --> 00:04:14.792
(Becoming self-conscious)

00:04:14.793 --> 00:04:16.432
Tell me if you start dozing off.

00:04:16.433 --> 00:04:17.993
- I'll take over right away. - Okay.

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:20.503
- I slept really well last night. - I see.

00:04:20.963 --> 00:04:22.903
Not drinking really helped with that.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.702
- Does everyone know how to skate? - Just a bit.

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:29.942
Only in the past.

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.703
- For real. - It's been ages since I skated.

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:33.643
- Can you skate? - It's not my car.

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:35.512
- I doubt I'll be bad at it. - But I'm used to it.

00:04:35.513 --> 00:04:36.612
I'll hold you.

00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:37.613
(Suddenly)

00:04:37.614 --> 00:04:39.383
Really, what is up with your character?

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:41.783
(Laughing)

00:04:43.093 --> 00:04:45.492
Why not? Even I could hold you.

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:46.593
Yes, of course.

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:49.833
- All souls have left Sang Won. - It's hot in here.

00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.563
I have a feeling everyone can skate at least a bit.

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:57.532
Are you bad at it?

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:59.202
I'm not good at it, nor am I bad at it.

00:04:59.203 --> 00:05:01.302
- I used to roller-blade. - Same here.

00:05:01.303 --> 00:05:02.802
- Like in-line skate. - Yes.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.843
I've been on ones with four wheels.

00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:06.943
Wait, you skated on a four-wheeled?

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:08.442
- No, the straight one. - There were roller rinks.

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:09.612
No, the one she's talking about.

00:05:09.613 --> 00:05:11.012
I think she's talking about roller skates.

00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:12.252
- Roller skates. - There were roller skates.

00:05:12.253 --> 00:05:13.623
I can feel your age.

00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:16.392
(He's unstoppable.)

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:19.453
- Sang Won has warmed up now. - What's wrong with him?

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:21.962
Have you not roller skated before?

00:05:21.963 --> 00:05:23.692
- Roller rinks... - Roller rinks...

00:05:23.693 --> 00:05:25.533
- I'm not sure. - It wasn't in our generation.

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:28.432
The roller rinks were outside on top of department stores.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.533
- Yes, on rooftops. - Exactly.

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:33.503
Is it similar to a modern indoor play place for kids?

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:34.743
No way.

00:05:34.744 --> 00:05:36.673
It was for adults.

00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:38.272
Only the older women would know.

00:05:38.273 --> 00:05:41.582
I remember rollerblades were released a while after that.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.082
- Sorry? - Rollerblades were released...

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:44.753
a while after that.

00:05:46.053 --> 00:05:48.122
You mean rollerblades?

00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:49.522
- The straight ones? - Rollerblades?

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.652
The straight ones. It wasn't a while after, but just a few years.

00:05:51.653 --> 00:05:53.692
We were able to buy them, but only after then.

00:05:53.693 --> 00:05:54.793
- Is that so? - Yes.

00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:57.433
You do know roller rinks, right?

00:05:57.963 --> 00:05:59.432
I've never heard of them.

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.202
- Have you not seen any in movies? - Come on.

00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:02.962
- No, I swear. - No way.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:06.132
Roller rinks appear in many music videos and movies.

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.202
- Roller... - Exactly.

00:06:07.203 --> 00:06:08.342
(Thinking)

00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:11.543
- A movie with an 1980s background. - Yes.

00:06:11.773 --> 00:06:13.982
- You go around in big circles. - Yes, constantly.

00:06:13.983 --> 00:06:15.843
It looks like a skating rink.

00:06:16.143 --> 00:06:17.682
(The Gen Z is dumbfounded.)

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:19.082
- Is it a place... - I roller skated.

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:20.482
Where you can roller skate?

00:06:20.483 --> 00:06:21.523
Only roller skating.

00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:24.022
- Let's continue with the shoot. - What are some movies?

00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:25.423
(Gave up on explaining)

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.892
Out of the blue, Se7en debuted.

00:06:27.893 --> 00:06:29.893
- What's Se7en? - I think.

00:06:30.263 --> 00:06:31.693
What's Se7en?

00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:34.202
- Se7en. - Se7en wore roller skates...

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:35.443
for the song "Come Back to Me."

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:38.133
Hold on.

00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:41.342
- Hold on. - You mean the singer Se7en?

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:42.442
- I know him. - I know Se7en.

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:44.003
- Of course. - At first, I didn't know.

00:06:44.313 --> 00:06:46.012
The three take forever to understand.

00:06:46.013 --> 00:06:47.612
- Like forever. - Right?

00:06:47.613 --> 00:06:49.912
Everyone in our generation knew "Come Back to Me" by Se7en.

00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:51.582
He rolled in with those pair of shoes...

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:52.583
- and danced. - Come back to me

00:06:52.584 --> 00:06:53.622
The shoes with wheels, right?

00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:55.552
- Yes. - We rode those too.

00:06:55.553 --> 00:06:56.922
(Inhaling)

00:06:56.923 --> 00:06:58.222
(Thinking)

00:06:58.223 --> 00:06:59.263
Aren't those old memories?

00:06:59.493 --> 00:07:00.493
(Laughing)
Yes, old memories.

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:04.493
I suddenly feel the need to talk formally.

00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.763
I guess they can finally feel the age gap.

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:10.303
I'm curious.

00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:12.872
Everyone has different standards and thoughts about...

00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:14.143
long-distance relationships.

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:17.842
I think it’s a long-distance relationship if I can’t see...

00:07:17.843 --> 00:07:19.963
my partner when I want, which makes me feel burdened.

00:07:20.383 --> 00:07:22.442
Like if I can't see my partner after work.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:24.243
That feels like a long-distance relationship.

00:07:24.383 --> 00:07:27.022
It's one of the factors that may make...

00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:28.423
keeping a relationship hard for me.

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:30.193
What do you guys think?

00:07:30.653 --> 00:07:32.252
(Thinking)

00:07:32.253 --> 00:07:33.593
That's an important matter.

00:07:35.323 --> 00:07:40.562
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin think about the realistic problem.)

00:07:40.563 --> 00:07:41.683
Long-distance relationships.

00:07:43.273 --> 00:07:44.772
(Curious)

00:07:44.773 --> 00:07:46.873
I've never had a long-distance relationship.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.873
But here's what made me fight with my past partners.

00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:55.213
We tried to see each other too often,

00:07:55.243 --> 00:07:58.113
like 4 to 5 times a week.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.753
That was tough.

00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:03.853
I'm someone who needs...

00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:05.893
a certain amount of personal time.

00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:09.492
I'd rather see each other 1 or 2 times a week.

00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:10.632
(Mu Jin thinks there are pros to it.)

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:12.893
It'd be nice to see your partner when you miss them.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.873
What if you miss her every day?

00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:19.433
We can video call each other.

00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:22.302
We can do that even if it's long-distance.

00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:23.972
- True. - If it's long distance.

00:08:23.973 --> 00:08:25.073
You're right.

00:08:25.173 --> 00:08:27.712
It's a hard question. I've never had one before.

00:08:27.713 --> 00:08:28.912
It's far from easy.

00:08:28.913 --> 00:08:30.752
- Holding back when you miss them. - I don't have much experience.

00:08:30.753 --> 00:08:32.182
- If you miss them... - That will make you miss them more,

00:08:32.183 --> 00:08:34.283
- Exactly. - like how people used to date.

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:38.653
The bus or train ride could be heart-fluttering.

00:08:39.223 --> 00:08:41.163
- It's heartrending. - True.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.093
Long-distance relationships...

00:08:44.163 --> 00:08:45.962
What do you think? Have you been in one?

00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:47.162
While I was modeling...

00:08:47.163 --> 00:08:48.402
- back in the US, - Yes?

00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.703
I had a long-distance relationship...

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:53.603
for about four years with a boyfriend who was in Korea.

00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:54.803
(4 years?)
- How... - That's really...

00:08:55.804 --> 00:08:57.712
You heard what Mu Jin just said.

00:08:57.713 --> 00:08:59.842
I don't like going on a date every day either.

00:08:59.843 --> 00:09:00.943
What do you think?

00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:02.903
- About meeting every day. - That's...

00:09:03.483 --> 00:09:05.383
Twice a month is more than enough.

00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:06.783
Twice a month?

00:09:07.053 --> 00:09:09.183
(In disbelief)

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:11.193
Wait, is that even considered dating?

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:12.792
- I... - I prefer meeting every day.

00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:14.022
I like meeting all the time.

00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:15.362
Either way,

00:09:15.363 --> 00:09:18.462
the heart-fluttering emotions die down someday.

00:09:18.463 --> 00:09:21.462
You need to get to know constantly and decide whether...

00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:23.702
- to break up or keep dating. - Like I mentioned earlier...

00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:24.902
Say that SOOBIN is in...

00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:26.072
- a long-distance relationship. - Okay.

00:09:26.073 --> 00:09:27.873
How far will it be okay for you?

00:09:28.043 --> 00:09:32.442
If it's not from Seoul to Daegu or Busan...

00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:33.612
Are you fine within Seoul?

00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:35.282
- Seoul is fine. - Even the Greater Seoul Area?

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.312
- Yes. - The greater Seoul Area?

00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:38.252
- I think so. - These days,

00:09:38.253 --> 00:09:40.222
traffic is insane.

00:09:40.223 --> 00:09:42.953
The way back home after dropping her off is so lonely.

00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:45.422
- True. - It's so lonely.

00:09:45.423 --> 00:09:46.492
It gets tough.

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:48.563
If it's too far away, let her sleep at your place.

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:52.333
SOOBIN, please date someone like her.

00:09:52.963 --> 00:09:55.244
- Someone who lets you stay over. - If it's too far away.

00:09:56.603 --> 00:09:57.702
- Hi. - Hi.

00:09:57.703 --> 00:09:58.902
- Is that a roller rink? - Yes.

00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:00.143
Where are they?

00:10:00.673 --> 00:10:02.842
(Team Below Zero's Date Course: Ice Rink)

00:10:02.843 --> 00:10:04.643
It's ice skating.

00:10:05.643 --> 00:10:07.812
- Hence Team Below Zero. - Yes.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:09.812
- It's cold in here. - It's freezing cold.

00:10:09.813 --> 00:10:11.182
- It's cold. - Yes, it's cold.

00:10:11.183 --> 00:10:13.143
- It's actually really cold. - Why is it so cold?

00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:14.353
Oh, dear.

00:10:14.983 --> 00:10:16.623
- It's cold. - It's cold.

00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:21.423
- My foot size? - My foot size is...

00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:24.263
- What's your size, So Hyun? - Between 245mm and 250mm.

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:30.402
(Bon Hee has a hard time putting on the skates.)

00:10:30.403 --> 00:10:32.933
(Hitting)

00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:35.942
(Staring)

00:10:35.943 --> 00:10:38.473
- Can you do it? - No, I can't.

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:40.313
- Is it tight? - Yes.

00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:42.083
Okay.

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:44.483
If you're not careful,

00:10:45.383 --> 00:10:47.423
- your ankles will hurt. - It does hurt.

00:10:48.153 --> 00:10:49.483
- Does it feel okay? - Yes.

00:10:51.523 --> 00:10:53.153
(Glancing)

00:10:53.693 --> 00:10:56.013
Is this the right way? Are we supposed to wear them small?

00:10:56.293 --> 00:10:57.493
I don't think so.

00:10:57.593 --> 00:10:59.263
They're very firm.

00:11:00.063 --> 00:11:01.963
- They're so tight. - So are mine.

00:11:03.933 --> 00:11:07.443
(Lovey-dovey and dealing with their own skates)

00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:09.772
(What kind of date will they go on?)

00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:10.913
Shall we go and skate?

00:11:11.013 --> 00:11:12.013
Shall we?

00:11:12.014 --> 00:11:13.543
(Amazed)

00:11:14.513 --> 00:11:15.742
All right.

00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:17.452
- It's so slippery. - It's slippery, right?

00:11:17.453 --> 00:11:19.413
- Hold on. - It's very slippery.

00:11:19.513 --> 00:11:21.623
(Holding on)

00:11:22.423 --> 00:11:24.693
This is so wrong.

00:11:24.993 --> 00:11:26.593
Stay on the wall, and go slowly.

00:11:27.863 --> 00:11:28.892
It feels weird.

00:11:28.893 --> 00:11:30.133
(Stumbling)

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:32.062
(They take their first steps one at a time.)

00:11:32.063 --> 00:11:33.162
Oh, no.

00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:35.003
(They take their first steps one at a time.)

00:11:36.003 --> 00:11:37.103
This is no joke.

00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.902
I think I can go if I go slowly.

00:11:40.903 --> 00:11:41.973
Can you?

00:11:43.543 --> 00:11:45.172
Bon Hee is afraid.

00:11:45.173 --> 00:11:46.643
- She's afraid. - She is.

00:11:48.343 --> 00:11:49.483
Are you all right?

00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:52.653
Yes, I can skate,

00:11:53.013 --> 00:11:55.583
but it's slipperier than I thought.

00:11:55.683 --> 00:11:57.753
- It's... - This is so hard.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.393
It's not that easy.

00:12:00.793 --> 00:12:03.262
(There are sleds at the center.)

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:05.193
Oh, these are for those who are scared.

00:12:06.063 --> 00:12:07.332
- Take a seat. - Okay.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:09.063
- I'll push you hard. - Okay.

00:12:10.373 --> 00:12:11.433
Let's go.

00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:13.903
You're so fast!

00:12:17.413 --> 00:12:21.012
(A major accident)

00:12:21.013 --> 00:12:22.083
- Or not. - No!

00:12:22.613 --> 00:12:24.153
- I was so startled. - Sang Won!

00:12:25.613 --> 00:12:26.823
Are you crazy?

00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:28.982
- I'm sorry. - I'm okay.

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:30.223
- Are you okay? - Are you hurt?

00:12:30.523 --> 00:12:31.793
(Getting up)

00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:34.592
(Mu Jin rushes toward her.)

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:35.822
- Bon Hee, are you all right? - I'm okay.

00:12:35.823 --> 00:12:36.892
He came running.

00:12:36.893 --> 00:12:39.092
I thought it'd stop,

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:40.102
- but it kept going. - Really?

00:12:40.103 --> 00:12:41.732
- I'm fine. - It drifted instead. Are you okay?

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:43.432
- Yes, I'm okay. - Are you sure?

00:12:43.433 --> 00:12:45.333
It didn't turn smoothly.

00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:47.042
- I thought it'd turn with me. - Did you do that on purpose?

00:12:47.043 --> 00:12:48.602
No, I didn't. I thought it'd stop.

00:12:48.603 --> 00:12:50.972
- I'm joking. - But it didn't.

00:12:50.973 --> 00:12:52.043
How did you fall?

00:12:52.143 --> 00:12:54.943
I opened my eyes, and I was on the ground.

00:12:55.383 --> 00:12:57.012
(Finding her cute)

00:12:57.013 --> 00:12:59.153
I feel like I'll fall again.

00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:00.783
I'll hold your hand.

00:13:02.383 --> 00:13:03.453
I'll hold your hand.

00:13:04.153 --> 00:13:06.223
- Gosh. - They refuse to be separated now.

00:13:06.493 --> 00:13:09.863
Another guy tripped her, so...

00:13:10.593 --> 00:13:12.092
He's going to stick with her.

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:14.132
It's harder than I thought...

00:13:14.133 --> 00:13:15.462
- because it's been a while. - Same.

00:13:15.463 --> 00:13:17.102
But I think I'm doing better than I expected.

00:13:17.103 --> 00:13:18.433
- You are. - Yes.

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:19.703
Didn't you get hurt?

00:13:22.103 --> 00:13:23.872
My head hurts a little, but it's okay.

00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:24.942
Your head hurts?

00:13:24.943 --> 00:13:26.512
It wasn't a hard hit.

00:13:26.513 --> 00:13:30.082
(The two are on a private date...)

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:31.683
(Looking)

00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:35.082
Mu Jin is so sweet.

00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:38.123
- He is. - What's Sang Hyeon doing?

00:13:38.793 --> 00:13:40.292
(He's playing by himself from a distance.)

00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:42.093
He's having fun all by himself.

00:13:43.363 --> 00:13:45.393
Come on, it's a date.

00:13:46.163 --> 00:13:47.233
This is fun.

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:50.132
- What's he doing here? - Why...

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:52.073
Oh, my goodness. Why doesn't he look after her?

00:13:55.273 --> 00:13:58.173
(Sang Hyeon has no clue and just enjoys skating.)

00:13:58.813 --> 00:14:01.219
From the way we're spending time, don't we look like people...

00:14:01.243 --> 00:14:03.042
who have never dated anyone before?

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.312
Sorry, did I make you seem that way?

00:14:04.313 --> 00:14:05.612
No, it's not you.

00:14:05.613 --> 00:14:08.082
- Okay. - I meant the boys.

00:14:08.083 --> 00:14:09.183
(Sighing)

00:14:09.953 --> 00:14:12.023
- No! - What?

00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:18.533
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:20.803
Are you all right?

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:23.302
You ran right into it.

00:14:23.303 --> 00:14:24.303
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:26.503
This is going to bruise up.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:27.773
Seriously.

00:14:29.273 --> 00:14:30.542
(But Sang Hyeon can't seem to go near her.)

00:14:30.543 --> 00:14:31.743
Why doesn't he approach her?

00:14:32.473 --> 00:14:33.743
Right.

00:14:35.113 --> 00:14:38.183
I kept picking Sang Hyeon,

00:14:38.383 --> 00:14:41.183
and I wished he would...

00:14:42.553 --> 00:14:45.952
look like he wanted to have fun with me.

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:46.993
I know.

00:14:47.593 --> 00:14:50.123
But I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

00:14:50.233 --> 00:14:51.563
It's natural.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:55.933
(Slipping)

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:58.232
(Skating away)

00:14:58.233 --> 00:14:59.973
(So Hyun almost fell.)

00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:02.143
Why doesn't he hold her?

00:15:04.713 --> 00:15:06.213
I knew that would happen.

00:15:06.943 --> 00:15:08.712
- Be careful. - I can't brake.

00:15:08.713 --> 00:15:10.553
- You can't. - I can't brake.

00:15:14.653 --> 00:15:17.792
He could at least talk to her.

00:15:17.793 --> 00:15:18.793
(So Hyun's face hardened at his indifference.)

00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:21.022
- He's not even trying. - Exactly.

00:15:21.023 --> 00:15:22.492
(What exactly is on his mind?)

00:15:22.493 --> 00:15:23.833
I wonder why he does that.

00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:27.062
How is he so indifferent?

00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:29.703
Because there's Bon Hee.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:31.033
I guess so.

00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:33.003
Say I fell.

00:15:33.173 --> 00:15:36.273
Sang Hyeon, who I'm interested in, doesn't even come to me,

00:15:36.373 --> 00:15:38.473
and Mu Jin comes to help me up...

00:15:38.573 --> 00:15:40.483
and asks me how I am.

00:15:40.713 --> 00:15:43.512
My first thought will be, "I'm jealous of Bon Hee."

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:44.513
(Jealous of Bon Hee)

00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:46.283
I'll be so jealous of her.

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:48.483
Then, I'll resent Sang Hyeon.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.823
And Mu Jin will start to look different.

00:15:52.353 --> 00:15:54.663
Compared to Sang Hyeon.

00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:56.263
He's never too much.

00:15:56.363 --> 00:15:57.632
- That's true. - Right?

00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:59.062
Even when he asks...

00:15:59.063 --> 00:16:01.263
if she eats or how she feels...

00:16:01.363 --> 00:16:02.633
"Did you eat?"

00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:05.703
Was that an impression of Mu Jin?

00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:08.473
Something goes forward when I do his impression.

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:09.672
What is it?

00:16:09.673 --> 00:16:11.873
I don't know. It could be my jaw or anything else.

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.112
(I look just like him, don't I?)

00:16:14.113 --> 00:16:16.242
- What is that? - "My jaw or anything else."

00:16:16.243 --> 00:16:17.382
Mu Jin kind of does this.

00:16:17.383 --> 00:16:18.753
"Did you eat?"

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:21.223
- What is that? - He does.

00:16:21.853 --> 00:16:23.523
(Swaying)

00:16:23.723 --> 00:16:24.753
"Did you eat?"

00:16:25.353 --> 00:16:27.062
- What is that? - He does.

00:16:27.063 --> 00:16:29.493
- When did he do that? - I don't know, but he does it.

00:16:29.963 --> 00:16:31.232
- What are you talking about? - Like this.

00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:32.233
(Sitting like Mu Jin)

00:16:32.234 --> 00:16:33.333
He does this.

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:35.333
That's bizarre.

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:37.633
Let's have a contest.

00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:39.673
The loser buys coffee?

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:41.802
Or we can play rock-paper-scissors...

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:43.973
to pick members for a contest,

00:16:44.343 --> 00:16:45.712
and the losing team buys coffee.

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.382
- That sounds better. - As a team?

00:16:47.383 --> 00:16:49.043
- Yes. - Okay, then.

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:50.812
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

00:16:50.813 --> 00:16:51.913
(So Hyun wins.)

00:16:52.253 --> 00:16:53.253
I'll pick...

00:16:54.123 --> 00:16:55.683
She should pick Sang Hyeon.

00:16:56.953 --> 00:16:57.953
(She'll pick Sang Hyeon, right?)

00:16:57.954 --> 00:17:00.862
I'll pick Mu Jin.

00:17:00.863 --> 00:17:01.993
- What? - What?

00:17:02.093 --> 00:17:03.492
Mu Jin.

00:17:03.493 --> 00:17:04.962
(Oh, no)

00:17:04.963 --> 00:17:06.883
- He is a good skater. - You saw it, didn't you?

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:09.133
What's going on?

00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.402
Maybe she feels uncomfortable...

00:17:11.403 --> 00:17:13.003
because Sang Hyeon isn't talking to her.

00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:15.502
Then, I'll pick Sang Hyeon.

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:16.503
What?

00:17:17.313 --> 00:17:18.313
All right.

00:17:18.373 --> 00:17:20.112
- Okay. - All right.

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:21.283
I'll be the judge, then.

00:17:21.713 --> 00:17:23.443
- In a straight line? - Yes, in a line.

00:17:25.283 --> 00:17:27.683
- Are you ready? - I was born ready.

00:17:27.783 --> 00:17:29.783
(Laughing)

00:17:30.653 --> 00:17:33.293
I have a question. So, it's one lap, right?

00:17:33.393 --> 00:17:35.593
- No, we go straight. - No, straight.

00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:37.503
It ends if you both pass the finish line.

00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:39.393
It ends if we both pass the finish line.

00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:40.813
(Hesitant and looking away)

00:17:40.963 --> 00:17:43.532
- I have no choice but to hold you. - Yes, I'll hold it.

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:45.102
- I'll hold your arm. - Okay. Good.

00:17:45.103 --> 00:17:46.972
- It should be the other way around. - Like this?

00:17:46.973 --> 00:17:48.472
Grab my wrist.

00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:49.473
- Grab it. - I've never seen them...
touch each other before.

00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.273
(Shy)

00:17:54.883 --> 00:17:57.112
(Mu Jin and So Hyun also hold hands.)

00:17:57.113 --> 00:17:58.812
- I'll drag you there if I have to. - What?

00:17:58.813 --> 00:18:00.259
I'm going to drag you there if I have to.

00:18:00.283 --> 00:18:01.652
We have good teamwork, though.

00:18:01.653 --> 00:18:02.783
- Right? - Yes.

00:18:04.423 --> 00:18:05.692
Did you notice that?

00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:07.023
(Laughing)

00:18:07.863 --> 00:18:08.863
Everybody ready?

00:18:09.793 --> 00:18:11.563
Let's start. Get ready.

00:18:12.093 --> 00:18:13.532
Get set. Go.

00:18:13.533 --> 00:18:15.111
(The coffee bet begins.)

00:18:15.418 --> 00:18:16.383
Get set. Go.

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:18.613
(The coffee bet begins.)

00:18:22.953 --> 00:18:24.123
I'll use both my hands.

00:18:25.023 --> 00:18:27.193
(So Hyun and Mu Jin zip by.)

00:18:27.223 --> 00:18:30.723
Left foot, right foot.

00:18:30.724 --> 00:18:33.433
- It's a piece of cake! - Okay.

00:18:35.433 --> 00:18:36.832
(An easy win for So Hyun and Mu Jin)

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:38.803
Thanks for the coffee, guys!

00:18:40.003 --> 00:18:41.633
Oh, come on.

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:43.473
We're both bad at this.

00:18:43.573 --> 00:18:44.603
Be careful.

00:18:44.803 --> 00:18:46.272
- Let's go. - Thanks for the coffee.

00:18:46.273 --> 00:18:48.642
Coffee's on us. That's not hard.

00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:49.913
(Flinching)

00:18:51.313 --> 00:18:53.313
We had good teamwork.

00:18:53.513 --> 00:18:56.323
Yes. I noticed it when we talked yesterday.

00:19:01.493 --> 00:19:04.263
(The Below Zero Date ends.)

00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:06.523
- Should I just drive? - I'll drive. It's totally fine.

00:19:10.933 --> 00:19:13.373
(Mu Jin will drive on the way back.)

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:14.732
Are you sure you'll be fine in the middle seat?

00:19:14.733 --> 00:19:15.833
I'm okay.

00:19:16.473 --> 00:19:17.772
It's the toughest seat.

00:19:17.773 --> 00:19:19.102
Why didn't she sit next to him?

00:19:19.103 --> 00:19:20.172
Why didn't she?

00:19:20.173 --> 00:19:22.683
(So Hyun already sat in the shotgun seat.)

00:19:24.813 --> 00:19:25.813
It's cool.

00:19:26.753 --> 00:19:30.782
(Team Below Zero heads to the Yeon House.)

00:19:30.783 --> 00:19:32.323
This looks weird.

00:19:37.663 --> 00:19:40.663
Why don't we...

00:19:41.393 --> 00:19:44.762
share our favorite memory...

00:19:44.763 --> 00:19:46.103
from our time here?

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:47.372
Until now?

00:19:47.373 --> 00:19:50.143
Yes, the most memorable thing until now.

00:19:50.973 --> 00:19:54.613
You've been here two days longer than I have, after all.

00:19:56.543 --> 00:19:58.443
(Thinking)

00:19:58.943 --> 00:19:59.952
(Pondering)

00:19:59.953 --> 00:20:01.213
The most memorable?

00:20:01.883 --> 00:20:03.483
They can't answer?

00:20:04.723 --> 00:20:06.293
Was that a difficult question?

00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:10.493
Maybe we're all thinking of one,

00:20:11.963 --> 00:20:14.763
but we don't always say it out loud.

00:20:16.163 --> 00:20:19.003
Is it related to Bon Hee?

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:21.233
I see.

00:20:21.234 --> 00:20:24.173
Perhaps it's about Bon Hee.

00:20:24.503 --> 00:20:25.602
Maybe.

00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:26.672
(Reading her face)

00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:28.142
(So Hyun's face stiffens at his answer.)

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.243
So Hyun's face hardened.

00:20:30.613 --> 00:20:32.182
(Frustrated)

00:20:32.183 --> 00:20:33.983
So Hyun is about to cry.

00:20:35.213 --> 00:20:36.783
(Feeling awkward)

00:20:40.623 --> 00:20:43.563
(What's on Sang Hyeon's mind?)

00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:45.262
(It went silent in the car.)

00:20:45.263 --> 00:20:46.563
This is suffocating.

00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:48.292
It's so suffocating in the car.

00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:49.333
Right.

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:53.902
You know the hot vacation spots in Southeast Asia?

00:20:53.903 --> 00:20:55.102
Have you been abroad often?

00:20:55.103 --> 00:20:58.943
I've been to Bangkok, Pataya, and Bali.

00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:00.943
- I'm jealous. - Jealous of what?

00:21:01.073 --> 00:21:02.912
I also want to go abroad a lot.

00:21:02.913 --> 00:21:04.013
Do you?

00:21:04.283 --> 00:21:05.912
I've already done a lot of domestic traveling.

00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:07.883
Really? What was your favorite place?

00:21:08.683 --> 00:21:09.822
Tongyeong.

00:21:09.823 --> 00:21:12.183
My great-aunt lives there.

00:21:12.453 --> 00:21:14.193
My great-aunt lives in Tongyeong.

00:21:14.353 --> 00:21:15.793
She runs a restaurant there.

00:21:16.563 --> 00:21:18.423
- What kind of restaurant? - Beef-bone soup.

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:20.462
It's so tasty.

00:21:20.463 --> 00:21:21.463
(No way!)

00:21:21.464 --> 00:21:23.602
Beef-bone soup made by your great-aunt?

00:21:23.603 --> 00:21:27.603
(She feels much better after talking to Mu Jin.)

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.803
(Peeking)

00:21:31.173 --> 00:21:32.442
Does anyone...

00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:34.943
want to stop by the convenience store?

00:21:35.143 --> 00:21:37.342
- Anyone? - I won't mind stopping by.

00:21:37.343 --> 00:21:38.343
Me neither.

00:21:39.243 --> 00:21:41.682
(Team Below Zero stops by the convenience store...)

00:21:41.683 --> 00:21:43.422
(near the Yeon House.)

00:21:43.423 --> 00:21:45.353
(She just woke up.)

00:21:46.723 --> 00:21:48.623
We're stopping by the convenience store.

00:21:49.053 --> 00:21:51.163
- Sleep. You can stay here. - Okay.

00:21:52.193 --> 00:21:53.363
Let's go.

00:21:59.473 --> 00:22:01.402
(Sang Hyeon stretches.)

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.202
Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee are left alone.

00:22:03.203 --> 00:22:05.943
(And Bon Hee keeps her eyes closed.)

00:22:07.543 --> 00:22:09.783
The day feels like a dream.

00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:12.013
It does.

00:22:14.353 --> 00:22:15.453
Oh, my.

00:22:16.083 --> 00:22:17.182
I really...

00:22:17.183 --> 00:22:19.792
(Hesitating)

00:22:19.793 --> 00:22:22.052
I really don't know what I'm doing.

00:22:22.053 --> 00:22:24.322
(I really don't know what I'm doing.)

00:22:24.323 --> 00:22:26.763
- Right now? - Whatever it is.

00:22:29.663 --> 00:22:32.463
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around you.

00:22:32.903 --> 00:22:35.173
I hope you don't.

00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:36.342
I don't want to,

00:22:36.343 --> 00:22:38.642
and I'm trying not to.

00:22:38.643 --> 00:22:40.112
But I can't help it.

00:22:40.113 --> 00:22:42.273
And I walk on eggshells around So Hyun as well.

00:22:45.413 --> 00:22:48.113
I think I'm getting to know myself.

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:52.123
In a good way or a bad way.

00:22:55.153 --> 00:22:56.422
(Sighing)

00:22:56.423 --> 00:22:58.593
You must be feeling lots of emotions right now.

00:22:58.693 --> 00:23:01.132
I feel like I'm filming my period of growth,

00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:02.633
and it's driving me insane.

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:05.903
(Sighing)

00:23:06.373 --> 00:23:09.203
You're the only one who knows yourself best.

00:23:09.803 --> 00:23:11.603
I don't know myself that well.

00:23:13.143 --> 00:23:15.243
I'm just too slow.

00:23:15.473 --> 00:23:17.342
I'm slow and conscious.

00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:19.313
I'm too slow.

00:23:20.783 --> 00:23:23.023
But I have to be fast when I'm here.

00:23:25.053 --> 00:23:27.093
It weighs heavily on me if I overthink it,

00:23:28.353 --> 00:23:29.593
so I try...

00:23:29.993 --> 00:23:33.963
to keep myself relaxed for my sake.

00:23:36.703 --> 00:23:38.502
(Sang Hyeon struggles...)

00:23:38.503 --> 00:23:40.572
(with the pace and direction of his decisions.)

00:23:40.573 --> 00:23:42.472
As we expected,

00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:45.102
Sang Hyeon's awkward behavior was...

00:23:45.103 --> 00:23:47.272
because he was conscious...

00:23:47.273 --> 00:23:48.742
- of Bon Hee. - Yes.

00:23:48.743 --> 00:23:50.382
- And of So Hyun. - Yes.

00:23:50.383 --> 00:23:52.343
One of them is the girl that he liked,

00:23:52.643 --> 00:23:55.183
and the other is the girl who likes him.

00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:57.022
Whichever it is,

00:23:57.023 --> 00:23:59.352
he should be more considerate of the person who's into him...

00:23:59.353 --> 00:24:02.323
and keep an open mind by approaching her too.

00:24:02.453 --> 00:24:04.892
Even if Bon Hee is with Mu Jin,

00:24:04.893 --> 00:24:06.092
as Mu Jin said,

00:24:06.093 --> 00:24:07.592
he's only doing what his heart tells him to do.

00:24:07.593 --> 00:24:08.832
- He told her not to... - Right.

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:10.302
Be too conscious of him.

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:11.532
The courage...

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:15.173
to approach both sides.

00:24:15.673 --> 00:24:17.702
That's what Sang Hyeon needs at the moment.

00:24:17.703 --> 00:24:19.942
I hope he realizes it...

00:24:19.943 --> 00:24:21.772
before he loses everything that matters.

00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:22.913
Right.

00:24:24.183 --> 00:24:26.142
(Yeong Gyeong, Ye Eun, Ji Won, Ji Yung, and Hyeon Jun...)

00:24:26.143 --> 00:24:27.223
(go on the Over Zero Date.)

00:24:27.913 --> 00:24:29.453
I'll drive safely.

00:24:33.093 --> 00:24:35.893
(Silent)

00:24:37.163 --> 00:24:38.792
Oh, no. It's suffocating.

00:24:38.793 --> 00:24:41.393
(Feeling uncomfortable)

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:43.863
- Oh, my gosh. - That's wild.

00:24:44.433 --> 00:24:46.163
- Oh, boy. - These older women are...

00:24:46.873 --> 00:24:49.173
(Last night)

00:24:49.543 --> 00:24:52.303
(How was date with Sang Won??)

00:24:53.873 --> 00:24:55.012
(I want...)

00:24:55.013 --> 00:24:56.212
(You want to get to know him more?)

00:24:56.213 --> 00:24:58.443
(I want to get to know him better.)

00:24:59.413 --> 00:25:02.312
(You don't care...)

00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:03.322
(for Ji Yung, right?)

00:25:03.323 --> 00:25:04.653
(Nodding)

00:25:06.623 --> 00:25:08.793
(So it's Sang Won.)

00:25:09.493 --> 00:25:11.523
(Nodding)

00:25:11.963 --> 00:25:13.992
(Ye Eun and Ji Won, who were both interested in Sang Won, )

00:25:13.993 --> 00:25:15.433
(had an uncomfortable conversation.)

00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:20.432
What should Yeong Gyeong do?

00:25:20.433 --> 00:25:22.303
It's making her uncomfortable as well.

00:25:22.973 --> 00:25:25.273
Yeong Gyeong said she used to go jet skiing a lot.

00:25:26.003 --> 00:25:27.513
- Really? - At the Han River?

00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:30.082
Wherever.

00:25:30.083 --> 00:25:32.282
- I mostly went to the ocean. - Oh, the ocean.

00:25:32.283 --> 00:25:33.853
I also love jet skiing.

00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:37.882
You can ride a jet ski without getting water on your face.

00:25:37.883 --> 00:25:39.022
- That's true. - Seriously?

00:25:39.023 --> 00:25:40.653
- It's a water motorcycle. - Yes.

00:25:41.253 --> 00:25:42.852
You're not going into the water.

00:25:42.853 --> 00:25:44.463
- Right. - Oh, really?

00:25:44.993 --> 00:25:47.193
I'm speaking fast today, aren't I?

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:49.432
- Totally. - I'm trying really hard.

00:25:49.433 --> 00:25:50.703
You're so funny.

00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:52.202
- I've changed. - She's so cute.

00:25:52.203 --> 00:25:54.402
How do you normally speak?

00:25:54.403 --> 00:25:56.272
- Normally... - I'm usually slow.

00:25:56.273 --> 00:25:58.402
But everyone pointed out how slowly I spoke,

00:25:58.403 --> 00:26:00.142
so I'm speaking three times faster than usual.

00:26:00.143 --> 00:26:02.512
- As if I'm rapping. - She's so cute.

00:26:02.513 --> 00:26:04.212
That was really fast just now.

00:26:04.213 --> 00:26:06.243
Was it? I'm trying.

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:10.123
- She's so charming. - She's very attractive.

00:26:10.253 --> 00:26:12.453
- It's cute that she's trying. - Indeed.

00:26:13.053 --> 00:26:14.253
We're here.

00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:17.592
(Team Over Zero's dating spot for water sports)

00:26:17.593 --> 00:26:18.593
It must be so fun.

00:26:18.594 --> 00:26:20.133
I'll put all of you in the water.

00:26:20.863 --> 00:26:22.063
The sun is so hot.

00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:25.233
(Ji Won and Ye Eun got changed first.)

00:26:26.163 --> 00:26:28.672
- They're... - Oh, boy.

00:26:28.673 --> 00:26:30.143
(Awkward)

00:26:30.703 --> 00:26:33.173
(Looking around for no reason)

00:26:36.443 --> 00:26:38.882
(Ji Yung and Hyeon Jun are also ready.)

00:26:38.883 --> 00:26:40.153
It should be fun.

00:26:41.253 --> 00:26:42.712
You're here.

00:26:42.713 --> 00:26:45.022
Why are your bathing suits so fabulous?

00:26:45.023 --> 00:26:46.323
They're fabulous?

00:26:47.493 --> 00:26:48.693
Who wants to try wakeboarding?

00:26:48.793 --> 00:26:51.123
Me. It looks fun.

00:26:51.593 --> 00:26:53.263
Isn't that too tricky?

00:26:53.563 --> 00:26:54.962
It's so tricky.

00:26:54.963 --> 00:26:56.332
I bet Ji Yung is good.

00:26:56.333 --> 00:26:58.503
- Let's go! - Let's go!

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:01.573
Here we go.

00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:06.973
(Ji Yung stands up instantly.)

00:27:08.873 --> 00:27:10.412
Right away?

00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:12.282
Don't you have to be at a high level...

00:27:12.283 --> 00:27:13.653
to stand up instantly?

00:27:13.783 --> 00:27:15.482
I've never seen anyone start...

00:27:15.483 --> 00:27:16.982
from above water and not below it.

00:27:16.983 --> 00:27:18.122
He's a pro.

00:27:18.123 --> 00:27:19.383
(That's amazing.)

00:27:20.253 --> 00:27:21.623
You look good!

00:27:24.223 --> 00:27:25.463
He's good.

00:27:25.923 --> 00:27:27.793
- No way. - He's incredibly good.

00:27:30.033 --> 00:27:31.632
That's amazing!

00:27:31.633 --> 00:27:34.203
- You're so cool, Ji Yung! - Awesome!

00:27:35.503 --> 00:27:36.643
Fantastic.

00:27:38.003 --> 00:27:39.873
It would be fun if I could ride it like him.

00:27:40.043 --> 00:27:41.373
That's so cool.

00:27:42.843 --> 00:27:44.143
Look at those thighs.

00:27:44.383 --> 00:27:46.243
He rules the water.

00:27:53.593 --> 00:27:57.362
Is that the catfish crossing the Bukhan River?

00:27:57.363 --> 00:27:58.422
(Laughing)

00:27:58.423 --> 00:27:59.662
- Catfish. - Totally.

00:27:59.663 --> 00:28:01.392
- That's our catfish. - Totally.

00:28:01.393 --> 00:28:03.733
Catfish in the Bukhan River.

00:28:04.833 --> 00:28:07.203
- I wish I could get up. - What's that?

00:28:07.433 --> 00:28:09.332
- I want to do it like him. - Do you?

00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:11.202
(Hyeon Jun also wants to look cool in front of Yeong Gyeong.)

00:28:11.203 --> 00:28:12.602
But that takes even men...

00:28:12.603 --> 00:28:14.342
to try 2 to 3 times to actually get up.

00:28:14.343 --> 00:28:16.243
None of them can get up on the first day.

00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:20.713
Let's see.

00:28:20.883 --> 00:28:23.083
I'm not that athletic, so...

00:28:23.783 --> 00:28:24.952
Do I sit first?

00:28:24.953 --> 00:28:27.923
- Good luck! - Good luck, Hyeon Jun!

00:28:28.793 --> 00:28:29.822
Okay!

00:28:29.823 --> 00:28:31.763
- Yes, that's how you start. - Exactly.

00:28:33.263 --> 00:28:34.462
Let's go.

00:28:34.463 --> 00:28:36.092
(He fails on the first try.)

00:28:36.093 --> 00:28:38.003
- Good job. - That's normal.

00:28:38.103 --> 00:28:39.432
- Well done. - You can do it.

00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:40.503
You've got this.

00:28:40.903 --> 00:28:42.502
- Here we go. - Yes!

00:28:42.503 --> 00:28:44.502
(After that, )

00:28:44.503 --> 00:28:46.842
(he kept failing.)

00:28:46.843 --> 00:28:48.813
- Cheer up! You're getting there. - Go!

00:28:50.013 --> 00:28:51.883
Get up now!

00:28:52.443 --> 00:28:53.753
Oh, he almost had it.

00:28:54.013 --> 00:28:55.082
He's got the hang of it.

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:56.952
- He's got it now. - Yes.

00:28:56.953 --> 00:28:58.323
(Hyeon Jun's final attempt)

00:28:58.723 --> 00:29:00.052
Please.

00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:01.053
Oh, no.

00:29:01.054 --> 00:29:04.493
He almost made it, though. That was so close.

00:29:05.263 --> 00:29:06.292
Well done, though.

00:29:06.293 --> 00:29:07.863
- Good job. - It was great.

00:29:10.163 --> 00:29:11.702
I bet Ji Won is good.

00:29:11.703 --> 00:29:14.202
- I have a feeling she'll do it. - I know.

00:29:14.203 --> 00:29:15.372
I bet she'll get up right away.

00:29:15.373 --> 00:29:17.003
- Right away. - Right away.

00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:18.972
Relax your body.

00:29:18.973 --> 00:29:19.973
(Ji Won tries wakeboarding for the first time.)

00:29:19.974 --> 00:29:22.573
- She's getting up. - Let's go!

00:29:23.483 --> 00:29:24.543
Oh, no.

00:29:24.783 --> 00:29:26.712
- She's so good! - No way.

00:29:26.713 --> 00:29:29.483
- She might float soon. - I think she'll make it.

00:29:30.683 --> 00:29:32.423
Don't get up right away!

00:29:33.793 --> 00:29:35.323
How would that make me look?

00:29:37.363 --> 00:29:38.393
He's so humorous.

00:29:38.463 --> 00:29:40.193
I think I can do it with him coaching me.

00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:42.363
I hope she'll get up.

00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:43.902
Get up slowly.

00:29:43.903 --> 00:29:44.962
Slowly!

00:29:44.963 --> 00:29:47.002
- Here we go. - Let's go.

00:29:47.003 --> 00:29:48.833
She seems relaxed. We're moving. Oh, my.

00:29:51.673 --> 00:29:53.312
(Ji Won gets up on her second attempt.)

00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:55.173
That's insane!

00:29:55.843 --> 00:29:57.613
(Impressed)

00:29:57.743 --> 00:29:58.943
(I'm amazed. That's awesome.)

00:29:59.343 --> 00:30:01.583
- She's so cool. She's incredible. - Impressive.

00:30:03.783 --> 00:30:06.152
- She's doing it! - Okay. She did a great job.

00:30:06.153 --> 00:30:09.423
Good. Keep your arms straight. Keep them straight.

00:30:09.693 --> 00:30:11.923
That was crazy. She's so amazing.

00:30:13.893 --> 00:30:14.893
Good.

00:30:14.894 --> 00:30:16.903
(This is so much fun.)

00:30:17.163 --> 00:30:18.563
You're doing so well.

00:30:18.603 --> 00:30:21.073
- She'll release the handle. - Okay!

00:30:22.373 --> 00:30:24.402
(Amazed)

00:30:24.403 --> 00:30:26.243
- She's so good at it. - She did a great job.

00:30:26.573 --> 00:30:27.973
No!

00:30:29.883 --> 00:30:31.583
I'm glad she came here.

00:30:32.513 --> 00:30:35.413
I should've joined the other group and done some triple axels.

00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:39.252
Yeong Gyeong, go and ride a jet ski.

00:30:39.253 --> 00:30:40.523
- Shall I go now? - Yes.

00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:43.462
Yeong Gyeong doesn't seem like a person...

00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:45.023
who would like sports like this.

00:30:45.123 --> 00:30:46.123
You look cool.

00:30:46.124 --> 00:30:47.764
(Yeong Gyeong sits in the driver's seat.)

00:30:49.093 --> 00:30:50.902
He has a big physique, but is not good at sports.

00:30:50.903 --> 00:30:51.903
(Hyeon Jun sits in the rear seat shyly.)

00:30:51.904 --> 00:30:52.984
Yeong Gyeong looks so cool.

00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:56.349
(Yeong Gyeong looks so cool. Hyeon Jun is impressed.)

00:30:56.373 --> 00:30:58.373
- Bye. - Bye.

00:30:59.003 --> 00:31:00.342
Hold me.

00:31:00.343 --> 00:31:01.442
(Hold me tight.)

00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:03.343
- I'll hold you. - Okay.

00:31:04.313 --> 00:31:05.313
(Vroom)

00:31:06.853 --> 00:31:08.583
- Where shall we go? - Yeong Gyeong.

00:31:08.883 --> 00:31:10.799
- He's holding her waist tightly. - Yes, Hyeon Jun.

00:31:10.823 --> 00:31:12.303
He's such a big man and scared of it.

00:31:12.423 --> 00:31:15.393
(Smiling)

00:31:16.353 --> 00:31:18.263
You can go faster. I'm holding you tightly.

00:31:19.463 --> 00:31:20.863
She's cool.

00:31:22.593 --> 00:31:25.563
- Step on it! - That's funny.

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:26.773
"Step on it."

00:31:26.833 --> 00:31:29.272
Yeong Gyeong is so cool.

00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:30.273
It's good to see them like that.

00:31:30.274 --> 00:31:31.742
I haven't been this excited since the show began.

00:31:31.743 --> 00:31:32.903
- Really? - Yes.

00:31:34.473 --> 00:31:35.643
Today is the best day ever?

00:31:35.943 --> 00:31:37.343
I haven't been this excited before.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:38.743
I'm glad to hear that.

00:31:38.943 --> 00:31:40.453
Hyeon Jun is cute.

00:31:40.953 --> 00:31:42.813
Actually,

00:31:42.983 --> 00:31:45.082
we spent time together for the first time...

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:47.993
since we had spicy catfish stew together.

00:31:48.653 --> 00:31:52.323
Being with him made my heart flutter more than I expected.

00:31:54.263 --> 00:31:56.033
This is exciting.

00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:59.203
I'm so happy now.

00:31:59.363 --> 00:32:01.503
- Really? - Yes. I'm really happy.

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:02.833
(Chuckling)

00:32:02.834 --> 00:32:04.442
Maybe because of Hyeon Jun,

00:32:04.443 --> 00:32:06.083
it can't seem to go as fast as it should.

00:32:08.043 --> 00:32:09.143
I'm so hungry.

00:32:09.373 --> 00:32:10.613
Shall we eat something?

00:32:10.813 --> 00:32:12.082
- Ramyeon. - Ramyeon.

00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:13.283
Han River ramyeon.

00:32:14.183 --> 00:32:15.382
(Ramyeon after playing in water)

00:32:15.383 --> 00:32:17.522
It tastes even better after you play in water.

00:32:17.523 --> 00:32:18.783
- It tastes so good. - Indeed.

00:32:20.053 --> 00:32:21.853
- Here's your ramyeon. - But it made a noise.

00:32:22.053 --> 00:32:23.662
Thank you. Oh, do we have chopsticks?

00:32:23.663 --> 00:32:24.903
- I brought chopsticks. - Okay.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:26.363
It was cooked very quickly.

00:32:28.693 --> 00:32:30.833
It looks delicious.

00:32:32.203 --> 00:32:33.502
Why are my hands shaking?

00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:34.503
Me too.

00:32:34.933 --> 00:32:36.473
I can't use chopsticks.

00:32:37.143 --> 00:32:39.203
Enjoying water sports is much better than skating.

00:32:39.403 --> 00:32:41.123
- Don't you think so? - It's better, right?

00:32:42.013 --> 00:32:43.942
- Isn't this place better? Yes. - Is this place better?

00:32:43.943 --> 00:32:45.113
Why do you look upset?

00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:47.453
- You're not? - Oh, boy.

00:32:50.323 --> 00:32:51.382
(Looking at her cautiously)

00:32:51.383 --> 00:32:54.052
But if we went to the ice rink,

00:32:54.053 --> 00:32:56.593
we could've skated in an elegant, graceful manner.

00:32:57.963 --> 00:33:00.032
But whom you're with is the most important thing, right?

00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:01.963
- You're right. I agree. - Right.

00:33:11.643 --> 00:33:14.613
- Oh, boy. That's not good. - What's funny is...

00:33:14.773 --> 00:33:17.713
that there's tension between them even though Sang Won isn't here.

00:33:17.983 --> 00:33:19.312
- That's right. - Because they're here together.

00:33:19.313 --> 00:33:20.582
I feel the tension between them.

00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:21.652
The atmosphere is heavy.

00:33:21.653 --> 00:33:22.883
(I feel bad.)

00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:25.552
- Let's go. - Can you open the trunk?

00:33:25.553 --> 00:33:27.473
(Team Below Zero arrived before the other team.)

00:33:27.953 --> 00:33:28.953
I'll carry the bag.

00:33:29.223 --> 00:33:30.263
Okay.

00:33:31.263 --> 00:33:33.793
(Yeon House)

00:33:34.533 --> 00:33:35.963
Isn't your bag heavy?

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:39.063
It's heavy, but I'm okay.

00:33:40.203 --> 00:33:42.772
- It looks bigger than your body. - Exactly.

00:33:42.773 --> 00:33:44.542
- I packed so much stuff... - I was going to carry it for you,

00:33:44.543 --> 00:33:45.842
- Really? Thank you. - but it seemed...

00:33:45.843 --> 00:33:47.142
like part of your fashion style.

00:33:47.143 --> 00:33:48.143
No, that's not the case.

00:33:48.343 --> 00:33:50.842
Why doesn't anyone carry it for me? I'm joking.

00:33:50.843 --> 00:33:52.403
I was really going to carry it for you.

00:33:53.383 --> 00:33:55.582
(Sang Hyeon shows no response to what So Hyun said.)

00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.853
I tend to carry a lot of stuff in my bag.

00:34:00.793 --> 00:34:02.052
That was fun, eveyone.

00:34:02.053 --> 00:34:04.493
You can give me back my bag now. Thank you for your help.

00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.363
I helped you because I wanted to.

00:34:06.463 --> 00:34:07.663
- Don't worry. - I understand.

00:34:09.163 --> 00:34:10.202
(Sighing)

00:34:10.203 --> 00:34:12.232
She's sighing. I feel so bad for her.

00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:13.303
She looks tired.

00:34:13.773 --> 00:34:15.473
That was fun.

00:34:15.503 --> 00:34:17.572
Thank you for driving.

00:34:17.573 --> 00:34:18.573
Thank you.

00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:21.943
- See you later. - See you.

00:34:24.783 --> 00:34:27.683
- We arrived before them. - I thought that was the case.

00:34:28.883 --> 00:34:30.953
- I guess we can rest for a bit. - Right.

00:34:31.983 --> 00:34:33.592
I'll stay in my bed for a while.

00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:34.693
Are you tired?

00:34:36.823 --> 00:34:39.522
Let me tell you what I tried to say earlier.

00:34:39.523 --> 00:34:41.209
(So Hyun seems to have something to say to Bon Hee.)

00:34:41.233 --> 00:34:43.962
We didn't go there just to hang out.

00:34:43.963 --> 00:34:48.233
But Mu Jin was the only one who seemed to think of it as a date.

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:52.402
It was nice that he enjoyed skating...

00:34:52.403 --> 00:34:55.472
like an innocent child.

00:34:55.473 --> 00:34:56.549
She's talking about Sang Hyeon.

00:34:56.573 --> 00:34:58.743
But somehow I felt...

00:34:59.543 --> 00:35:00.753
I felt awkward.

00:35:01.213 --> 00:35:02.282
Because he didn't take care of you?

00:35:02.283 --> 00:35:04.353
No, that's not the reason.

00:35:04.623 --> 00:35:06.723
I just thought...

00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:09.653
that he was insensitive and tactless.

00:35:10.463 --> 00:35:11.862
That's what I thought.

00:35:11.863 --> 00:35:14.163
Actually, he cared too much about the others.

00:35:14.733 --> 00:35:16.463
He was being too careful.

00:35:17.203 --> 00:35:18.532
(Realizing)

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:19.732
- I mean... - You're right.

00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:22.103
He should do as his heart says,

00:35:22.403 --> 00:35:23.842
but he can't stop thinking too much.

00:35:23.843 --> 00:35:25.672
He keeps worrying so much about the consequences of his behaviors.

00:35:25.673 --> 00:35:27.642
That's how he seems to me.

00:35:27.643 --> 00:35:30.243
I do understand that he feels that way.

00:35:31.383 --> 00:35:33.552
But since I've been the one to lead,

00:35:33.553 --> 00:35:35.453
I'd like him to lead now. I like being led.

00:35:36.983 --> 00:35:38.053
That's why...

00:35:40.353 --> 00:35:42.052
That's why I got stressed out earlier.

00:35:42.053 --> 00:35:44.392
- I see. - I see why she was stressed.

00:35:44.393 --> 00:35:46.323
- Right. - Also, I saw...

00:35:47.463 --> 00:35:51.033
Sang Won tried to leave us alone when no one asked.

00:35:51.663 --> 00:35:52.963
I found him considerate.

00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:54.532
He has such good manners.

00:35:54.533 --> 00:35:56.102
Right. He seems naturally well-mannered.

00:35:56.103 --> 00:35:58.373
Exactly. He's thoughtful and tactful.

00:35:59.573 --> 00:36:01.513
I'm curious about Sang Won's feelings.

00:36:03.713 --> 00:36:06.842
So I wanted to talk more...

00:36:06.843 --> 00:36:09.313
to Mu Jin and Sang Won.

00:36:10.113 --> 00:36:11.482
I mean, I can talk to them, but...

00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:12.783
What's going on?

00:36:15.123 --> 00:36:17.992
I know I should respect both you and Mu Jin's feelings,

00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:22.233
but I don't think I should avoid talking to him because of you.

00:36:23.233 --> 00:36:25.132
It might bother you,

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:26.703
but you said you didn't care.

00:36:27.173 --> 00:36:29.573
When I am talking in private,

00:36:29.603 --> 00:36:33.943
I'm not sure if I should refrain from telling him how I feel.

00:36:34.873 --> 00:36:37.712
If you want to show your feelings, you can go ahead and tell him.

00:36:37.713 --> 00:36:40.852
It's possible that more than one girl is interested in the same man.

00:36:40.853 --> 00:36:42.882
- That's right. It's possible. - If one of them expresses...

00:36:42.883 --> 00:36:44.953
If one of them expresses their feeling,

00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:46.922
- it's the same... - That I care about him.

00:36:46.923 --> 00:36:49.123
As telling the other not to approach the guy.

00:36:49.653 --> 00:36:51.922
And I don't really care...

00:36:51.923 --> 00:36:54.263
about things like that.

00:36:54.893 --> 00:36:57.033
So it's up to you whether or not you tell him.

00:36:57.963 --> 00:36:59.932
It might bother you,

00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:01.403
but you said you didn't care.

00:37:01.973 --> 00:37:04.543
How can I not care about it? Of course, I care about it.

00:37:05.603 --> 00:37:09.142
I didn't mean I didn't care like it doesn't bother me at all.

00:37:09.143 --> 00:37:11.782
- But I can't tell you what to do. - Right.

00:37:11.783 --> 00:37:14.613
Even though it bothers me, that's not something I can control.

00:37:14.783 --> 00:37:16.153
That's what I meant by that.

00:37:17.183 --> 00:37:18.922
We still have a few days left,

00:37:18.923 --> 00:37:21.893
so I think it's a good idea to talk more to other guys.

00:37:22.423 --> 00:37:24.463
And the two of them are the ones I want to talk to.

00:37:26.323 --> 00:37:29.633
(So Hyun said she wanted to talk to Mu Jin, which bothers Bon Hee.)

00:37:30.033 --> 00:37:33.462
I really like that she shared her thoughts openly and honestly.

00:37:33.463 --> 00:37:34.679
(It's good that she shared her thoughts openly and honestly.)

00:37:34.703 --> 00:37:35.802
(So Hyun is so cool.)

00:37:35.803 --> 00:37:39.072
How do you think So Hyun's feelings changed...

00:37:39.073 --> 00:37:40.872
after the date?

00:37:40.873 --> 00:37:43.542
- It didn't occur after the date. - I see.

00:37:43.543 --> 00:37:46.883
I think her feelings changed to some extent during the date.

00:37:47.513 --> 00:37:51.653
In that sense, I believe she chose Mu Jin intentionally.

00:37:52.123 --> 00:37:53.952
The man she told she was interested in...

00:37:53.953 --> 00:37:57.523
was being indifferent toward her.

00:37:57.963 --> 00:37:59.262
So she decided...

00:37:59.263 --> 00:38:02.932
to choose Mu Jin whom she was interested in at first.

00:38:02.933 --> 00:38:04.902
Then she had fun with Mu Jin making light physical contact.

00:38:04.903 --> 00:38:05.903
(Yes, she did.)

00:38:05.904 --> 00:38:08.373
Right now, it seems to me...

00:38:08.503 --> 00:38:11.042
that she probably has two separate rooms in her heart now.

00:38:11.043 --> 00:38:13.972
She must've developed feelings for someone else as well.

00:38:13.973 --> 00:38:16.289
(So Hyun developed feelings for someone else but Sang Hyeon?)

00:38:16.313 --> 00:38:19.543
I was so out of it earlier today.

00:38:20.043 --> 00:38:21.813
Did things not go as you wanted?

00:38:22.253 --> 00:38:23.782
It's not like that.

00:38:23.783 --> 00:38:25.752
I didn't know what to do.

00:38:25.753 --> 00:38:27.593
And there was one thing...

00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.553
I realized through the date.

00:38:30.123 --> 00:38:32.963
When I'm with a group of people...

00:38:33.763 --> 00:38:36.063
- including someone I like, - You can't take care of her?

00:38:36.333 --> 00:38:38.902
I can't do anything.

00:38:38.903 --> 00:38:40.232
So he's always like that.

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:41.602
You're comfortable around her when you're alone with her?

00:38:41.603 --> 00:38:43.742
- You rather feel comfortable then? - Yes, when it's just the two of us.

00:38:43.743 --> 00:38:44.949
(He doesn't know how to express in front of a group of people.)

00:38:44.973 --> 00:38:47.472
I didn't know what I should do.

00:38:47.473 --> 00:38:49.072
- I know what you mean. - So I...

00:38:49.073 --> 00:38:51.219
I could tell that you were worried about it during the date.

00:38:51.243 --> 00:38:53.683
He's inept in dating.

00:38:57.923 --> 00:39:01.122
(Sang Hyeon changes his clothes feeling troubled.)

00:39:01.123 --> 00:39:04.963
(And he comes out to the terrace alone.)

00:39:06.963 --> 00:39:08.563
(Sighing)

00:39:09.293 --> 00:39:12.133
Sang Hyeon doesn't seem to have much dating experience.

00:39:14.903 --> 00:39:17.172
He finds it difficult to approach the person he likes.

00:39:17.173 --> 00:39:18.872
- I think so too. - Right?

00:39:18.873 --> 00:39:19.949
(Sang Hyeon has a lot on his mind.)

00:39:19.973 --> 00:39:22.442
(Meanwhile, Mu Jin and Sang Won are resting in their room.)

00:39:22.443 --> 00:39:24.519
How did you feel about going on a date with Bon Hee?

00:39:24.543 --> 00:39:25.712
You were happy, right?

00:39:25.713 --> 00:39:26.913
So Hyun was there too.

00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:30.013
Sang Hyeon and I took care of So Hyun.

00:39:33.383 --> 00:39:34.953
It was more fun than I thought.

00:39:36.293 --> 00:39:38.393
Will you talk to Ji Won when she comes back?

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:40.433
Well... I don't know.

00:39:42.693 --> 00:39:44.033
Things got so complicated.

00:39:44.463 --> 00:39:45.863
We don't have much time left now.

00:39:46.903 --> 00:39:49.103
Whatever. I was annoyed by the uneven gender ratio.

00:39:49.973 --> 00:39:51.843
I was so upset.

00:39:53.303 --> 00:39:55.013
I understand why he was upset.

00:39:55.113 --> 00:39:56.812
That's why I wanted to drive.

00:39:56.813 --> 00:39:58.643
- Really? - So that you guys could talk.

00:40:00.513 --> 00:40:01.983
Oh, goodness.

00:40:02.083 --> 00:40:04.553
- He must be upset. - Our director. I'm upset for him.

00:40:06.723 --> 00:40:10.693
(So Hyun comes out of the room and heads somewhere.)

00:40:13.123 --> 00:40:14.262
(She arrives at the men's room?)

00:40:14.263 --> 00:40:15.392
Isn't it Mu Jin's room?

00:40:15.393 --> 00:40:17.862
- Yes, it's Mu Jin's. - It's Mu Jin's room.

00:40:17.863 --> 00:40:19.433
(Whom is So Hyun looking for?)

00:40:22.373 --> 00:40:23.602
What?

00:40:23.603 --> 00:40:25.323
Oh, the one she's looking for is not there.

00:40:28.743 --> 00:40:31.343
(Thinking hard and hesitating)

00:40:38.953 --> 00:40:40.923
The color of the sky is beautiful.

00:40:41.123 --> 00:40:42.453
(Surprised)

00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:55.333
(So Hyun quietly stands in front of Sang Hyeon.)

00:40:56.103 --> 00:40:57.103
(Standing up)

00:40:57.773 --> 00:40:59.873
The color of the sky is really beautiful.

00:41:00.173 --> 00:41:03.013
Good. Do something when you're alone with her.

00:41:03.743 --> 00:41:05.282
Have the others come yet?

00:41:05.283 --> 00:41:08.013
I haven't seen them. I've been in my room until now.

00:41:08.383 --> 00:41:10.543
I came out to hang out with others and found you here.

00:41:14.023 --> 00:41:16.823
I had a tough time earlier today.

00:41:17.123 --> 00:41:18.339
- It was hard for me. - You had a tough time?

00:41:18.363 --> 00:41:19.792
It was hard in another way.

00:41:19.793 --> 00:41:21.893
So I wanted to spend some time alone.

00:41:23.393 --> 00:41:25.133
(Sighing)

00:41:26.133 --> 00:41:30.103
(Sang Hyeon can't open up about his feelings easily.)

00:41:31.243 --> 00:41:34.173
- I have a question. - Fire away. What is it?

00:41:34.843 --> 00:41:37.013
- Earlier today, I felt... - Yes?

00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:41.283
It was arranged as a date.

00:41:41.383 --> 00:41:43.212
- That's right. - Yes.

00:41:43.213 --> 00:41:46.552
But you just ran around like a puppy.

00:41:46.553 --> 00:41:49.792
- So it got me confused. - Oh, really?

00:41:49.793 --> 00:41:51.963
I was confused. I felt...

00:41:53.363 --> 00:41:55.993
- I realized something today. - Okay.

00:41:56.393 --> 00:41:58.833
When I go on a double date or when I'm with other people too,

00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.502
I don't just become a fool but also don't know what to do...

00:42:01.503 --> 00:42:03.733
which makes me act even more awkwardly.

00:42:05.643 --> 00:42:08.743
What makes a double date different from a 1-on-1 date?

00:42:09.373 --> 00:42:12.613
When I'm alone with my date, I'm able to think...

00:42:12.713 --> 00:42:15.453
about what I can help her with...

00:42:15.753 --> 00:42:18.952
and what she can do by herself.

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.593
And I can act naturally.

00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:24.292
What are the things that I can do on my own...

00:42:24.293 --> 00:42:27.532
and that I need help with on a date at an ice rink?

00:42:27.533 --> 00:42:29.232
We just skate together. That's all.

00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:31.003
- And we have fun. - That's right.

00:42:31.433 --> 00:42:32.663
Did I skate too well?

00:42:33.103 --> 00:42:34.783
Was there nothing I needed your help with?

00:42:35.573 --> 00:42:37.972
It's not like that. I thought...

00:42:37.973 --> 00:42:40.403
- Here's what I thought at first. - Okay.

00:42:41.473 --> 00:42:44.782
I thought you needed to talk more...

00:42:44.783 --> 00:42:46.513
- to the other guys as well. - Yes.

00:42:47.143 --> 00:42:48.982
But then I couldn't help but see...

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:51.223
how Mu Jin took care of you.

00:42:51.953 --> 00:42:54.122
Watching you guys like that,

00:42:54.123 --> 00:42:56.953
I didn't know what I should do.

00:42:57.563 --> 00:43:00.693
I just thought, "Am I being jealous right now?"

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:03.533
- Oh, so it was because of Mu Jin. - No wonder.

00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:06.733
Gosh. It drives me crazy.

00:43:09.203 --> 00:43:11.603
I was like, "Should I do something?"

00:43:12.043 --> 00:43:13.672
And when I tried to do something,

00:43:13.673 --> 00:43:16.613
I felt so awkward for no reason.

00:43:18.243 --> 00:43:20.143
- He felt uncomfortable. - Right.

00:43:20.543 --> 00:43:22.313
- Oh, my. - He was already uncomfortable...

00:43:22.413 --> 00:43:25.453
around Mu Jin because of his relationship with Bon Hee.

00:43:25.553 --> 00:43:28.092
On top of that, Mu Jin stayed close...

00:43:28.093 --> 00:43:29.853
to the woman who liked me.

00:43:29.953 --> 00:43:32.863
It wasn't Mu Jin's choice but So Hyun's, though.

00:43:33.363 --> 00:43:36.033
Anyway, all those things...

00:43:36.233 --> 00:43:38.403
created an uncomfortable situation for Sang Hyeon.

00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:41.133
I was like, "Should I do something?"

00:43:41.603 --> 00:43:43.202
And when I tried to do something,

00:43:43.203 --> 00:43:46.243
I felt so awkward for no reason.

00:43:47.643 --> 00:43:49.243
What were you going to do?

00:43:50.513 --> 00:43:52.343
I was... Don't ask.

00:43:52.883 --> 00:43:54.813
I was going to be more attentive.

00:43:55.983 --> 00:43:59.322
Watching someone else did it for you...

00:43:59.323 --> 00:44:01.653
while I was contemplating doing something for you...

00:44:03.123 --> 00:44:04.722
I wished I were the one who did it for you.

00:44:04.723 --> 00:44:06.423
Such thoughts crossed my mind.

00:44:06.993 --> 00:44:08.293
That's what happened.

00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:09.463
There's nothing wrong about being inept.

00:44:09.464 --> 00:44:10.563
- Of course. - Yes.

00:44:10.663 --> 00:44:15.103
Exactly. I know that you're the type...

00:44:15.933 --> 00:44:19.173
that always thinks long and hard about everything, but...

00:44:20.773 --> 00:44:22.493
- What I can tell you is... - I don't know.

00:44:24.683 --> 00:44:26.543
That you should put your thoughts into action.

00:44:27.583 --> 00:44:28.982
- She sure is older than him. - Right.

00:44:28.983 --> 00:44:31.683
Why do you think too much? It's pointless if you don't act.

00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:34.052
That's my advice to you.

00:44:34.053 --> 00:44:35.092
(Did the conversation relieve So Hyun's frustration?)

00:44:35.093 --> 00:44:36.392
Gosh, I hate myself.

00:44:36.393 --> 00:44:39.023
(Did the conversation relieve So Hyun's frustration?)

00:44:40.793 --> 00:44:42.833
- It sure is pretty. - The same color as mackerel.

00:44:42.933 --> 00:44:45.333
I'll show you some time. It's really cute.

00:44:45.663 --> 00:44:47.833
It must be so adorable. What's its name?

00:44:47.933 --> 00:44:49.402
- It's Leo. - Leo?

00:44:49.403 --> 00:44:50.903
It's quite a common name.

00:44:51.003 --> 00:44:52.042
I think it looks handsome.

00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:53.703
Indeed. It's pretty and handsome.

00:44:53.803 --> 00:44:56.072
So Hyun said she had a cat too.

00:44:56.073 --> 00:44:57.073
I think I heard that.

00:44:57.743 --> 00:44:58.743
They have something in common.

00:44:58.744 --> 00:45:00.682
I think So Hyun looks like a cat.

00:45:00.683 --> 00:45:01.712
Doesn't she?

00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:04.723
What about Ji Won? Does she have a cat face?

00:45:06.283 --> 00:45:07.753
No, Ji Won...

00:45:08.653 --> 00:45:10.422
is more like a puppy, I think.

00:45:10.423 --> 00:45:11.922
She has a personality like puppies.

00:45:11.923 --> 00:45:12.923
That's right, she does...

00:45:12.924 --> 00:45:15.192
She looks that way because she always smiles.

00:45:15.193 --> 00:45:17.362
- She's like a Golden Retriever. - Right.

00:45:17.363 --> 00:45:18.443
She has a good personality.

00:45:19.563 --> 00:45:21.033
- She's considerate. - Right.

00:45:21.333 --> 00:45:24.213
She's a good listener, she initiates conversations well, and she's kind.

00:45:25.073 --> 00:45:26.843
And that makes me feel comfortable.

00:45:29.113 --> 00:45:30.233
I think she's a good person.

00:45:31.913 --> 00:45:34.043
But I think I might've made her uncomfortable.

00:45:35.453 --> 00:45:37.413
To be honest, I'm not sure if it's because of me.

00:45:38.153 --> 00:45:39.222
I wonder if it's only because of me...

00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:42.223
or because she's still confused about her own feelings.

00:45:43.023 --> 00:45:44.763
She doesn't have interest only in me.

00:45:44.863 --> 00:45:47.463
She said she wanted to talk to the other guys too.

00:45:47.933 --> 00:45:49.862
So I want to know if she's not sure about her feelings.

00:45:49.863 --> 00:45:52.009
(Sang Won can't stop thinking about Ji Won's feelings.)

00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:53.132
They're coming back.

00:45:53.133 --> 00:45:54.802
(Team Over Zero arrives right then.)

00:45:54.803 --> 00:45:55.973
They must not have come yet.

00:45:56.903 --> 00:45:58.649
- Haven't they come yet? - I don't think so.

00:45:58.673 --> 00:46:00.603
- Hello. - What took you so long?

00:46:01.313 --> 00:46:02.342
- Hi. - Sorry?

00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:04.073
They all seem out of energy.

00:46:04.743 --> 00:46:05.813
They must've had fun.

00:46:06.213 --> 00:46:07.312
It was so much fun.

00:46:07.313 --> 00:46:09.453
I'm jealous. I wish I had tried water sports.

00:46:09.553 --> 00:46:10.553
- Really? - It was fun.

00:46:10.554 --> 00:46:12.252
All of you seem so exhausted.

00:46:12.253 --> 00:46:14.613
- It was extremely exhausting. - You look really exhausted.

00:46:14.793 --> 00:46:16.513
- She fell into water. - I fell into water.

00:46:16.893 --> 00:46:18.722
- We couldn't have dinner. - We couldn't have dinner.

00:46:18.723 --> 00:46:20.062
My stomach is empty.

00:46:20.063 --> 00:46:21.232
- I'm hungry. - You look so tired.

00:46:21.233 --> 00:46:23.192
I want to eat some cheesecake.

00:46:23.193 --> 00:46:24.332
Eat the one that isn't open yet.

00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:26.493
- I want some coffee too. - Those who don't like it...

00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:28.002
You look so tired.

00:46:28.003 --> 00:46:30.003
- They really look... - Wash up and come back.

00:46:30.103 --> 00:46:31.572
- I need to eat something. - There could be nothing left.

00:46:31.573 --> 00:46:34.313
- We're out of it. - It's right there in the middle.

00:46:37.213 --> 00:46:39.743
I'll eat some cheesecake. I'm so hungry.

00:46:40.883 --> 00:46:42.083
- I'm starving. - Eat some,

00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:43.452
- What? - wash up, and come back.

00:46:43.453 --> 00:46:44.883
- I'll do it for you. - Thank you.

00:46:46.883 --> 00:46:49.093
- She's good at everything. - No way.

00:46:50.093 --> 00:46:52.993
She saw them. Ye Eun saw them. Oh, no.

00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:55.669
She's pretending she didn't see anything.

00:46:55.693 --> 00:46:56.733
She's good at everything?

00:46:57.963 --> 00:46:59.262
(Sang Won helps Ji Won as she's hungry.)

00:46:59.263 --> 00:47:01.073
Oh, my goodness.

00:47:01.503 --> 00:47:03.672
- It's hard to ignore. - This is a mess.

00:47:03.673 --> 00:47:05.502
- They're being so lovey-dovey. - Right.

00:47:05.503 --> 00:47:08.873
(And Ye Eun is watching Sang Won and Ji Won.)

00:47:09.713 --> 00:47:11.313
- Right? - Thank you.

00:47:12.183 --> 00:47:13.183
She's good at everything?

00:47:13.184 --> 00:47:14.913
- Really... - Did you try wakeboarding too?

00:47:15.013 --> 00:47:16.082
- Of course. - That must've been fun.

00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:18.323
- She's good at everything. - No way.

00:47:19.153 --> 00:47:23.193
It's hard for a beginner to stand up on a wakeboard.

00:47:24.053 --> 00:47:25.592
- But she made it. - You mean, Ji Won?

00:47:25.593 --> 00:47:27.522
- Yes. - Ji Won has talent in sports.

00:47:27.523 --> 00:47:28.633
She's really amazing.

00:47:29.863 --> 00:47:30.933
I mean it.

00:47:35.173 --> 00:47:37.303
I'm worried. She looks so exhausted.

00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:41.513
Don't I look okay either?

00:47:41.913 --> 00:47:43.672
- Don't I look okay? - You look tired.

00:47:43.673 --> 00:47:44.713
Right. I'm tired.

00:47:45.383 --> 00:47:47.482
- I dozed off in the car. - She stood up and rode it.

00:47:47.483 --> 00:47:49.203
- She looked so cool from behind. - No way.

00:47:50.313 --> 00:47:51.353
To be honest,

00:47:51.453 --> 00:47:52.682
- No way. - I'm not good at sports.

00:47:52.683 --> 00:47:54.422
I'll put in some ice. Do you need some?

00:47:54.423 --> 00:47:58.222
(The awkward tension between them continues because of Sang Won.)

00:47:58.223 --> 00:47:59.792
Oh, gosh. That's not good.

00:47:59.793 --> 00:48:02.293
I'll go upstairs, guys.

00:48:02.533 --> 00:48:04.303
I'll wash up and come back.

00:48:05.563 --> 00:48:07.533
All the guys gathered here.

00:48:07.833 --> 00:48:09.472
What will they talk about? I'm so curious.

00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:11.973
When we were talking in the car,

00:48:12.543 --> 00:48:14.773
there were so many topics that I didn't know.

00:48:15.173 --> 00:48:16.312
Topics that he doesn't know?

00:48:16.313 --> 00:48:19.382
We went to an ice skate rink, you know.

00:48:19.383 --> 00:48:21.253
- You mean, an ice rink. - Right, an ice rink.

00:48:21.683 --> 00:48:24.422
- We said we rode inline skates... - We said we knew...

00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.522
- how to ride them. - Right.

00:48:25.523 --> 00:48:28.192
- So... - She said she rode roller skates.

00:48:28.193 --> 00:48:29.523
She said "rollerblades."

00:48:31.263 --> 00:48:32.292
Roller rinks?

00:48:32.293 --> 00:48:34.993
- So we... - She said "rollerblades."

00:48:35.733 --> 00:48:36.733
Roller rinks?

00:48:36.793 --> 00:48:39.003
I've only seen a roller rink in a drama.

00:48:39.533 --> 00:48:40.702
He's seen it in a drama.

00:48:40.703 --> 00:48:42.532
- They talked about Se7en. - Oh, right. Se7en.

00:48:42.533 --> 00:48:44.103
- What? Who is Se7en? - Se7en...

00:48:44.403 --> 00:48:45.442
- What? - He asked who Se7en was.

00:48:45.443 --> 00:48:46.443
(They don't know Se7en?)

00:48:46.444 --> 00:48:47.719
(Se7en is a Korean singer who debuted with "Come Back to Me.")

00:48:47.743 --> 00:48:49.112
- What? Who is Se7en? - Se7en...

00:48:49.113 --> 00:48:51.743
- He debuted when we were little. - He's married to Lee Da Hae.

00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:54.953
You know the shoes that have wheels in the heel, right?

00:48:55.053 --> 00:48:58.053
Is it called Heelys? Anyway, Se7en used to wear them.

00:48:58.153 --> 00:48:59.582
They suddenly started talking about him,

00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:01.329
- and we couldn't hide our emotions. - Se7en...

00:49:01.353 --> 00:49:02.593
We were like, "What are those?"

00:49:02.793 --> 00:49:06.122
I mean, it was my first time hearing that word.

00:49:06.123 --> 00:49:07.623
- This is unbelievable. - So I was...

00:49:08.463 --> 00:49:09.832
How can this be happening?

00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:11.102
Oh, my gosh. What should we do?

00:49:11.103 --> 00:49:12.732
How old are they?

00:49:12.733 --> 00:49:13.733
(A single word made them feel the generation gap.)

00:49:13.734 --> 00:49:14.972
My goodness.

00:49:14.973 --> 00:49:16.532
Are they around SOOBIN's age?

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:17.602
This is fun.

00:49:17.603 --> 00:49:20.342
So there are five men around SOOBIN's age.

00:49:20.343 --> 00:49:21.343
- Right. - SOOBIN...

00:49:21.344 --> 00:49:24.172
- Could he be 24 or 25? - Is he 30... Is he 24?

00:49:24.173 --> 00:49:26.612
- Could he be that young? - I was sure they were in their 30s.

00:49:26.613 --> 00:49:27.642
- You mean, Ji Yung? - No.

00:49:27.643 --> 00:49:30.052
I thought most of the guys were in their 30s.

00:49:30.053 --> 00:49:31.053
I think they're in their early 30s.

00:49:31.054 --> 00:49:32.252
No. I think some of them are in their 20s.

00:49:32.253 --> 00:49:33.582
- They seem to be in their 20s. - Based on their reaction,

00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:34.892
they could be around my age.

00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:36.093
Se7en...

00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:37.452
Se7en...

00:49:37.453 --> 00:49:40.592
My sister is ten years older than me,

00:49:40.593 --> 00:49:42.433
and she was a huge K-pop fan, so I know him.

00:49:42.833 --> 00:49:45.662
But my friends don't know Se7en.

00:49:45.663 --> 00:49:46.732
That's understandable.

00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:48.833
- Can I ask you something? - What is it?

00:49:49.573 --> 00:49:51.743
Can you date a woman who's ten years older than you?

00:49:53.643 --> 00:49:55.843
I think I can, easily.

00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:57.172
- You can easily date one? - Really?

00:49:57.173 --> 00:49:59.312
- I wouldn't mind it at all. - He doesn't mind it.

00:49:59.313 --> 00:50:00.413
- I don't. - Goodness.

00:50:00.683 --> 00:50:02.112
- He doesn't mind it. - He's the real man.

00:50:02.113 --> 00:50:03.213
(My feelings matter more.)

00:50:04.553 --> 00:50:07.253
(You received a new message.)

00:50:07.853 --> 00:50:08.923
Oh.

00:50:09.093 --> 00:50:11.163
I think we got a message, guys.

00:50:11.563 --> 00:50:12.762
A message.

00:50:12.763 --> 00:50:14.762
(Your age will be revealed.)

00:50:14.763 --> 00:50:17.392
(Please gather at the yard.)

00:50:17.393 --> 00:50:18.663
- The age. - The age.

00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:20.633
Finally.

00:50:20.833 --> 00:50:22.549
- Their age will be revealed. - What will they do?

00:50:22.573 --> 00:50:23.832
We waited too long.

00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:25.503
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

00:50:26.643 --> 00:50:27.673
Finally.

00:50:29.043 --> 00:50:31.142
Our age will be revealed. No way.

00:50:31.143 --> 00:50:32.213
(My goodness!)

00:50:32.843 --> 00:50:35.552
(There are 10 beanbags in the yard.)

00:50:35.553 --> 00:50:37.213
Can we sit wherever we want?

00:50:37.683 --> 00:50:40.253
- Do we just sit? - Can we sit wherever we want?

00:50:40.923 --> 00:50:42.123
Anywhere?

00:50:42.853 --> 00:50:45.163
- Can we sit wherever we like? - I guess so.

00:50:47.793 --> 00:50:49.863
- I will sit here. - Sit here.

00:50:50.433 --> 00:50:51.463
Goodness.

00:50:52.303 --> 00:50:54.032
I took a shower and worked.

00:50:54.033 --> 00:50:55.372
- You did? - Yes.

00:50:55.373 --> 00:50:56.373
I will sit there because my left face is prettier.

00:50:56.374 --> 00:50:58.642
(Ji Won follows Sang Won.)

00:50:58.643 --> 00:51:00.073
I will sit here.

00:51:00.573 --> 00:51:04.113
(Sang Won sits between Ye Eun and Ji Won.)

00:51:04.943 --> 00:51:06.883
(Looking)

00:51:08.183 --> 00:51:10.113
(Bothered)

00:51:10.813 --> 00:51:13.423
Sang Won is sitting between Ji Won and Ye Eun.

00:51:13.653 --> 00:51:14.723
He is.

00:51:16.593 --> 00:51:18.793
Next to Mu Jin is So Hyun and Bon Hee.

00:51:18.868 --> 00:51:20.609
Sang Hyeon is sitting alone.

00:51:20.633 --> 00:51:22.733
Next to Mu Jin is So Hyun and Bon Hee.

00:51:23.211 --> 00:51:25.271
Sang Hyeon is sitting alone.

00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:28.141
(Sighing)

00:51:28.142 --> 00:51:29.241
I'm nervous.

00:51:30.811 --> 00:51:32.010
I'm so nervous...

00:51:32.011 --> 00:51:33.220
- that I don't know what to say. - I know.

00:51:33.221 --> 00:51:35.521
- Everyone just feels it. - Right.

00:51:36.021 --> 00:51:37.591
- That it's an important moment. - Yes.

00:51:39.991 --> 00:51:43.360
(It's an important moment they forgot about for a while.)

00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:46.130
Isn't it possible that things will go back to Day One?

00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:47.600
- Right. - Honestly?

00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:49.321
- Because of their ages? - Let's be honest.

00:51:49.901 --> 00:51:52.100
I don't know how big of an impact it will have.

00:51:52.101 --> 00:51:54.941
(They exchange glances in silence.)

00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:59.140
(And everyone's eyes gather at one spot.)

00:51:59.141 --> 00:52:00.510
- My goodness. - My goodness.

00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:03.881
(And everyone's eyes gather at one spot.)

00:52:04.681 --> 00:52:05.681
(Yeon House)

00:52:05.682 --> 00:52:08.650
(Chapter 1. Our Childhood)

00:52:08.651 --> 00:52:09.990
- No way. - Here we go.

00:52:09.991 --> 00:52:11.291
Childhood.

00:52:13.261 --> 00:52:14.361
Already.

00:52:14.491 --> 00:52:16.430
(Amazed)

00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:17.831
So pretty.

00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:19.761
- Adorable. - Is it a video?

00:52:22.661 --> 00:52:23.730
It's Ye Eun.

00:52:23.731 --> 00:52:25.800
(The 5-year-old Ye Eun dreamed of becoming a ballerina.)

00:52:25.801 --> 00:52:27.701
- It's so cool. - It's so cool.

00:52:28.141 --> 00:52:31.540
She's surprised to see her photo move.

00:52:31.541 --> 00:52:33.911
(Emotional)

00:52:34.211 --> 00:52:35.811
- What? - What?

00:52:36.211 --> 00:52:38.311
- Is it Ji Won? - Ji Won?

00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:42.480
(The 12-year-old Ji Won...)

00:52:42.481 --> 00:52:43.850
She used to play violin.

00:52:43.851 --> 00:52:48.891
(dreamed of becoming a violinist.)

00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:51.291
Goodness.

00:52:52.031 --> 00:52:53.230
They are all surprised...

00:52:53.231 --> 00:52:54.761
to see their photos.

00:52:54.931 --> 00:52:59.570
(The 7-year-old Yeong Gyeong had tanned skin.)

00:52:59.571 --> 00:53:00.641
Goodness.

00:53:01.641 --> 00:53:03.340
You said you had tanned skin as a child, and it was true.

00:53:03.341 --> 00:53:04.541
Yes, I had tanned skin.

00:53:04.711 --> 00:53:05.810
She's so pale-skinned now.

00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:06.911
- It's true. - Yes.

00:53:08.441 --> 00:53:10.481
So Hyun. So cute.

00:53:11.011 --> 00:53:12.250
- Adorable. - Fat cheeks.

00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:14.680
(The 5-year-old So Hyun had fat cheeks.)

00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:16.121
She looks the same.

00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:21.921
So Hyun. So cute.

00:53:25.991 --> 00:53:27.160
She's exactly the same.

00:53:27.161 --> 00:53:31.001
(The 9-year-old Bon Hee looked exactly the same as now.)

00:53:31.601 --> 00:53:32.931
So pretty.

00:53:35.841 --> 00:53:37.570
- It's me. - Is it you really?

00:53:37.571 --> 00:53:38.610
So cute.

00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:40.240
- He's so cute. - Why is he so cute?

00:53:40.241 --> 00:53:41.480
(The 4-year-old Mu Jin had the same smiles.)

00:53:41.481 --> 00:53:43.081
Mu Jin is super adorable.

00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:45.511
So adorable.

00:53:47.921 --> 00:53:50.291
Goodness.

00:53:51.491 --> 00:53:52.520
(Laughing)

00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:55.520
The one on the right is me.

00:53:55.521 --> 00:53:56.661
Cute.

00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:59.260
He looks exactly the same.

00:53:59.261 --> 00:54:03.631
(The lovely 6-year-old Sang Hyeon)

00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:05.601
Who is that? Hyeon Jun.

00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:07.370
- He's strong. - Cute.

00:54:07.371 --> 00:54:08.501
- Strong. - Cute.

00:54:09.141 --> 00:54:10.211
Hyeon Jun.

00:54:10.941 --> 00:54:12.211
Very similar.

00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:16.510
Who is that?

00:54:16.511 --> 00:54:17.881
- Sang Won. - Sang Won.

00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:22.350
He was a mischievous boy.

00:54:22.351 --> 00:54:23.820
- Clear eyes. - He looks the same.

00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:24.950
Look at him.

00:54:24.951 --> 00:54:26.290
- So handsome. - Goodness.

00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:27.361
So cute.

00:54:27.961 --> 00:54:29.761
- Goodness, so cute. - So cute.

00:54:30.531 --> 00:54:31.531
It's Ji Yung.

00:54:31.532 --> 00:54:33.160
- You were really close. - He looks the same.

00:54:33.161 --> 00:54:34.730
He's got an older sister.

00:54:34.731 --> 00:54:36.571
(The 4-year-old was very close to his sister.)

00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.671
You were really close.

00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.901
Isn't it strange that he once had thin arms?

00:54:42.801 --> 00:54:44.640
- Thin arms? - They are thin.

00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:46.071
What are you saying to a baby?

00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:49.641
"What are you saying to a baby?"

00:54:50.181 --> 00:54:51.650
(Chapter 2. Our 20s)

00:54:51.651 --> 00:54:52.951
- "Our 20s"? - "Our 20s"?

00:54:55.751 --> 00:54:57.291
What?

00:54:57.691 --> 00:54:58.921
It's Cyworld.

00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:01.321
- That's crazy. - So pretty.

00:55:03.431 --> 00:55:04.760
She's so pretty.

00:55:04.761 --> 00:55:08.160
(Ye Eun was very cute in her 20s.)

00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.201
- She looks the same. - She's the same.

00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:17.841
That's me.

00:55:18.171 --> 00:55:19.370
It's Ji Won.

00:55:19.371 --> 00:55:23.411
(Ji Won in her 20s is smiling brightly.)

00:55:24.411 --> 00:55:26.291
- Is that Yeong Gyeong? - Is that Yeong Gyeong?

00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:28.081
So cute.

00:55:30.321 --> 00:55:31.720
Everyone looks the same.

00:55:31.721 --> 00:55:33.220
(It's as if Yeong Gyeong was in her 20s just yesterday.)

00:55:33.221 --> 00:55:34.560
Yeong Gyeong...

00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:36.190
hasn't changed a bit.

00:55:36.191 --> 00:55:37.831
(Looking closely)

00:55:38.461 --> 00:55:39.491
My goodness.

00:55:40.101 --> 00:55:41.460
Goodness. She's got a different vibe.

00:55:41.461 --> 00:55:42.661
I know.

00:55:44.171 --> 00:55:45.200
(Bon Hee had a different vibe in her 20s.)

00:55:45.201 --> 00:55:47.001
- What? - Completely different.

00:55:47.441 --> 00:55:48.871
She had a really different vibe.

00:55:49.671 --> 00:55:52.610
Doesn't she remind us of Park Ji Yoon?

00:55:52.611 --> 00:55:53.911
- Right. - The singer.

00:55:53.981 --> 00:55:55.540
(Focused)

00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:56.980
So pretty.

00:55:56.981 --> 00:55:58.281
(Taking a peek)

00:56:01.551 --> 00:56:02.951
So cute.

00:56:03.651 --> 00:56:05.050
- So young. - She was a baby.

00:56:05.051 --> 00:56:06.291
Is it So Hyun?

00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:08.421
(Nodding)

00:56:09.791 --> 00:56:11.660
(Watching closely)

00:56:11.661 --> 00:56:13.760
(So Hyun was very youthful in her 20s.)

00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:14.860
So cute.

00:56:14.861 --> 00:56:17.401
(So Hyun was very youthful in her 20s.)

00:56:18.271 --> 00:56:20.271
I am curious to see the photos of the younger men.

00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:22.001
(Surprised)

00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.641
(Cute)

00:56:24.771 --> 00:56:25.940
I was in the army.

00:56:25.941 --> 00:56:27.280
- Really? - Were you in the army?

00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:29.480
- I was in the army. - He's good-looking.

00:56:29.481 --> 00:56:31.080
(The 20-year-old Mu Jin was a handsome young soldier.)

00:56:31.081 --> 00:56:32.710
He looks so young.

00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:34.251
He looks different from now.

00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:35.881
It's Sang Hyeon.

00:56:36.151 --> 00:56:37.591
Goodness.

00:56:40.291 --> 00:56:41.521
He's adorable.

00:56:41.691 --> 00:56:43.631
- He had fat cheeks. - He looks so innocent.

00:56:44.061 --> 00:56:45.630
He looks a little different.

00:56:45.631 --> 00:56:49.061
(The 20-year-old Sang Hyeon looked adorable.)

00:56:49.531 --> 00:56:51.200
It must be Hyeon Jun.

00:56:51.201 --> 00:56:52.400
(Is it Hyeon Jun?)

00:56:52.401 --> 00:56:54.671
- Why is he an adult? - Is it a long time ago?

00:56:55.741 --> 00:56:57.010
(The 20-year-old Hyeon Jun had a sharp jawline.)

00:56:57.011 --> 00:56:58.941
What? He looks amazing.

00:57:00.241 --> 00:57:01.481
Solid.

00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:04.611
- They are all good-looking. - When he was in medical school.

00:57:06.351 --> 00:57:08.681
(Interested)

00:57:09.121 --> 00:57:10.550
(The 20-year-old Sang Won...)

00:57:10.551 --> 00:57:11.620
Goodness.

00:57:11.621 --> 00:57:16.321
(was a bright medical student.)

00:57:16.491 --> 00:57:17.860
Why are you so good-looking?

00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:19.331
I was young then.

00:57:21.261 --> 00:57:23.400
- Goodness. - He was a baby.

00:57:23.401 --> 00:57:24.630
(The 20-year-old Ji Yung dreamed...)

00:57:24.631 --> 00:57:25.830
(of becoming a professional rugby player.)

00:57:25.831 --> 00:57:27.201
- Cute. - He's still big.

00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.770
- He looks different from now. - Right.

00:57:29.771 --> 00:57:32.040
I thought he wouldn't look different, but he looks different.

00:57:32.041 --> 00:57:34.641
(You came through the same era.)

00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.650
(Now, )

00:57:37.651 --> 00:57:39.510
(please reveal your age.)

00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:40.621
Oh, dear.

00:57:41.251 --> 00:57:42.351
Finally.

00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:43.650
(Today, they will find out each other's age.)

00:57:43.651 --> 00:57:45.151
It's better to get it over with.

00:57:45.391 --> 00:57:46.891
I'm so curious.

00:57:47.491 --> 00:57:48.591
Gosh.

00:57:48.691 --> 00:57:50.631
- The time has come. - The time has come.

00:57:51.561 --> 00:57:52.990
It's about time.

00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:54.960
(They put it behind for a while, but it's time to face it.)

00:57:54.961 --> 00:57:56.731
When their ages are revealed,

00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:59.770
who do you think will be more shaken?

00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:01.471
Men or women?

00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:05.670
I think it will be the ladies.

00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:08.681
They hinted it when they first appeared.

00:58:09.141 --> 00:58:10.511
"I've been too invested in work."

00:58:10.911 --> 00:58:12.680
"I don't know if I can fall in love again."

00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:15.280
I think once the reality hits,

00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:17.221
that feeling might resurface.

00:58:17.391 --> 00:58:20.760
- Yes. - The ladies will be shaken.

00:58:20.761 --> 00:58:22.661
But I want them to overcome it.

00:58:23.161 --> 00:58:24.291
I'm so curious.

00:58:26.731 --> 00:58:28.530
Finally, it's time.

00:58:28.531 --> 00:58:30.201
I was very nervous.

00:58:30.901 --> 00:58:33.101
What if I am too old?

00:58:33.341 --> 00:58:34.700
To be completely frank,

00:58:34.701 --> 00:58:36.741
what if they don't see me as a woman anymore?

00:58:37.311 --> 00:58:39.811
"He's that young?"

00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:41.940
"He's younger than I thought." She might not find me attractive.

00:58:41.941 --> 00:58:42.941
Both parties are worried.

00:58:42.942 --> 00:58:45.311
When she hears of my age,

00:58:45.881 --> 00:58:48.781
what will she think? I was worried about that.

00:58:49.581 --> 00:58:52.691
I worried, "What if our age difference is too big?"

00:58:53.361 --> 00:58:56.520
- Also, I have to be realistic. - Right.

00:58:56.521 --> 00:58:58.591
That worried me too.

00:58:58.631 --> 00:59:01.530
I got nervous, unconsciously.

00:59:01.531 --> 00:59:03.571
("Age" is the reality that will make them nervous.)

00:59:03.601 --> 00:59:05.770
(It's time to face reality.)

00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:07.441
The time has come.

00:59:09.541 --> 00:59:10.571
It's today.

00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:14.381
Goodness.

00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:16.811
Everyone became quiet.

00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:23.080
(Please reveal your age.)

00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:24.121
Should we point?

00:59:24.421 --> 00:59:26.020
Why don't we vote at the same time?

00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:28.021
The person who gets the most votes will go first?

00:59:28.061 --> 00:59:29.391
- Sounds good. - Okay.

00:59:31.261 --> 00:59:32.461
Who should I point?

00:59:33.701 --> 00:59:35.500
Isn't it like a popularity vote?

00:59:35.501 --> 00:59:36.770
(Whose age are they most curious to find out?)

00:59:36.771 --> 00:59:39.171
- It means they are interested. - They are most interested.

00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:41.940
Should we point to that person...

00:59:41.941 --> 00:59:43.041
on the count of three?

00:59:43.771 --> 00:59:45.670
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

00:59:45.671 --> 00:59:49.081
(Who will be the first person to reveal the age?)

00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:52.110
(Their eyes meet in the center.)

00:59:52.111 --> 00:59:53.211
Who is it?

00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:55.451
- It's Mu Jin. - It's Mu Jin.

00:59:56.921 --> 00:59:57.921
Mu Jin.

00:59:57.922 --> 01:00:00.521
(Mu Jin is the first person to reveal his age.)

01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:05.291
I'm nervous for him.

01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:09.661
I am...

01:00:12.931 --> 01:00:15.201
I was more worried about what Bon Hee...

01:00:15.401 --> 01:00:18.671
would think once my age...

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.541
is revealed.

01:00:23.111 --> 01:00:25.910
Realistically, it would be nice if I'm 4 or 5 years older.

01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.921
But I think he might be even younger than that.

01:00:28.421 --> 01:00:31.691
I just hoped that he would be a little older.

01:00:37.261 --> 01:00:38.261
I was...

01:00:40.601 --> 01:00:41.931
born in 19...

01:00:44.471 --> 01:00:46.301
I hope he's over 30.

01:00:47.801 --> 01:00:49.041
I was born...

01:00:50.311 --> 01:00:51.711
in 1999.

01:00:53.271 --> 01:00:54.941
- No way. - No.

01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:56.441
He's too young.

01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:59.280
- Oh, dear. He's too young. - How much older is he...

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:00.480
- compared to you, SOOBIN? - He's a year older.

01:01:00.481 --> 01:01:01.720
He's just a year older than me.

01:01:01.721 --> 01:01:03.081
Is he?

01:01:04.621 --> 01:01:06.220
(Born in 1999)

01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:07.660
(Shocked)

01:01:07.661 --> 01:01:08.820
No way.

01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:10.191
(Shocked)

01:01:11.261 --> 01:01:12.460
I am 27 years old.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.201
(No way.)

01:01:14.631 --> 01:01:16.000
- He's young. - I am Kim Mu Jin.

01:01:16.001 --> 01:01:18.070
(Kim Mu Jin, born in 1999, 27 years old)

01:01:18.071 --> 01:01:19.231
What's up with the reactions?

01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:23.040
(Mu Jin's age made them dizzy.)

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.447
- Bon Hee is dizzy. - She's surprised.

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:25.971
- Oh, dear. - She's surprised.

01:01:27.181 --> 01:01:28.781
He was younger than I imagined.

01:01:30.281 --> 01:01:33.211
I thought, "He is younger than I thought."

01:01:35.381 --> 01:01:36.520
(Mu Jin is much younger than she imagined.)

01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:39.920
(What is Mu Jin and Bon Hee's age difference?)

01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:43.390
We all know how strong their relationship is.

01:01:43.391 --> 01:01:45.330
Will the age shake them up?

01:01:45.331 --> 01:01:46.491
- It won't. - Will it really?

01:01:46.931 --> 01:01:49.231
It's fine if the age difference is one digit.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:51.871
But if it's over two digits...

01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:53.130
(If the age difference is two digits...)

01:01:53.131 --> 01:01:54.501
If it's 12...

01:01:54.701 --> 01:01:56.640
No, it won't go that far.

01:01:56.641 --> 01:01:58.171
- You think so? - Yes.

01:01:58.711 --> 01:01:59.740
Perhaps ten years?

01:01:59.741 --> 01:02:02.440
- I don't think it will be big. - You think so too, right?

01:02:02.441 --> 01:02:04.250
I think she would be six years older at the most?

01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:05.481
I think so too.

01:02:05.881 --> 01:02:08.651
(It makes us become more curious about Bon Hee's age.)

01:02:09.621 --> 01:02:12.350
(Mu Jin will choose the next person.)

01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:13.761
I choose Ji Yung.

01:02:14.191 --> 01:02:15.391
- Me? - Yes.

01:02:16.021 --> 01:02:18.791
(Ji Yung's age will be revealed.)

01:02:19.491 --> 01:02:21.930
- Ji Yung must be young too. - Ji Yung seems young too.

01:02:21.931 --> 01:02:24.930
(Ji Yung is full of confidence. How old would he be?)

01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:25.931
I was born...

01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:32.771
in 2000.

01:02:34.141 --> 01:02:35.381
- What? - What?

01:02:35.941 --> 01:02:38.080
- What is going on? - No way.

01:02:38.081 --> 01:02:39.210
(Ji Yung is 26 years old.)

01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:40.381
Really?

01:02:41.921 --> 01:02:43.357
- This is crazy. - The same age as SOOBIN.

01:02:43.381 --> 01:02:44.451
I know.

01:02:45.421 --> 01:02:46.650
You two are the same age.

01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:48.391
(Hello, friend.)

01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:50.561
I am Yang Ji Yung, and I am 26 years old.

01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:51.990
I am sorry, Mu Jin.

01:02:51.991 --> 01:02:53.230
He apologized to Mu Jin.

01:02:53.231 --> 01:02:55.301
(Ji Yung's age shocked everyone.)

01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:56.730
- Really? - I am sorry.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:57.870
(Mu Jin is 27 years old, and Ji Yung is 26 years old.)

01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:59.131
- Really? - He's 26 years old?

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.100
That's a plot twist.

01:03:01.101 --> 01:03:03.470
- He was born in 2000? - He was born in 2000?

01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:04.871
He's 26 years old?

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:06.771
He's 26 years old.

01:03:07.841 --> 01:03:10.140
Ji Yung was full of confidence,

01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:11.481
and he was witty.

01:03:11.551 --> 01:03:14.720
I thought he developed that personality...

01:03:14.721 --> 01:03:16.581
through life experience.

01:03:16.851 --> 01:03:20.421
But he was much younger than I imagined. I was surprised.

01:03:22.491 --> 01:03:25.460
I expected him to be the youngest.

01:03:25.461 --> 01:03:27.130
- Right. - It's easy to believe.

01:03:27.131 --> 01:03:28.131
(To someone's eyes, Ji Yung looked like the youngest.)

01:03:28.132 --> 01:03:30.030
- There were times... - He looked like one.

01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:31.430
- when he was like the youngest. - Right.

01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:33.270
- He's very driven. - Right.

01:03:33.271 --> 01:03:35.241
- Full of spirit. - He was full of spirit.

01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:37.571
I'm flustered.

01:03:39.011 --> 01:03:40.170
I choose Yeong Gyeong.

01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:42.381
(Yeong Gyeong's age is revealed.)

01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:44.481
Me?

01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:46.381
Don't look at me with such resentful eyes.

01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:48.621
I am not.

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:51.591
I had to tell you one day.

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:54.361
I am...

01:03:55.091 --> 01:03:58.591
(She's the first older woman to reveal her age.)

01:04:00.561 --> 01:04:05.170
I was born in 1989. I am 37 years old.

01:04:05.171 --> 01:04:06.501
Really?

01:04:06.771 --> 01:04:09.701
- No way. - She looks so young.

01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:12.440
(He immediately speaks formally.)

01:04:12.441 --> 01:04:13.570
- Why did he change? - "She looks so young."

01:04:13.571 --> 01:04:14.841
You have to be respectful.

01:04:15.281 --> 01:04:17.550
(She looks so young.)

01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:19.850
She looks super young.

01:04:19.851 --> 01:04:21.080
(Goodness.)

01:04:21.081 --> 01:04:22.250
I'm really surprised.

01:04:22.251 --> 01:04:24.051
I should study about skin again.

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:26.690
You should. You haven't done enough of it.

01:04:26.691 --> 01:04:27.691
(Embarrassed)

01:04:28.161 --> 01:04:29.621
How old is Hyeon Jun?

01:04:30.221 --> 01:04:32.191
To build the career she has now,

01:04:32.431 --> 01:04:35.761
she must have lived through the time required.

01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.231
I expected her to be around that age.

01:04:41.971 --> 01:04:45.870
I worried that our age difference might be too big.

01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:48.111
I had that worry.

01:04:50.551 --> 01:04:52.280
Hyeon Jun must be young too.

01:04:52.281 --> 01:04:54.821
(Yeong Gyeong is conscious of their age difference.)

01:04:55.351 --> 01:04:58.621
(Hyeon Jun's age is revealed.)

01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:00.051
I...

01:05:01.091 --> 01:05:02.991
You might be surprised to hear this.

01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:09.031
I have a beard, and I am tall.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.171
So I might look older than I am.

01:05:12.631 --> 01:05:14.001
(Gasping)

01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:16.601
Don't tell me he was born in 2002.

01:05:17.141 --> 01:05:18.511
Is he 25 years old?

01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:20.041
Is he 26 years old?

01:05:20.841 --> 01:05:23.410
- Don't lie. - Don't lie.

01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:24.980
Maybe the boys will be more shocked.

01:05:24.981 --> 01:05:26.657
(They make wild guesses about Hyeon Jun's age.)

01:05:26.681 --> 01:05:30.391
I was born in 1996. I am 30 years old.

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:36.620
(Hyeon Jun and Yeong Gyeong are 7 years apart.)

01:05:36.621 --> 01:05:40.191
I think the age difference is neither big nor small.

01:05:40.801 --> 01:05:42.601
I was relieved.

01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:51.241
(It's Sang Won's turn.)

01:05:51.571 --> 01:05:52.571
(Nervous)

01:05:52.572 --> 01:05:53.711
Our dearie, Sang Won.

01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:57.881
(Finally, they will find out Sang Won's age.)

01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:02.181
I was born...

01:06:04.951 --> 01:06:06.821
(Hesitating)

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:12.491
He graduated from the medical school and became a doctor.

01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:16.331
So he might be in his early 30s.

01:06:17.371 --> 01:06:20.401
(Is Sang Won in his early 30s, like Ye Eun predicted?)

01:06:21.771 --> 01:06:25.271
What if he's much younger than the age I expected?

01:06:26.671 --> 01:06:30.041
(Attention is focused on him.)

01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:31.851
I...

01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:35.121
was born...

01:06:37.621 --> 01:06:38.851
in 1999.

01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:40.660
I am 27 years old.

01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:41.661
(Park Sang Won, born in 1999, 27 years old)

01:06:41.662 --> 01:06:44.430
(He's in his 20s?)

01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:46.891
(Is this right?)

01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:48.401
No way.

01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:53.330
What will they do?

01:06:53.331 --> 01:06:54.400
(She's worried.)

01:06:54.401 --> 01:06:56.071
He's a lot younger than I thought.

01:06:56.241 --> 01:06:58.471
The two ladies must be very shocked.

01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:01.940
I was born in 1999.

01:07:01.941 --> 01:07:04.681
(Park Sang Won, born in 1999, 27 years old)

01:07:04.881 --> 01:07:07.011
(Gasping)

01:07:08.521 --> 01:07:09.681
I am 27 years old.

01:07:10.081 --> 01:07:11.450
(Shocked)

01:07:11.451 --> 01:07:12.790
Look at the ladies' faces.

01:07:12.791 --> 01:07:14.891
(Goodness)

01:07:14.991 --> 01:07:16.121
This is so fun.

01:07:17.431 --> 01:07:20.461
I'm surprised. I thought he would be older.

01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:22.861
I look old. I am sorry.

01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:26.200
(My goodness)

01:07:26.201 --> 01:07:27.900
(Goodness)

01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:30.341
He's younger than I thought.

01:07:30.811 --> 01:07:32.541
She's flustered.

01:07:33.141 --> 01:07:35.181
I was surprised.

01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:37.881
He was younger than I imagined.

01:07:39.081 --> 01:07:41.780
- He's so young. - The doctor is in his 20s.

01:07:41.781 --> 01:07:43.461
(Sang Won was younger than they expected.)

01:07:43.921 --> 01:07:46.491
(Who's next?)

01:07:46.651 --> 01:07:48.091
(Well...)

01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:50.461
(Looking away)

01:07:50.591 --> 01:07:52.131
(Looking)

01:07:52.561 --> 01:07:53.591
Ye Eun?

01:07:54.531 --> 01:07:58.371
(Sang Won chose Ye Eun.)

01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:02.940
Ye Eun was the one who expressed interest in me,

01:08:02.941 --> 01:08:04.071
so I wanted to know her age.

01:08:05.471 --> 01:08:08.040
(Ye Eun's age is revealed.)

01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.081
I...

01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:11.481
This is nerve-racking.

01:08:14.181 --> 01:08:15.650
Oh, dear.

01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:16.651
(Hesitating)

01:08:16.652 --> 01:08:17.721
I was...

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:20.721
born in...

01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:32.971
1989.

01:08:33.331 --> 01:08:35.400
I am 37 years old.

01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:37.071
(Park Ye Eun, born in 1989, 37 years old)

01:08:37.811 --> 01:08:39.310
(Ye Eun and Sang Won are 10 years apart.)

01:08:39.311 --> 01:08:41.410
- Then, they're ten years apart. - Yes.

01:08:41.411 --> 01:08:44.180
I thought you'd be much younger than me.

01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:46.080
- Let's be friends. - It's nice to meet you, friend.

01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:47.981
(Roommates and friends who are the same age)

01:08:48.421 --> 01:08:51.190
- That's amazing. Seriously. - Gosh, really...

01:08:51.191 --> 01:08:53.691
Goodness, I really can't predict anyone's ages.

01:08:53.791 --> 01:08:55.020
Gosh, hang on.

01:08:55.021 --> 01:08:56.561
(Shutting his eyes tight)

01:08:56.621 --> 01:08:59.461
(Ye Eun's age surprised everyone.)

01:09:00.361 --> 01:09:03.801
(Now, it's Ye Eun's turn to choose someone.)

01:09:05.201 --> 01:09:06.531
I choose...

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:09.471
Ji Won.

01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:11.641
- Ji Won. - Ji Won.

01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:12.911
Me?

01:09:13.711 --> 01:09:14.711
I...

01:09:14.712 --> 01:09:15.840
(How old is Ji Won?)

01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:16.841
I...

01:09:16.842 --> 01:09:19.051
(How old is Ji Won?)

01:09:23.851 --> 01:09:24.851
I...

01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:28.561
was born in 1990...

01:09:29.361 --> 01:09:31.461
She was born in the 1990s.

01:09:32.161 --> 01:09:33.930
- He looks happy. - He's happy right now.

01:09:33.931 --> 01:09:36.331
- Sang Won looks happy. - His facial expression seems happy.

01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:41.801
Born in 1990.

01:09:41.901 --> 01:09:43.940
I'm 36-year-old Park Ji Won.

01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:46.341
(Park Ji Won, born in 1990, 36 years old)

01:09:46.571 --> 01:09:48.410
I'm 36-year-old Park Ji Won.

01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:50.411
They're still nine years apart.

01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:53.981
(Ye Eun is a year older than Ji Won.)

01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:56.180
You might be the youngest woman here.

01:09:56.181 --> 01:09:58.820
- Am I the youngest? - So far, you're the youngest.

01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:00.351
(Is Ji Won the youngest of the women?)

01:10:00.991 --> 01:10:03.191
Honestly, I expected that they might be...

01:10:03.661 --> 01:10:05.430
a few years older than me, but I was still a bit shocked.

01:10:05.431 --> 01:10:08.731
I thought, "Really? I was really mistaken."

01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:14.101
I don't think a year's difference is that important.

01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:18.711
(After learning each other's ages, will these three feel the same way?)

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:21.010
(This time, it's Bon Hee's turn.)

01:10:21.011 --> 01:10:22.731
- Gosh, I feel... - Oh, gosh. It's Bon Hee.

01:10:24.781 --> 01:10:26.581
(Glancing around)

01:10:27.211 --> 01:10:28.881
(Glancing back)

01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:36.121
I am...

01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:41.230
(Buddy Buddy)

01:10:41.231 --> 01:10:43.100
(Cyworld?)

01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:46.330
(Mu Jin expected that their age gap would be pretty big.)

01:10:46.331 --> 01:10:48.701
When I actually hear about her age,

01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:51.011
how I might feel was a bit...

01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:54.511
of a concern for me.

01:10:55.441 --> 01:10:57.240
- You don't like me saying "noona?" - Oh, no.

01:10:57.241 --> 01:10:58.641
(You don't like me saying "noona?")

01:10:59.381 --> 01:11:02.381
(I like being called by my name the most.)

01:11:03.281 --> 01:11:04.690
(Then, I'll call you Bon Hee.)

01:11:04.691 --> 01:11:06.451
(Okay.)

01:11:07.561 --> 01:11:09.320
No, she doesn't look that old.

01:11:09.321 --> 01:11:13.591
For the first time, Mu Jin called me "noona."

01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:15.231
At the time, I felt...

01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:19.431
It felt real for the first time.

01:11:20.031 --> 01:11:22.641
"Will we really be okay when we learn each other's age?"

01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:25.771
I still think that way.

01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:29.110
How old is she?

01:11:29.111 --> 01:11:30.140
(She had forgotten about their age gap for a little while.)

01:11:30.141 --> 01:11:31.650
- I keep holding my breath. - I really don't know.

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:32.651
What do we do?

01:11:35.721 --> 01:11:36.721
I...

01:11:37.521 --> 01:11:39.051
(Hesitating)

01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:41.261
Was born in 19...

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:47.730
In 1987. I am 39 years old.

01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:49.100
(Gu Bon Hee, born in 1987, 39 years old)

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:50.700
I am 39 years old.

01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:52.630
(Nodding)

01:11:52.631 --> 01:11:54.540
- Wait a minute! - They're 12 years apart.

01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:55.541
- They're 12 years apart. - They're 12 years apart.
- They really are. - They're 12 years apart.

01:11:56.542 --> 01:11:58.270
Oh, no!

01:11:58.271 --> 01:12:00.610
- This couple is 12 years apart? - These guys are 12 years apart?

01:12:00.611 --> 01:12:01.940
I thought they might be.

01:12:01.941 --> 01:12:04.010
Gosh, they're 12 years apart. What do we do?

01:12:04.011 --> 01:12:05.780
Then, even compared to her own younger brother,

01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:07.697
- He's a year younger. - he's still a year younger.

01:12:07.721 --> 01:12:10.821
- What do we do about this? - I mean... What do we do?

01:12:11.321 --> 01:12:13.150
This will have quite an effect.

01:12:13.151 --> 01:12:14.360
It's understandable that Bon Hee is shocked.

01:12:14.361 --> 01:12:15.361
Of course.

01:12:15.362 --> 01:12:16.642
Earlier, Bon Hee went like this.

01:12:16.961 --> 01:12:18.090
(Bon Hee was physically taken aback.)

01:12:18.091 --> 01:12:19.091
Seriously...

01:12:19.861 --> 01:12:20.861
That's what she did.

01:12:21.431 --> 01:12:22.711
Right, she must've been shocked.

01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:24.771
Oh, no.

01:12:26.231 --> 01:12:29.170
I was born in 1987. I am 39 years old.

01:12:29.171 --> 01:12:30.577
(Gu Bon Hee, born in 1987, 39 years old)

01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:32.140
I am 39 years old.

01:12:32.141 --> 01:12:34.041
(Nodding)

01:12:37.281 --> 01:12:40.110
- Gosh, that makes no sense. - She looks so young.

01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:41.471
How does she have such great skin?

01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:43.351
What? Why does everyone look so young?

01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:45.791
Ji Won, were you really surprised?

01:12:46.421 --> 01:12:48.591
(Nodding)

01:12:49.121 --> 01:12:52.991
(And Mu Jin just quietly nods.)

01:12:53.561 --> 01:12:55.501
Honestly, I had expected it to a certain degree.

01:12:56.431 --> 01:13:00.030
I had thought that we might be...

01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:01.177
about ten years apart, but...

01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:02.201
What do we do?

01:13:02.301 --> 01:13:03.770
(Born in 1999)

01:13:03.771 --> 01:13:05.171
(and in 1987)

01:13:05.471 --> 01:13:09.011
(They have a 12-year age gap.)

01:13:09.441 --> 01:13:10.511
Twelve years apart...

01:13:11.811 --> 01:13:16.421
I think I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned.

01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:20.651
Honestly, I was a little surprised. I was surprised,

01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:23.161
but Bon Hee must've been quite shocked too.

01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:29.630
My gut feeling told me there might be those who are 12 years younger,

01:13:29.631 --> 01:13:31.230
but I didn't think that it would be Mu Jin.

01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:32.300
This is seriously...

01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:35.901
When I think about if we were to date,

01:13:36.301 --> 01:13:39.371
it makes me worry because I've never done this before.

01:13:41.141 --> 01:13:46.081
(They didn't expect their 12-year age gap.)

01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:49.320
Oh, no.

01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:50.520
(After learning about each other's age)

01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:51.821
This is so confusing.

01:13:52.421 --> 01:13:53.550
I feel so confused.

01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:54.951
(Will they have a change of heart?)

01:13:55.361 --> 01:13:56.821
What will happen now?

01:13:57.591 --> 01:13:59.831
I don't think Mu Jin will be able to hold them together.

01:13:59.931 --> 01:14:01.260
- It won't be easy. - I think he will.

01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:02.977
- Mu Jin? - Mu Jin might hold them together.

01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:05.070
I think Bon Hee might back off a lot.

01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:07.531
- Totally. - I think Mu Jin will hold onto her.

01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:11.241
Sang Hyeon?

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:14.041
(Revealing Sang Hyeon's age)

01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:16.780
- I think he'll be young. - He will be young.

01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:18.281
This is total chaos, literally.

01:14:18.651 --> 01:14:22.820
Oh, I'm older than I thought.

01:14:22.821 --> 01:14:24.851
Oh, he's in his 30s.

01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:29.361
(I've usually dated women who are younger or the same age as me.)

01:14:30.621 --> 01:14:34.701
(I feel like I'm taking on a challenge.)

01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:39.131
(Do you find me too cute?)

01:14:39.231 --> 01:14:41.200
(Do I seem like a kid to you?)

01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:42.700
(Yes, you're kind of adorable.)

01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:44.441
(That is true.)

01:14:45.211 --> 01:14:50.911
(Sang Hyeon didn't want to seem just like a younger man.)

01:14:51.011 --> 01:14:52.480
(Also, I thought about this too.)

01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:55.150
(After hearing about our age...)

01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:56.620
(Mu Jin, if you are...)

01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:58.650
(a lot younger than me, )

01:14:58.651 --> 01:15:01.051
(that means you have a bigger age gap with Bon Hee than me.)

01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:03.290
(Could a rift develop between Bon Hee and Mu Jin?)

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:04.560
(I did have that thought.)

01:15:04.561 --> 01:15:05.890
He's looking at it as a competitive edge.

01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:08.561
I'm older than I thought.

01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:10.101
Oh, really?

01:15:10.501 --> 01:15:12.971
Don't you think he seems rather happy?

01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:17.041
(Will Sang Hyeon be older than Mu Jin?)

01:15:17.911 --> 01:15:20.071
I was born in 19...

01:15:24.481 --> 01:15:29.221
In 1997.

01:15:30.121 --> 01:15:32.550
(Kim Sang Hyeon, born in 1997, 29 years old)

01:15:32.551 --> 01:15:34.420
I am 29 years old.

01:15:34.421 --> 01:15:37.220
(Sang Hyeon is 2 years older than Mu Jin, )

01:15:37.221 --> 01:15:40.591
(and he's 10 years younger than Bon Hee.)

01:15:44.601 --> 01:15:46.400
Hearing that he was born in 1997,

01:15:46.401 --> 01:15:48.771
I thought, "That makes sense."

01:15:49.201 --> 01:15:50.700
I wasn't too surprised.

01:15:50.701 --> 01:15:53.871
(So Hyun had somewhat expected Sang Hyeon's age.)

01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:56.440
So Hyun.

01:15:56.441 --> 01:15:59.010
(Now, lastly, So Hyun's age is revealed.)

01:15:59.011 --> 01:16:00.011
I...

01:16:00.012 --> 01:16:02.221
(Now, lastly, So Hyun's age is revealed.)

01:16:03.081 --> 01:16:08.221
(The younger men all focus on her.)

01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:12.061
I was born in 19...

01:16:13.961 --> 01:16:15.201
About 2 or 3 years?

01:16:15.301 --> 01:16:17.771
Or maybe about 3 or 4 years older?

01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:21.041
I...

01:16:22.841 --> 01:16:23.870
(How old is So Hyun?)

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:25.971
I was born in 19...

01:16:28.681 --> 01:16:31.350
I was born in 1990.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:33.810
That makes me 36? Yes.

01:16:33.811 --> 01:16:35.327
(Go So Hyun, born in 1990, 36 years old)

01:16:35.351 --> 01:16:36.351
You two are friends.

01:16:36.352 --> 01:16:39.421
(Along with Ji Won, they're the youngest among the women.)

01:16:41.061 --> 01:16:42.590
- Oh, my! He's smiling. - After hearing her age...

01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:44.560
What do you think that smile means?

01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:45.830
(Ji Yung and So Hyun are 10 years apart.)

01:16:45.831 --> 01:16:46.831
How cute.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:52.571
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon, who is 7 years younger, looks frozen.)

01:16:54.441 --> 01:16:57.341
I was curious how old So Hyun was,

01:16:57.441 --> 01:17:00.771
but once I heard, I was actually quite worried.

01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:04.080
I think that was why I couldn't hide my emotions.

01:17:04.081 --> 01:17:07.380
Oh, a seven-year age gap must seem like a burden.

01:17:07.381 --> 01:17:09.820
I guess so. She might be older than he thought.

01:17:09.821 --> 01:17:11.950
He thought they'd be only 2 or 3 years apart.

01:17:11.951 --> 01:17:14.631
(Sang Hyeon seems to have a lot on his mind after hearing her age.)

01:17:18.591 --> 01:17:21.431
(Sang Hyeon can't meet So Hyun's eyes.)

01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:25.531
"After hearing about my age, he has a lot on his mind."

01:17:26.501 --> 01:17:29.300
I wanted to look into his eyes and stuff,

01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:33.111
but he wouldn't even smile when our eyes met and avoided me.

01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.880
"Am I too old for him?"

01:17:35.881 --> 01:17:38.381
I had those guesses by myself.

01:17:38.481 --> 01:17:39.911
Right, she could feel that way.

01:17:40.451 --> 01:17:45.021
(So Hyun is curious about Sang Hyeon's thoughts.)

01:17:46.751 --> 01:17:48.191
(Sighing)

01:17:48.921 --> 01:17:51.231
Has anyone changed their minds?

01:17:52.861 --> 01:17:54.331
Anyone? I'm curious.

01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:56.841
She'd be curious about Sang Hyeon, right?

01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:05.970
(What kind of effect will age...)

01:18:05.971 --> 01:18:09.610
(have on their relationships?)

01:18:09.611 --> 01:18:11.681
Bon Hee looks so concerned.

01:18:12.211 --> 01:18:15.351
Whose heart has been shaken up?

01:18:18.821 --> 01:18:21.860
(The mood seems subtly mysterious after the age reveal.)

01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:24.931
"After hearing about my age, he has a lot on his mind."

01:18:26.761 --> 01:18:28.901
(I think it did weigh heavily on my mind.)

01:18:29.361 --> 01:18:31.531
(I've just faced reality.)

01:18:31.931 --> 01:18:33.530
(As of now, I only have you...)

01:18:33.531 --> 01:18:34.971
(here.)

01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:38.910
(I was...)

01:18:38.911 --> 01:18:40.710
(totally out of my mind earlier.)

01:18:40.711 --> 01:18:42.041
(Because Sang Won is younger?)

01:18:43.081 --> 01:18:45.881
(I thought my relationship with Ye Eun was over.)

01:18:46.681 --> 01:18:48.421
(Go to the person you're drawn to.)

01:18:48.851 --> 01:18:50.691
(A night of confusion has come to Yeon House.)

01:18:51.691 --> 01:18:53.921
(I'll get on my knees first and say this.)

01:18:54.791 --> 01:18:58.190
(I smiled in front of you and all that.)

01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:00.191
(Would that all be fake?)

01:19:01.701 --> 01:19:04.021
(While listening, So Hyun quietly goes into the bathroom.)

01:19:04.931 --> 01:19:08.871
(I can't believe this.)

01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:11.411
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin begin talking seriously.)

01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:15.140
(It's such a huge age gap.)

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.751
(If we're over 10 years apart...)

01:19:19.611 --> 01:19:24.951
(Bon Hee's heart has started to waver after the age reveal.)

01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:26.651
(Sighing)

01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:30.391
(This is driving me crazy.)

01:19:35.701 --> 01:19:38.471
(Today, So Hyun has a special date.)

01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:42.070
(Which younger man is making So Hyun laugh?)

01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:44.941
(Mu Jin)

01:19:45.671 --> 01:19:47.270
(If I had moved in on the same day, )

01:19:47.271 --> 01:19:49.141
(would things have been different for us?)

01:19:51.711 --> 01:19:54.251
(I think that could've been true.)
