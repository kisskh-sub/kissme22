00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:11.825
VIETNAM, 1965

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.471
Column, halt.

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:46.109
It doesn't really matter
what the war is for.

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:56.453
Someone's death becomes
someone else's chance.

00:00:57.913 --> 00:00:59.122
That's what war is.

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:21.645
Looks like one of the Vietcong tunnels.

00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:45.836
Moving in.

00:02:20.078 --> 00:02:23.582
And my role was to be that death.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.753
Just cannon fodder
for someone else's rise.

00:03:26.228 --> 00:03:28.688
- How did it go?
- It's been taken care of, sir.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.191
And the money in the safe?

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:33.026
Baek will take it to you.

00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:36.363
Clean it up right. No loose ends.

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:37.531
Yes, sir. Understood.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:57.676
It's done. (Support Admin Watch on

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.060
Mr. Jang!

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.356
Man, what the hell happened here?

00:04:12.232 --> 00:04:14.901
Mr. Jang, are you all right? Are you hurt?

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:20.115
-Baek Kitae didn't show, right?
-No, he never got off the ship.

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.538
Well, let's start by tracking down
Pyo Haksu first.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.958
We were just about to call in backup
from the nearby army base.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:34.129
Search request,
KCIA Agent Pyo Haksu.

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:36.882
- He showed up on his own.
- You can't come in here!

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:39.009
Move, asshole. I'm with the KCIA.

00:04:39.092 --> 00:04:41.344
- Hey! Let him through.
- I said, move!

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:45.140
Mr. Pyo Haksu!

00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:49.895
Come here, please.

00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:52.397
How do you know who I am?

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.108
What's going on here?

00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.611
I'm Busan District Prosecutor
Jang Geonyoung.

00:04:58.278 --> 00:04:59.279
Okay. And?

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.490
What brings the KCIA department head here?

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:04.826
I came to pick up the director.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.662
- Director Hwang?
- Yes, where is he?

00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:08.955
Well, you killed him.

00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:11.958
You're under arrest

00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:15.545
for suspicion of Director General
Hwang Gukpyeong's murder.

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:17.297
Cuff him.

00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:19.466
Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:20.926
- Hey, wait.
- Don't make a scene.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:22.177
-Just hold on.
-Come on.

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:25.013
No, stop! I'll do it myself.

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.853
You sure you can handle this?
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:33.521
Quiet down. Let's go.

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.858
WAR OF BLOOD

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.283
Mr. Baek, you're here.

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:49.079
What's going on?

00:05:49.162 --> 00:05:50.580
Prosecutors arrested Mr. Pyo

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:52.832
under suspicion
of murdering Director Hwang.

00:05:52.916 --> 00:05:56.711
We're waiting on the autopsy to confirm
the body's really Director Hwang.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:05:58.672
Silence the press first.

00:05:58.755 --> 00:05:59.756
Yes, sir.

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:03.551
Wait, sir. There's blood on your…

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.685
I'm heading up to Seoul.
Get the car ready.

00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:13.019
Yes, sir.

00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:04.904
Hello?

00:07:04.988 --> 00:07:07.157
- Hey, Soyeong.
- Hi, Kitae.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.659
- Where's Daeil now?
- Mr. Daeil?

00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:12.912
He was at the lab
but left to take care of something.

00:07:13.413 --> 00:07:14.456
Why do you ask?

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.084
-Is something wrong?
-Got it. I have to go.

00:07:21.337 --> 00:07:22.338
Who was that?

00:07:23.715 --> 00:07:25.341
It's Kitae. He's looking for you.

00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:28.052
What for?

00:07:30.597 --> 00:07:31.806
I have no idea.

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:35.685
Mr. Pyo Haksu.

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:39.272
Why did you kill him?

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:41.107
Why did you kill Hwang?

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:42.984
You keep crossing the line.

00:07:43.651 --> 00:07:45.528
If you keep bulldozing ahead like that,

00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:47.947
how will you handle
the consequences later?

00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:49.324
Just worried about you.

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:53.620
You killed him. Didn't you?

00:07:55.038 --> 00:07:56.039
Did you see it?

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:59.459
I saw him dead, shot through the eye.

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:02.378
I told you. I dropped him off
and went to buy cigarettes.

00:08:02.462 --> 00:08:04.881
Go ask at the store.
How many times do I have to…

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:11.179
So you're saying,
while you were out buying cigarettes,

00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:14.390
Hwang ended up dead?

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:16.476
What then?

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:19.229
You think I killed him

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:21.773
and then went out for cigarettes?

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:24.484
And the fire just happened to break out?

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:26.903
Come on, Mr. Jang. That doesn't add up.

00:08:26.986 --> 00:08:29.447
And what motive could I have to kill him?

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:31.783
There's no motive.

00:08:32.492 --> 00:08:33.493
Right.

00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:39.958
You went to buy cigarettes,
Hwang died, and the fire broke out.

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.377
Baek Kitae was with you, wasn't he?

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:47.674
He was with you at the temple, right?

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:30.800
Here it is.

00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:32.677
Look, that's Ikeda Yuji.

00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:35.555
Tell me, what was the KCIA

00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:38.433
doing with the yakuza in Osaka?

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.395
That's classified. I can't tell you.

00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:44.647
Classified, my fucking ass.

00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:46.024
Watch your language.

00:09:46.107 --> 00:09:48.359
I know you and Baek Kitae went to Japan

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:50.361
and sold meth there.

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:53.364
Then, you passed the money to Hwang.

00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:57.327
You did all the work,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.287
but the bastard reaped the cash.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.000
That's why you and Baek Kitae
killed him, isn't it?

00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:08.254
Do you have proof? Do you?

00:10:08.338 --> 00:10:11.299
Proof? Sure.
I'll whip up a good one for you.

00:10:11.382 --> 00:10:13.134
- Wow.
- You little…

00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:14.302
You do that.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:15.386
Hey.

00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:18.431
You like prison food? Huh?

00:10:22.936 --> 00:10:24.395
- Jang.
- Yes?

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:25.813
A word?

00:10:25.897 --> 00:10:27.774
Goodness! What is it?

00:10:27.857 --> 00:10:29.234
You should go.

00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:33.029
- Looks like you're in trouble. Go on.
- Have a smoke while I'm gone.

00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:48.962
Geez.

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:54.842
BUSAN DISTRICT
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE CASE RECORDS

00:10:57.262 --> 00:10:58.846
So, Baek Kitae took over

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:01.474
Jo Manjae's meth business?

00:11:02.225 --> 00:11:03.226
Yes, sir.

00:11:03.309 --> 00:11:05.561
With Kang Daeil backing him?

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:06.646
That's right.

00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:10.400
And they killed Director Hwang?

00:11:10.984 --> 00:11:12.610
He had a gunshot wound

00:11:13.778 --> 00:11:14.988
to the face,

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.865
through the right eye.

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:20.618
They shot him dead.

00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:23.538
And set the place on fire

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:25.415
to wipe out the evidence.

00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:29.919
Sir.

00:11:30.503 --> 00:11:31.504
I'm going to

00:11:32.046 --> 00:11:33.881
issue an arrest warrant for Baek Kitae.

00:11:33.965 --> 00:11:35.300
If this goes wrong,

00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.011
the whole prosecution blows up.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.971
You realize that?

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:42.473
-Yes.
-Fucking hell.

00:11:43.016 --> 00:11:46.060
I'll make sure we get Pyo's confession.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.483
This is the money

00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:55.028
Director Hwang had been skimming off
behind your back.

00:11:57.447 --> 00:12:00.825
Looks like his head wasn't the only thing
he was thinning out.

00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:04.912
I believe he also had some land
and buildings in his relatives' names.

00:12:04.996 --> 00:12:07.373
I'll check and report back
as soon as I can.

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:11.753
And this.

00:12:27.018 --> 00:12:28.686
It's Bae Geumji's notebook.

00:12:35.485 --> 00:12:36.486
Did you look?

00:12:36.986 --> 00:12:37.987
Yes, sir.

00:12:38.571 --> 00:12:39.822
I did.

00:12:42.033 --> 00:12:43.034
And you saw my name?

00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:44.744
I'm sorry, sir.

00:12:56.506 --> 00:12:57.840
What do you want?

00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:02.595
I came to ask you
to please reinvest this money with me.

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:07.975
If you'd let me,
I'm sure I can use this as seed money

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:10.269
and multiply the returns
by many times over.

00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:12.605
So you're saying,

00:13:13.773 --> 00:13:15.400
you want to do business with me?

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.652
The election is less than a year away.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:19.654
I heard the President needs 70 billion won

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:22.156
to secure another term
for the good of the nation.

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:24.951
I'll raise it.

00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:27.995
How can I trust you?

00:13:28.079 --> 00:13:29.455
You don't have to trust me.

00:13:29.539 --> 00:13:32.166
Just give me a chance
to prove what I can do.

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:36.295
I'll show you that even if you don't
trust me, you can trust my money.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.340
I won't let you down, sir.

00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:00.820
Go sit in that chair.

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:11.622
Go sit in it.

00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:32.768
I heard Hwang went around
telling everyone

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.562
you were his pick for the next director,

00:14:34.645 --> 00:14:37.481
and he took good care of you.

00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.990
And that made a lot of people jealous.

00:14:51.454 --> 00:14:52.455
Now that…

00:14:54.373 --> 00:14:56.167
he's dead…

00:14:58.294 --> 00:15:00.421
shouldn't you be
the one to take his place?

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:05.551
Come to think of it,

00:15:06.135 --> 00:15:07.720
it's not all bad

00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:11.307
for Baek Kitae that you're stuck in here.

00:15:12.225 --> 00:15:14.560
Someone definitely murdered Hwang

00:15:14.644 --> 00:15:16.437
with a gun and burned down the place…

00:15:19.398 --> 00:15:21.150
but you were out buying cigarettes.

00:15:25.196 --> 00:15:27.073
Do you trust Baek Kitae?

00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:31.744
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with him,

00:15:31.827 --> 00:15:33.371
but think carefully.

00:15:35.248 --> 00:15:37.833
You and I both know

00:15:38.793 --> 00:15:40.169
who killed Hwang.

00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:50.554
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:51.847
STATEMENT

00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:54.100
That day,

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:56.894
who else

00:15:58.187 --> 00:15:59.647
was at that temple…

00:16:03.401 --> 00:16:05.027
besides Hwang?

00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:06.320
I want you to write down

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:09.448
the truth.

00:16:12.368 --> 00:16:14.370
Do you want to rot in prison?

00:16:22.753 --> 00:16:25.840
Baek Kitae becomes director general,

00:16:27.174 --> 00:16:30.177
and you go to prison.

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:38.853
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:39.979
Damn it.

00:16:40.062 --> 00:16:41.355
What's going on?

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:45.192
The deputy chief prosecutor ordered
the release of Pyo Haksu.

00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:47.320
Please come with us, Mr. Pyo.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:02.668
God, my legs…

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:10.843
Mr. Seo!

00:17:11.927 --> 00:17:13.012
Mr. Seo!

00:17:13.596 --> 00:17:16.307
How can the prosecution hand over
its investigative authority?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.641
To the suspects, no less!

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:19.894
Who says you can do that?

00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:22.063
Hey!

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:27.360
Get back inside.

00:17:27.443 --> 00:17:29.153
You too. Get back inside.

00:17:29.236 --> 00:17:32.657
DEPUTY CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR SEO GIHO

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.908
What about you?

00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:36.369
Who says they're suspects?
You have no evidence.

00:17:37.078 --> 00:17:39.538
You said you didn't see Baek Kitae there.

00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:41.540
I'll arrest him on meth charges first.

00:17:42.583 --> 00:17:46.420
I'll get Kang Daeil to talk,
charge Baek with drug offenses,

00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:50.049
and then prove the murder!

00:17:50.132 --> 00:17:52.051
Now's the time to keep your head down.

00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:53.928
They've even stripped our authority.

00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:57.598
You've got to hold on to your job
if you want another chance later.

00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:02.395
That bastard
killed his own boss just to push meth!

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:04.105
All right?

00:18:04.188 --> 00:18:07.650
You know if we don't get him now,
he'll become too big to catch!

00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:11.737
The order came from much higher up.

00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.156
You understand what I'm saying?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.701
Well, who the hell is this higher-up?

00:18:19.453 --> 00:18:21.122
Just watch your back for a while.

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:27.128
THE BLUE HOUSE
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

00:18:36.053 --> 00:18:40.141
Na's really getting under
Cheon's skin today, huh?

00:18:40.224 --> 00:18:41.392
Tell me about it.

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:43.686
The President favors
Cheon of the Security Service

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:45.688
over the secretariat these days, so…

00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:51.694
Mr. Na.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.740
Why do you keep stirring up
something that's already settled?

00:18:55.823 --> 00:18:57.199
Didn't you hear me?

00:18:57.283 --> 00:18:58.659
It was the President's orders.

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:00.745
That's what you always say.

00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:04.081
It's getting hard to believe.

00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:07.460
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and check with him yourself.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.924
Still, I serve him the same way you do,
so how could you do that without a word--

00:19:14.008 --> 00:19:17.762
Did you ask me
before getting rid of Bae Geumji?

00:19:19.513 --> 00:19:21.891
You've got to be joking.

00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.853
- Bae Geumji? Me?
- Anyway…

00:19:26.437 --> 00:19:29.231
Keep tossing people out for no reason,

00:19:29.315 --> 00:19:31.776
and you might be the next one to go.

00:19:32.777 --> 00:19:33.778
All right?

00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:38.616
You know, I'm just saying this
for your own good.

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:41.035
Right, of course.

00:19:43.078 --> 00:19:45.706
Since you're so concerned,
I'll bear that in mind.

00:19:47.082 --> 00:19:48.083
Oh, right.

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:50.711
I heard you lost one of your subordinates.

00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:52.755
You must be devastated.

00:19:53.464 --> 00:19:54.924
Perhaps, it's a sign

00:19:55.633 --> 00:19:58.552
you should watch your back too, Mr. Cheon.

00:20:04.975 --> 00:20:08.354
Yeah,
you should always be careful too.

00:20:09.939 --> 00:20:11.899
Take care of yourself.

00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:17.196
As you know, I don't ask anyone…

00:20:19.949 --> 00:20:21.700
before I get rid of someone.

00:20:25.454 --> 00:20:27.581
It looks like there's a leak.

00:20:28.374 --> 00:20:29.875
Any idea who?

00:20:32.294 --> 00:20:35.089
Jang Geonyoung knew we went to Japan.

00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:37.424
And what we went there for.

00:20:39.802 --> 00:20:41.053
So what did you tell him?

00:20:41.136 --> 00:20:43.514
Well, what else?
I said it was classified.

00:20:45.766 --> 00:20:47.142
Did he say anything else?

00:20:47.226 --> 00:20:49.603
He was sure you're the one
who killed Hwang.

00:20:56.277 --> 00:20:58.028
How did your meeting with Cheon go?

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:04.869
How much…

00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:08.372
did you tell Cheon?

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.207
What do you mean?

00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.751
He looked like he knew everything.

00:21:13.252 --> 00:21:15.796
I didn't tell him you killed Hwang.

00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:19.091
Like we agreed,

00:21:19.717 --> 00:21:22.011
I just said he died in a fire.

00:21:22.845 --> 00:21:24.680
Which is true. He did die in a fire.

00:21:26.974 --> 00:21:28.058
Well, doesn't matter.

00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.603
He didn't really seem to care.

00:21:31.312 --> 00:21:32.313
Yeah?

00:21:33.063 --> 00:21:34.940
But how did Jang Geonyoung know?

00:21:40.112 --> 00:21:41.655
We got a rat or what?

00:21:56.086 --> 00:21:57.254
Did you find Baek Kitae?

00:21:58.088 --> 00:21:59.590
He's nowhere to be found.

00:21:59.673 --> 00:22:01.216
He hasn't been home,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.761
and the KCIA's keeping their mouths shut.

00:22:05.721 --> 00:22:07.139
What about the scene?

00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:09.099
All we found were some bullet casings.

00:22:09.183 --> 00:22:10.851
Everything burned to a crisp.

00:22:10.935 --> 00:22:12.186
There's no evidence left.

00:22:15.564 --> 00:22:19.151
But, sir, is it really
okay for us to keep doing this here…

00:22:19.234 --> 00:22:23.280
I mean, there's nothing left to dig into,

00:22:23.364 --> 00:22:25.783
and if the deputy chief finds out,
he'll rip into us.

00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:27.117
What about Kang Daeil?

00:22:27.618 --> 00:22:29.536
Any word from him?

00:22:37.795 --> 00:22:42.007
When are the materials
from Japan getting here?

00:22:42.508 --> 00:22:44.843
We'll never make quota with what's left.

00:22:46.053 --> 00:22:47.137
Ms. Baek.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.847
Come on, take a break.

00:22:49.473 --> 00:22:50.474
All right.

00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:00.734
Hope this tastes okay.

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:04.989
Thank you.

00:23:10.995 --> 00:23:11.996
Mmm…

00:23:12.955 --> 00:23:14.123
- It's good.
- Wait.

00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:17.584
How are you so beautiful?

00:23:19.169 --> 00:23:20.337
Oh, please!

00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:21.463
Come on, stop.

00:23:34.893 --> 00:23:37.604
Any word from your brother?

00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:39.189
Who cares?

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.693
He made one lousy call
and hasn't shown his face since.

00:23:47.031 --> 00:23:49.324
What's that? Didn't you say
no one else was here?

00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:51.618
Who'd be here this late?

00:23:54.455 --> 00:23:56.123
Sir.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:00.711
Hi, Kitae.

00:24:01.962 --> 00:24:03.213
God, speak of the devil.

00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:05.174
Anyway, Kitae.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.176
What are you doing here?

00:24:08.218 --> 00:24:10.304
What are you two
doing here alone? It's late.

00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:12.222
I had to finish up the books.

00:24:13.182 --> 00:24:14.183
Kitae.

00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:16.477
Gosh, this isn't what it looks like.

00:24:18.604 --> 00:24:19.855
Yeah.

00:24:19.938 --> 00:24:21.356
Soyeong, give us the room.

00:24:21.982 --> 00:24:24.276
- Why?
- I need to talk to Daeil.

00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:27.362
Okay.

00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:37.831
You said you were going to Japan,
but I didn't hear from you

00:24:37.915 --> 00:24:39.333
so I was worried.

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.959
Everything okay while I was gone?

00:24:41.043 --> 00:24:42.878
Of course, sir. Everything was fine.

00:24:44.004 --> 00:24:46.340
So, you need to talk to me
about something?

00:24:50.302 --> 00:24:51.303
Have a seat.

00:24:52.638 --> 00:24:53.639
Okay.

00:25:03.398 --> 00:25:04.399
Daeil.

00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:08.904
What do you think is the most basic virtue
a person should have?

00:25:10.531 --> 00:25:12.282
I've never really thought about it.

00:25:13.158 --> 00:25:14.660
Then think about it now.

00:25:17.788 --> 00:25:19.039
Loyalty?

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.125
Sure, loyalty's important.

00:25:22.126 --> 00:25:23.418
But you know what I think?

00:25:23.919 --> 00:25:25.003
I think it's shame.

00:25:25.921 --> 00:25:26.922
Shame?

00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:30.092
The people I hate most are
the shameless ones.

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:33.971
Those who have no sense of shame at all.

00:25:35.097 --> 00:25:37.766
They're the ones who stab you in the back.

00:25:39.518 --> 00:25:41.103
They wag their tails in front of you,

00:25:41.186 --> 00:25:43.647
acting like they'd do anything for you.

00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:47.609
But when it really counts,
they betray you.

00:25:48.193 --> 00:25:50.445
They do it because they have no shame.

00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:52.739
But if you don't have shame,

00:25:53.365 --> 00:25:55.284
how are you any different from an animal?

00:25:55.784 --> 00:25:56.785
Am I right?

00:26:12.176 --> 00:26:13.177
Hey.

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:16.471
You got anything to say to me?

00:26:19.766 --> 00:26:21.852
You're colluding
with Jang Geonyoung, aren't you?

00:26:21.935 --> 00:26:24.605
If you do this, we can't work together.

00:26:24.688 --> 00:26:26.648
If you really can't trust me…

00:26:29.568 --> 00:26:30.569
just shoot me.

00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:55.844
Why do you look like that?

00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:59.806
Is Director Hwang dead?

00:27:00.307 --> 00:27:01.516
Did Baek Kitae tell you?

00:27:05.395 --> 00:27:06.647
I can't do this anymore.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.817
If even Hwang can be
snuffed out just like that…

00:27:12.694 --> 00:27:14.404
That's why you need to do this right,

00:27:14.488 --> 00:27:16.365
if you don't want Baek Kitae to kill you.

00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:19.660
If he finds out you're my mole,

00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:21.578
you think he'll let you get away with it?

00:27:22.537 --> 00:27:25.707
This only ends when Baek Kitae's caught.

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:28.001
And that's how you stay alive.

00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:31.546
This is the last time.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.756
When's the deal?

00:27:36.551 --> 00:27:37.761
I need your word.

00:27:39.137 --> 00:27:40.555
When is it?

00:27:42.224 --> 00:27:44.685
Tonight at 10:00 p.m.,

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.064
the Mangeum will rendezvous
in international waters

00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:52.567
with a Japanese vessel
loaded with meth ingredients,

00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:54.611
according to my source.

00:27:54.695 --> 00:27:56.321
One team will hit the Mangeum,

00:27:56.405 --> 00:28:01.159
and the other will raid the gang's base,
the meth lab, at the same time.

00:28:02.744 --> 00:28:04.955
- Team Mangeum.
- Team Mangeum!

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:06.665
- Team Meth Lab!
- Team Meth Lab!

00:28:07.582 --> 00:28:08.834
Now, Team Meth Lab.

00:28:09.459 --> 00:28:10.585
This is Baek Soyeong.

00:28:11.169 --> 00:28:13.922
She's a key figure
who handles the gang's accounts.

00:28:14.006 --> 00:28:17.134
She must be arrested on site tonight.

00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:19.594
- Yes, sir!
- Busan Prosecutors Narcotics Unit!

00:28:19.678 --> 00:28:21.555
- We got this!
- We got this!

00:28:21.638 --> 00:28:22.806
We got this!

00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:25.225
- We got this!
- We got this!

00:28:42.117 --> 00:28:43.118
Let's go.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.370
All right, we're moving in.

00:28:45.454 --> 00:28:46.747
Let's go.

00:29:04.556 --> 00:29:07.350
These bastards.
They're all hiding, huh?

00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:13.023
♪ Ready or not, here I come! ♪

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:17.903
Hey, you! Over there! Don't move!

00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:20.322
You bastard!

00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:22.199
Get out here!

00:29:23.158 --> 00:29:24.701
Hey! Get out here now!

00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:31.208
- What the hell?
- Get them!

00:29:32.626 --> 00:29:34.419
Mr. Jang! Are you all right?

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.797
What are you doing? Get in there! Go!

00:29:37.756 --> 00:29:38.799
Go! Move it!

00:29:38.882 --> 00:29:40.467
-You damn… Hey!
-Let's go!

00:29:41.843 --> 00:29:42.844
Come here!

00:29:46.223 --> 00:29:47.849
Hey, you! Come here!

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:49.810
Stand down, asshole!

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.311
Get back here!

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.200
Get back here, you bastard!

00:30:08.537 --> 00:30:09.830
Got you now, you little shit.

00:30:09.913 --> 00:30:12.124
You asshole,
why do you keep following me?

00:30:14.126 --> 00:30:16.211
Come on, let's go! Come on!

00:30:17.212 --> 00:30:19.172
Fine. Let's go, jackass.

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:23.468
Hey, man!

00:30:23.552 --> 00:30:24.594
That was a blank.

00:30:24.678 --> 00:30:26.012
Now it's live rounds.

00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:30.267
- Kim!
- Yes, sir!

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.937
Round them up and find the drugs!

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.564
- You heard him!
- Yes, sir!

00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:38.150
Search for the drugs!
Start searching for the drugs!

00:30:48.827 --> 00:30:50.370
Hey, eat shit!

00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:51.454
There!

00:30:58.336 --> 00:30:59.629
Back off! Go!

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.882
Hey! Back off!

00:31:06.136 --> 00:31:07.304
Back off!

00:31:07.846 --> 00:31:08.847
Fuck.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.642
Damn it, why do you keep following me?

00:31:17.063 --> 00:31:18.064
Stop! Stop it!

00:31:28.742 --> 00:31:30.952
KOOC, MENT, FUNKY STRIKE

00:31:31.036 --> 00:31:32.329
- What?
- Sir.

00:31:32.412 --> 00:31:33.788
What is this?
It's not here?

00:31:33.872 --> 00:31:35.207
- No, it's not…
- It's not?

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.875
Check deeper inside.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:40.003
Damn it.

00:31:40.086 --> 00:31:41.963
-What about here? No?
-No.

00:31:42.756 --> 00:31:43.882
Mr. Jang!

00:31:47.093 --> 00:31:48.428
There's only stuff like this.

00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:54.184
Is Baek Soyeong not here?

00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:55.518
She's not here.

00:31:58.021 --> 00:31:59.314
-Come on, open them.
-Damn it.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.483
Check this one. This one.

00:32:02.484 --> 00:32:05.028
Damn it. These are all just watches.

00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:14.454
Where's Kang Daeil?

00:32:15.038 --> 00:32:16.873
Hey! You shithead.

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:19.876
Where's Baek Soyeong?

00:32:20.877 --> 00:32:22.212
Who's that?

00:32:22.796 --> 00:32:24.256
I have no idea.

00:32:26.883 --> 00:32:29.261
I said, where's Baek Soyeong?

00:32:29.344 --> 00:32:30.345
I don't know.

00:32:31.846 --> 00:32:33.181
I really don't know!

00:32:35.809 --> 00:32:36.810
Damn it!

00:32:44.859 --> 00:32:46.444
You don't have to give me this.

00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:47.946
I'll never…

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.448
I won't ever cross you again, sir.

00:32:52.242 --> 00:32:54.703
If you really can't trust me…

00:32:56.788 --> 00:32:57.789
just shoot me.

00:33:12.095 --> 00:33:13.722
I'm sorry, sir.

00:33:29.738 --> 00:33:30.905
Lay low for a while.

00:33:31.698 --> 00:33:32.824
Yes, sir.

00:33:40.874 --> 00:33:44.294
Kang Daeil.

00:33:45.545 --> 00:33:46.880
Kang Daeil.

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:50.508
Finding Kang Daeil comes first!

00:33:51.217 --> 00:33:53.094
Stake out his family's homes

00:33:53.178 --> 00:33:56.598
and coordinate with local precincts
to post officers at every terminal.

00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:57.682
Now!

00:33:57.766 --> 00:33:59.267
- Yes, sir!
- Will do!

00:34:03.772 --> 00:34:05.815
We're from the Inspection Division.

00:34:05.899 --> 00:34:07.776
Everyone, hands off your desks.

00:34:07.859 --> 00:34:08.985
Who the hell are you?

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:11.696
We got a tip

00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:15.283
that the investigators here
resold the drugs they seized.

00:34:15.367 --> 00:34:17.077
What the hell are you talking about?

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.163
Look, who said that? What tip?

00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:21.873
Senior Investigator Kim Jeongwon.

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:24.793
Investigator Oh Yejin, right?

00:34:25.752 --> 00:34:27.587
Please come with us, the two of you.

00:34:28.713 --> 00:34:29.964
Don't move an inch.

00:34:30.048 --> 00:34:31.466
I'll be back in a minute.

00:34:33.134 --> 00:34:34.177
Move!

00:34:35.136 --> 00:34:36.721
Get everything.

00:34:37.472 --> 00:34:39.140
Geez, why are you doing this?

00:34:40.892 --> 00:34:41.893
PROSECUTOR SEO GIHO

00:34:41.976 --> 00:34:45.522
You're shutting down the Narcotics Unit
because those dealers are giving you shit?

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.565
It's the chief's orders!

00:34:48.066 --> 00:34:53.405
So we're going to let Baek Kitae
toy with the prosecution like this?

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:55.949
It's just until the inspection is over!

00:34:56.032 --> 00:34:57.117
End of discussion!

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.453
Just don't come into the office,
and keep your head down for a while!

00:35:00.537 --> 00:35:03.540
I'll pull your people
out of the Inspection Division somehow!

00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:05.333
All right, fine!

00:35:05.834 --> 00:35:07.794
I'll go pay the chief a visit

00:35:07.877 --> 00:35:09.671
and talk to him myself!

00:35:09.754 --> 00:35:10.964
Hey!

00:35:11.047 --> 00:35:12.048
Oh!

00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.053
Hey, get back inside.

00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:19.097
Get back inside!

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.351
Hey.

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.395
You think I haven't tried?

00:35:25.478 --> 00:35:29.232
The man didn't even flinch when I stood up
to him and threatened to quit!

00:35:29.315 --> 00:35:31.025
What the hell do you think you can do?

00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:35.655
Unless you want your people
to suffer more, keep your head down.

00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:38.491
Those bastards are coming at us hard!

00:35:42.746 --> 00:35:44.330
- But I--
- Jang.

00:35:45.707 --> 00:35:47.292
Stop trying to bulldoze through.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.543
Think, for God's sake.

00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:51.796
Baek's got Chief Cheon backing him.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.089
Who have you got?

00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:56.676
If you're going to go after them,
you've got to match their weight at least!

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.636
You complete idiot.

00:36:05.477 --> 00:36:09.063
"The Prosecution,
walking the straight path,

00:36:09.147 --> 00:36:10.648
upholding principle!"

00:36:24.746 --> 00:36:25.872
Hey, get back inside.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.585
You too. Get back inside.

00:36:39.427 --> 00:36:42.680
Hope you don't mind me
calling you in while I do this.

00:36:43.556 --> 00:36:45.725
I've got to take good care
of the President,

00:36:45.809 --> 00:36:48.561
but I never get time to hit the field.

00:36:49.395 --> 00:36:50.396
Not at all, sir.

00:36:50.939 --> 00:36:52.607
Don't worry about it.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:59.197
I hear Chief Cheon's been meddling
with prosecutorial authority?

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.281
Yes, sir.

00:37:01.074 --> 00:37:02.659
It seems he ordered the KCIA

00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:04.994
to investigate
Director Hwang's case directly.

00:37:18.842 --> 00:37:20.093
Go on.

00:37:20.176 --> 00:37:21.469
The truth is,

00:37:21.553 --> 00:37:23.555
one of our prosecutors
in the Narcotics Unit

00:37:24.055 --> 00:37:25.765
was investigating Baek Kitae,

00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:29.185
the KCIA department head who's in charge
of Hwang's case right now,

00:37:29.269 --> 00:37:30.854
for running a meth operation.

00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:34.732
I know it's presumptuous of me
to say this to you,

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.695
but the fact that the Chief
of the Presidential Security Service

00:37:38.778 --> 00:37:41.155
- would back someone like Baek--
- Chief Cheon is

00:37:41.948 --> 00:37:44.534
covering for a meth peddler?

00:37:55.169 --> 00:37:59.549
OSAKA, JAPAN

00:38:06.097 --> 00:38:08.016
Looks like I'm the last one.

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:10.727
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Father.

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:12.854
So,

00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:15.690
how many factories do we have left?

00:38:17.775 --> 00:38:21.613
We've still got a couple left,
but the police are watching them closely.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.741
There's no telling how long they'll last.

00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:27.702
Everyone says the meth trade's
finished in Japan.

00:38:27.785 --> 00:38:31.164
Even the Shibazaki clan seems
to be pulling out of the business.

00:38:31.247 --> 00:38:32.248
Finished? Hardly.

00:38:32.832 --> 00:38:36.836
Addicts are still crawling
all over Japan looking for drugs.

00:38:38.212 --> 00:38:41.049
We just need to build
a new plant in Korea,

00:38:41.132 --> 00:38:43.843
and the problem's solved, Father.

00:38:44.636 --> 00:38:48.348
In Korea, we can easily bring in
raw materials from Hong Kong or Taiwan,

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:50.224
and enforcement is weak.

00:38:52.352 --> 00:38:55.480
It's the ideal place to produce meth.

00:38:56.064 --> 00:39:02.528
Look, just when is this new plant
supposed to be built?

00:39:03.029 --> 00:39:08.326
Chasing pipe dreams like a fool
only puts the clan at risk.

00:39:09.494 --> 00:39:12.288
The meth market grows every year,

00:39:12.372 --> 00:39:15.166
and it's still
our biggest source of funds.

00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:18.795
Giving that up too easily

00:39:20.088 --> 00:39:22.799
is what would put the clan at risk.

00:39:24.509 --> 00:39:26.552
The real foolishness, don't you think?

00:39:26.636 --> 00:39:29.681
You're forgetting your place,
you Chosenjin!

00:39:30.515 --> 00:39:31.849
How dare you!

00:39:43.277 --> 00:39:44.362
I hope

00:39:45.822 --> 00:39:48.741
you're not making a foolish choice.

00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:53.121
Because giving a fool a chance is

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.331
just as foolish.

00:40:17.854 --> 00:40:21.983
SEOUL, KOREA

00:40:26.195 --> 00:40:28.823
Seems like you've taken
quite a liking to Baek Kitae.

00:40:28.906 --> 00:40:31.242
You forgave him
for taking out Director Hwang.

00:40:32.035 --> 00:40:34.162
He's the one who killed Hwang?

00:40:34.662 --> 00:40:35.955
You didn't know?

00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:37.832
I heard he died in a fire.

00:40:38.332 --> 00:40:39.667
Am I mistaken?

00:40:40.418 --> 00:40:41.836
Well, there was a fire, but…

00:40:43.296 --> 00:40:44.839
You just don't care, do you?

00:40:46.466 --> 00:40:49.510
The thing about greedy people is,
they're quick to get stupid.

00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:53.306
Doesn't matter to me
who sits in that seat.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.143
Apparently, you're the one
who's taken a liking to him.

00:40:59.062 --> 00:41:00.688
Is it because he's good-looking?

00:41:01.439 --> 00:41:03.316
What if something happens to Baek?

00:41:03.399 --> 00:41:04.650
Do you have an alternative?

00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:05.735
Why?

00:41:07.445 --> 00:41:08.654
Do you not trust him?

00:41:09.238 --> 00:41:10.615
I don't trust people.

00:41:11.741 --> 00:41:13.076
I trust what I hold.

00:41:18.081 --> 00:41:20.625
And that's why you're
the one who scares me most.

00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:23.753
Baek cares a lot
about his younger siblings.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.255
Especially his brother, Baek Kihyun.

00:41:27.173 --> 00:41:29.842
He's a Korea Military Academy graduate,
just like you.

00:41:29.926 --> 00:41:31.803
- A Military Academy graduate?
- Yes.

00:41:33.054 --> 00:41:34.972
His brother is his weak spot.

00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:37.892
That's what concerns me.

00:41:39.936 --> 00:41:41.646
Move to the sides!

00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:50.446
- Hey, walk straight.
- Private First Class Hong Jihwan!

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.906
I'm pushing you from behind.

00:41:51.989 --> 00:41:53.407
Thank you. Thank you, sir!

00:41:53.491 --> 00:41:54.742
- Really?
- I've got this, sir.

00:41:54.826 --> 00:41:56.828
The hell you do, damn commie.

00:42:03.042 --> 00:42:04.043
Hey!

00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:06.254
What are you doing?

00:42:14.846 --> 00:42:19.350
Hong must've twisted his ankle, sir.

00:42:20.143 --> 00:42:22.019
That's why he tumbled down the hill.

00:42:22.103 --> 00:42:23.563
Please don't worry about him.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.191
Get up.

00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:31.195
Take off your pack.

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:32.321
I've got this, sir.

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:33.406
Take off your pack.

00:42:34.198 --> 00:42:35.283
This is an order.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.844
We've got a goddamn commie
and a chickenshit.

00:42:54.927 --> 00:42:58.389
-That goddamn idiot.
-What a great fucking unit.

00:43:15.698 --> 00:43:17.742
Private Hong, it's not your watch yet.

00:43:17.825 --> 00:43:20.578
What are you doing here so early, sir?

00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:21.746
Huh?

00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:24.207
I was cold.

00:43:25.333 --> 00:43:26.584
Everyone's asleep, right?

00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:28.669
Yes, sir. They are.

00:43:29.295 --> 00:43:30.296
Good work.

00:44:10.419 --> 00:44:12.421
MILITARY POLICE

00:44:25.142 --> 00:44:26.519
One, two.

00:44:26.602 --> 00:44:27.853
One, two.

00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:37.905
Look at this little shit.
Did you just dodge?

00:44:40.074 --> 00:44:41.325
Goddamn it.

00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:43.369
How the hell did you let this happen?

00:44:43.452 --> 00:44:44.453
I'm sorry, sir!

00:44:44.537 --> 00:44:47.290
Both our jobs are on the line
if we don't contain this.

00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:48.833
-You hear me?
-Yes, sir!

00:44:48.916 --> 00:44:51.669
Keep checking on the injured
until sunrise,

00:44:51.752 --> 00:44:55.047
and if anyone else dies,
report it immediately!

00:44:58.759 --> 00:44:59.885
Yes, sir!

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:05.349
Damn it.

00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:07.977
You little…

00:45:09.603 --> 00:45:10.980
You fucking bastard.

00:45:11.772 --> 00:45:13.441
Are you trying to screw me over?

00:45:15.318 --> 00:45:16.944
I warned you, didn't I?

00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:21.449
I told you to get that damn kid
transferred or whatever

00:45:21.532 --> 00:45:22.992
to keep him out of trouble.

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:25.911
Hey, look at this mess.

00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:30.791
You brought this on yourself.

00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:32.418
Get it?

00:46:19.465 --> 00:46:20.466
PERSONAL RECORD

00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:22.009
BAEK KIHYUN
SEX: MALE

00:46:47.368 --> 00:46:48.369
Baek Kihyun,

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.413
it's been a long time.

00:46:51.163 --> 00:46:53.207
We haven't seen each other
since graduation?

00:46:54.041 --> 00:46:56.001
Don't cut corners
just because you know me.

00:46:56.085 --> 00:46:57.169
Do what you always do.

00:46:57.253 --> 00:46:58.629
INVESTIGATION OFFICER
NAM SANGUK

00:46:58.712 --> 00:47:00.005
Still cocky as ever, huh?

00:47:00.881 --> 00:47:02.633
Because you graduated top of our class?

00:47:03.342 --> 00:47:05.302
So you think everyone's beneath you?

00:47:05.886 --> 00:47:08.180
You're Security Command now,
but you haven't changed.

00:47:08.889 --> 00:47:10.474
Cut the smart-ass act and proceed.

00:47:11.642 --> 00:47:13.018
There must be a reason they sent you.

00:47:13.102 --> 00:47:14.103
Well…

00:47:15.729 --> 00:47:17.606
I heard you testified
your company commander

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.234
shot down the transfer request
for Private Hong.

00:47:20.317 --> 00:47:21.569
Is that true?

00:47:21.652 --> 00:47:23.028
I don't make things up.

00:47:23.112 --> 00:47:24.447
I said exactly what happened.

00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.577
You know,

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.163
you really haven't changed
a bit, have you?

00:47:33.622 --> 00:47:36.083
Still condescending as fuck
when you don't know shit.

00:47:39.545 --> 00:47:40.713
Your company commander?

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:43.966
Apparently, his uncle's
the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs,

00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.802
and his father runs
Myeongjung Construction.

00:47:47.303 --> 00:47:48.929
The best way to clean up this mess

00:47:49.013 --> 00:47:51.932
is for someone
to take responsibility and step down.

00:47:52.516 --> 00:47:54.894
But it's never going to be your commander.

00:47:54.977 --> 00:47:57.188
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

00:47:57.271 --> 00:47:58.272
Get it?

00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:02.526
You know what hits me hard
every single day at Security Command?

00:48:04.028 --> 00:48:05.738
No matter how great you are,

00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:09.575
you can't do jack on your own.

00:48:10.242 --> 00:48:14.163
So stop acting like you're the only one
with integrity and rewrite your statement.

00:48:14.246 --> 00:48:15.748
It's not too late.

00:48:16.624 --> 00:48:18.751
If you cooperate now,
I can keep you in uniform.

00:48:22.713 --> 00:48:23.714
Hey.

00:48:24.215 --> 00:48:25.549
What are academy buddies for?

00:48:25.633 --> 00:48:27.510
We should cover each other's asses, right?

00:48:27.593 --> 00:48:31.722
So from now on,
you just need to do what I tell you.

00:48:32.306 --> 00:48:33.307
All right?

00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:38.062
You mean you want me to take the hit
instead of ruining my commander's career?

00:48:40.773 --> 00:48:41.774
Hey.

00:48:44.318 --> 00:48:47.655
I testified the way I did
because I knew you were going to do this.

00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:49.323
What?

00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:52.076
I don't want to ruin my own career either.

00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:59.208
Tell him, if he wants to use
his uncle for an easy out,

00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.545
he'd better rethink making me
the scapegoat and handle it properly.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.047
I'm not going down alone.

00:49:21.647 --> 00:49:22.648
Sir!

00:49:23.732 --> 00:49:25.734
Someone's here to see you, sir.

00:49:25.818 --> 00:49:27.152
He's in the visiting area.

00:49:32.366 --> 00:49:34.118
How can I believe you?

00:49:37.037 --> 00:49:38.622
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

00:49:40.207 --> 00:49:42.459
But you know as well as I do,
Mr. Baek Kihyun.

00:49:43.335 --> 00:49:45.588
The fact that Mr. Baek Kitae has

00:49:46.171 --> 00:49:48.132
that much power at his age.

00:49:48.632 --> 00:49:51.427
Well, that doesn't just happen on its own.

00:49:54.513 --> 00:49:55.598
Your sister.

00:49:57.891 --> 00:50:00.811
Ms. Baek Soyeong is helping him
with the business.

00:50:01.395 --> 00:50:03.272
If I arrest Baek Kitae,

00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:06.191
your sister goes to prison,

00:50:06.275 --> 00:50:10.321
and you, Mr. Baek Kihyun,
might be forced out of the army too.

00:50:13.449 --> 00:50:17.578
Before that happens, you should talk
to her and get her to confess.

00:50:20.998 --> 00:50:24.835
If you could have taken my brother down
so easily, you wouldn't be here right now.

00:50:25.419 --> 00:50:27.630
The fact that you even had to come to me

00:50:27.713 --> 00:50:29.882
means you're in a tight spot, right?

00:50:31.425 --> 00:50:34.678
So bad that you, a prosecutor,
are threatening me.

00:50:40.643 --> 00:50:42.978
You're a lot like your brother.

00:50:45.022 --> 00:50:47.024
But there's one thing you don't know.

00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:50.235
I'm never going to give up.

00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:54.156
I'll make sure Baek Kitae faces the law
and pays for what he's done.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.583
Mr. Baek Kihyun!

00:51:05.876 --> 00:51:07.503
Think carefully!

00:51:12.341 --> 00:51:13.342
What's your plan?

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.137
How long will you let
Jang Geonyoung run loose?

00:51:18.931 --> 00:51:21.141
I heard from the prosecution's
Inspection Division.

00:51:21.642 --> 00:51:24.019
They say they can't hold
his team much longer.

00:51:25.104 --> 00:51:26.105
Okay?

00:51:27.189 --> 00:51:29.942
If we go at him half-baked,
it'll be worse than doing nothing.

00:51:31.527 --> 00:51:32.778
So what are you thinking?

00:51:36.657 --> 00:51:37.825
I'll handle it.

00:51:37.908 --> 00:51:39.118
Hey, you…

00:51:43.288 --> 00:51:44.498
Just tell me, okay?

00:51:45.624 --> 00:51:47.668
Handle it how exactly?

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.841
Come in.

00:51:57.177 --> 00:51:58.595
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.

00:51:59.096 --> 00:52:00.097
It's urgent.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:03.350
What the hell are you looking at?

00:52:04.435 --> 00:52:05.853
You telling me to leave?

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:09.273
Spit it out.

00:52:09.356 --> 00:52:11.150
What is it? Just tell me.

00:52:13.026 --> 00:52:15.362
I'm afraid there's a problem
with your brother.

00:52:16.572 --> 00:52:18.532
Security Command's launched
an investigation,

00:52:18.615 --> 00:52:19.867
and it's not looking good.

00:52:21.785 --> 00:52:22.786
What?

00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:25.706
Who's here? The KCIA? Baek's brother…

00:52:26.582 --> 00:52:28.792
What are you talking about, idiot?

00:52:40.179 --> 00:52:42.806
Well, who are you?

00:53:24.306 --> 00:53:25.307
Stand up straight.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.268
Back to your senses?

00:53:28.852 --> 00:53:29.853
Yes.

00:53:29.937 --> 00:53:31.522
Go get Baek Kihyun.

00:53:32.606 --> 00:53:33.607
Yes, sir.

00:53:54.378 --> 00:53:56.213
How did you hear about it?

00:53:56.755 --> 00:53:59.383
Did you think I wouldn't find out
if you kept quiet?

00:53:59.466 --> 00:54:01.176
I can handle this on my own.

00:54:02.886 --> 00:54:04.221
Handle it how exactly?

00:54:04.304 --> 00:54:06.181
I said, I'll handle it on my own!

00:54:24.867 --> 00:54:26.118
I told you.

00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:31.498
If you're angry at reality, get stronger.

00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:41.633
If you don't want to be
looked down on, strike first.

00:54:42.175 --> 00:54:44.803
If someone blocks your path,
get rid of them.

00:54:45.596 --> 00:54:47.139
How many times have I told you

00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:49.975
that guys with power
run the world at the end of the day?

00:54:53.687 --> 00:54:55.397
If you're done, I'll be going now.

00:54:56.064 --> 00:54:57.065
Stop.

00:54:59.234 --> 00:55:00.861
You cocky little…

00:55:04.156 --> 00:55:07.367
Your company commander will be
the one forced out, not you.

00:55:09.453 --> 00:55:12.497
Security Command will have an opening
next month, so get ready.

00:55:14.249 --> 00:55:15.292
This is power.

00:55:15.834 --> 00:55:17.044
Got it?

00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:21.757
I'm going to Vietnam next week.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.177
What the hell would you go there for?

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:27.262
That "power" you always talk about.

00:55:28.096 --> 00:55:30.015
I figured I'd try to earn some myself.

00:55:30.098 --> 00:55:32.434
All you need to do is what I tell you!

00:55:32.517 --> 00:55:34.144
I can take care of myself!

00:55:34.227 --> 00:55:35.228
You little…

00:55:43.737 --> 00:55:45.322
So I want you

00:55:47.115 --> 00:55:49.743
to please just get your own act together.

00:55:50.243 --> 00:55:51.578
PROSECUTOR JANG GEONYOUNG

00:55:51.662 --> 00:55:53.789
Before you wreck my life
and Soyeong's too.

00:56:09.096 --> 00:56:10.347
Ms. Oh.

00:56:11.139 --> 00:56:12.683
What are you doing out here?

00:56:12.766 --> 00:56:14.851
Mr. Jang, where have you been?

00:56:15.769 --> 00:56:17.521
I went to see Baek Kihyun.

00:56:18.146 --> 00:56:19.147
Baek Kihyun?

00:56:19.856 --> 00:56:21.358
Things must've been rough.

00:56:22.693 --> 00:56:23.694
No, it's okay.

00:56:23.777 --> 00:56:26.071
Appreciate the effort.
Let's get inside.

00:56:28.573 --> 00:56:29.574
Well,

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.578
why did you go to see Baek Kihyun, sir?

00:56:36.289 --> 00:56:38.417
Thought I'd stir up Baek Kitae too.

00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:42.421
We've got to hit back
just as hard as he hit us.

00:56:42.504 --> 00:56:45.048
So you're not giving up?

00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:48.385
Why would I give up?

00:56:48.927 --> 00:56:50.804
It's my job to catch criminals.

00:56:50.887 --> 00:56:54.182
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's eat first and get our strength back.

00:56:54.975 --> 00:56:56.893
Where's Mr. Kim?

00:56:56.977 --> 00:56:57.978
I'm not sure.

00:56:58.478 --> 00:56:59.896
He said he'd be here soon.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:02.357
But I think we ran out of rice.

00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:04.025
Should I cook some ramyeon?

00:57:05.485 --> 00:57:08.071
Shoot. We're out of ramyeon, too.

00:57:08.905 --> 00:57:10.449
I'll run out and get some.

00:57:10.532 --> 00:57:13.452
Oh, no. I'll go, sir.

00:57:13.535 --> 00:57:14.619
I'll be right back.

00:57:26.506 --> 00:57:27.632
Take care.

00:57:29.176 --> 00:57:30.177
Oh, man.

00:57:30.969 --> 00:57:32.137
It started raining.

00:57:40.228 --> 00:57:43.023
I won't live as cattle.

00:57:43.106 --> 00:57:44.691
I'll be the one with power.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.404
I'll make the herd kneel before me,

00:57:50.405 --> 00:57:52.908
drag down anyone more powerful than me,

00:57:54.034 --> 00:57:56.328
and change the world in the end.

00:58:06.379 --> 00:58:08.548
- Ms. Oh, you're here alone?
- Yes.

00:58:08.632 --> 00:58:11.176
- Where's Mr. Jang?
- He went to get some ramyeon.

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:12.511
Hey, the water's boiling.

00:58:16.389 --> 00:58:17.766
Man, I'm exhausted.

00:58:30.987 --> 00:58:32.405
That's just the way it is.

00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:34.449
The world has always been

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:36.827
a battlefield for the powerful.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:13.942
