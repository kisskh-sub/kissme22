[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.789
[Episode 34]

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.560
My wish is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.000
to see Hong Ye again.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.770
When did you arrive?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.970
I was just passing by

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.610
and saw you standing here alone.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.210
My wounds have healed completely.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.570
I came to thank you.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.890
Where's my gift?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.320
A thank-you isn't sincere without a gift.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.150
This is...?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.640
This is a mermaid pearl.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.400
It holds great life energy.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.490
In times of crisis,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.890
it can save your life.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.340
I know your power is strong,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.500
but just in case.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.350
So, you're saying that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.730
you just happened to come here,

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640
today just happens to be my birthday,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.770
you just happened to have a gift with you,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.240
and this bracelet

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.100
just happens to fit me perfectly?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.610
This might just be

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.110
fate.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.190
The merfolk are known for bad tempers.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.750
I imagine this mermaid pearl

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.010
wasn't easy to obtain.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.020
We barely know each other.

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.400
Why would I deliberately

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.200
prepare a birthday gift for you?

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.530
I, Ao Hen, repay kindness

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.800
and avenge grudges.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.740
Don't read too much into it.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.240
Thank you for your gift.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.850
Xiao Yao!

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.310
It's my birthday today.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.310
I won't accept any challenges

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.570
or get into any fights.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.470
Of course I know it's your birthday.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.070
I came especially
to bring you a birthday gift.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.080
No wonder he couldn't
catch up to the Dragon Lord.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.670
Look at this Heaven-Shattering Hammer.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.340
It's forged from a meteor.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.640
One strike

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.640
can flatten a small mountain.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.019
And this...

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.240
The Adamant Shield

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.760
is forged from Que Mountain crystal.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.520
It can attack

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.200
and defend.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.730
Attack and defend.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.590
It can...

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.390
Can...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.540
It's just a pot.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.159
You'll definitely like this one.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.540
This is the Golden Chiming Spear,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.220
one of my favorites.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.440
A thrust sounds like a phoenix cry.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.880
A sweeping strike...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.600
sounds like a dragon's roar.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.950
What an awful sound.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.350
How could you liken that
to a dragon's roar?

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.180
Thank you.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.800
But do you think

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.310
I still need weapons?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.310
Of course these weapons

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.630
are prepared for weaker species.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.800
Great demons like us don't need them.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.600
Just treat them as accessories.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.230
Though your power is strong,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.640
you're small in stature.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.120
Holding these

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.870
looks more impressive
than being empty-handed.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.400
It'll make others fear you.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.090
I appreciate the thought.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.870
There's more.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.670
This bow

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.480
is said to have been
left behind by Hou Yi.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.920
Just channel your power
into the bowstring,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.780
and even without arrows,
it can pierce heavy armor.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.920
That's right.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.120
Channel your power into the bowstring.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.090
Decide on a target in your mind.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.600
Yao!

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.350
Disperse!

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.800
Are you okay?

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.570
Yao,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.810
for your birthday,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.560
are you planning to kill
a great demon for entertainment?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.860
Why so petty?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.330
I didn't hurt you, did I?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.920
I haven't finished the one
you gave me last time,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.480
and now you're bringing a new one again.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.880
Didn't we make a promise?

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.560
To enjoy good food
and drinks together forever?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.920
When I find something good,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.000
I'll bring it to you right away.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.680
Hmm.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.920
Forever?

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.420
Of course.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.630
That's my promise with Yao.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.240
Long Zhi.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.930
Set the table.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.300
I'll share this fine wine with these two.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.430
Thank you both for coming to celebrate
my birthday today.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.560
I, Xiao Yao, toast to you both.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.480
Yao.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.700
He's not the one you have feelings for,
is he?

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.480
He's just a brute

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.120
who isn't worthy of you at all.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.380
What are you thinking?

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.510
Xiao Yao,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.850
even if you have someone you fancy,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.920
you should still be mindful of your status
as a dragon.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.560
If we're talking about suitable matches,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.480
us vine serpents

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.530
at least share ancestry with the dragons.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.070
But you Qiongqis

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.750
are simply

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.560
worlds apart from us.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.380
You

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.480
have never taken cultivation seriously,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.270
and only know how to play all day.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.270
How dare you claim shared ancestry?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.510
No matter how high one's cultivation,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.120
without true spiritual connection,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.410
you'll eventually part ways anyway.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.870
She's an Azure Dragon.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.920
Being with you

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.320
would only hold her back!

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.800
Who are you?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.130
Why do you get to decide?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.920
Enough, both of you!

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.360
He spits in my face every time.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.580
So what if he spits in your face?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.120
You're spitting in the food!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.780
Who told you to spit? Sit down!

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.010
Sit down!

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.390
It's my birthday today.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.050
Are you here to cause trouble?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.100
If you really want to give me gifts,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.270
then go find things I haven't seen before.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.670
Something fresh and new.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.920
We've all lived for thousands of years.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.830
What could there be that we haven't seen?

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.630
That depends on your abilities.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.000
Yao,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.040
then does that

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.170
Lantern Grass from last time count?

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.680
It does.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.810
But this time I want something newer.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.190
No problem.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:16.870
Wait for me-

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040
Goodbye, Yao!

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.750
Goodbye.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.540
Xiao Yao.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:24.890
Don't worry.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.380
Before your birthday ends,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.980
I'll definitely find something for you.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.130
Oh my heavens.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.270
Happy birthday, Dragon Lord!

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.840
We've been preparing for days

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.170
and hope you'll like it.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:56.390
Come in!

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.150
What is this?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.440
You said you wanted to find some humans,

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.040
so we

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.400
arranged a little performance for you.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.840
This is the final trial.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.440
When only one is left standing,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.000
the trial will be completed.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.630
Begin.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.730
Long Zhi!

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.600
These three

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.390
killed their way through a hundred humans.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.480
They're considered quite capable
among the humans.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.360
Killed?

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.910
We captured a hundred humans

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.860
and told them only one would live.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.440
If they live, they get to serve
the Dragon Lord.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.030
Being able to serve the Dragon Lord alive

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.430
is their greatest honor.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.480
Hong Ye!

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.220
Biting off more than you can chew.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.910
Quick, put him on the bed.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.790
Do it now!

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.480
Dragon Lord.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.440
Humans are weak.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.670
If you force power into him

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.480
in his current condition,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.610
he definitely won't be able to take it.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.440
What should we do then?

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.440
I didn't expect him to be so fragile.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.310
Dragon Lord,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.670
what's so special about this human

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.400
that you care so much about him?

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.760
I only punished him
because he offended you.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.910
Please forgive me, Dragon Lord.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.670
Dragon Lord,

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.530
humans are weak and have short lives.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.390
Even if you save him,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.620
he won't live long.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.290
Whether he lives or dies

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.930
is for Heaven to decide,

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.200
not you or me.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:28.960
But-

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.710
You claim to protect all beings,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.570
yet you never count humans among them.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.750
When demons treat humans this way,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.680
have you ever thought about karma?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.180
One day in the future,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.310
humans will treat demons the same way.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.910
Humans are lowly and incapable.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.910
How could they ever be above demons?

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.510
You said yourself you wanted a human.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.240
We were just following orders.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.960
Were we wrong for that?

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.480
Leave.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.670
But this is your bedchamber.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.030
How can we leave him here?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.550
Let's go.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.200
What?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.790
It's just a human.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.350
If the Dragon Lord likes him,
let her be.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.000
But tribulation is so dangerous.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.510
Even the Dragon Lord has lost her mind.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.240
When it's my turn to face tribulation,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.900
will I even be able to survive?

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.360
Relax.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.360
Your tribulation

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.200
won't come for another thousand years.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.600
According to the Dragon Lord,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.440
by then,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.270
humans will be more powerful than you

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.930
and will have already captured you
as a servant.

The Dragon Lord actually let that human

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.440
live in her own chamber

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.430
and moved herself to a side hall.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.650
He's just a mere human.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.120
Why is the Dragon Lord
treating him so well?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.240
If you ask me,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.360
the Dragon Lord just thinks

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.320
keeping cats or dogs is too boring,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.700
so she's keeping a human as a pet instead.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.840
Hong Ye.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.090
Hong Ye.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.460
You're awake.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.170
Your fever has gone down.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.700
When did you wake up?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.350
Why didn't saying anything?

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.000
Here,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360
drink some water.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.070
Are you alright?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.300
Don't come closer!

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.520
Why do you always want to kill me?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.670
Why?

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.390
Why do you think?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.520
You demons force humans

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.950
to kill each other for your amusement.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.410
Thousands of people have died
by your hands.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.960
Don't you deserve to die?

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:05.750
Come.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.359
Drink some water first.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.819
I don't want it!

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.400
They say

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480
the winner

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.730
gets the honor of serving the Dragon Lord.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.069
I would rather die

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:28.640
than accept such an honor.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.880
Then die.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.960
I'll watch.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.370
You still have unfinished business,

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.430
and aren't willing to die now, right?

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.440
Whether you have someone you miss

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.740
or a revenge unpaid,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.830
they're all reasons for you to stay alive.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.640
Otherwise, you wouldn't still be standing

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.500
after fighting a hundred others.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.270
My revenge

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.390
is the revenge of all humans.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.320
Then heal yourself first

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.150
before thinking about revenge.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.040
You are the Dragon Lord.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.920
You're allowing me
to seek revenge against the demons?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.030
What do you want?

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.130
What do you think I want from you?

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.540
Now I can understand

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.110
how Hong Ye felt
when he first entered Demons' Valley.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.640
Hong Ye.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.310
You've just barely survived.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.590
Why are you moving around?

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.590
Just lie down.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.180
With this body of mine,

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.020
I can't serve the Dragon Lord anyway.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.750
There's no purpose in keeping me alive.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:04.550
Let me go.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.520
You're not to leave
until you're fully recovered.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.930
I have more important things to do.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.440
I must leave.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.270
Hong Ye.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.680
I saved your life.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.930
You need to repay this debt, right?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.640
What exactly do you want?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.150
Heal your wounds and then go.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.790
If you want to recover faster,

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.160
you need to walk around.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.330
I can walk by myself.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.750
Then you have to be careful.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.070
If you get hurt,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.000
I'll have to take care of you again.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.370
I don't need your care.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:40.750
Hong Ye!

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.950
The Dragon Lord is too nice to that human.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.710
Good thing it's just a surface wound.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.840
Otherwise, you'd be suffering again.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.920
Why?

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.500
Why are you treating me like this?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.720
You're not killing me

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.480
or letting me leave,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.940
and you even take such good care of me.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.640
I really don't understand.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.750
Perhaps the fate between us

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.210
has not yet run its course.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.150
Perhaps one day, humans will

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.040
be stronger than demons.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.220
If that day comes,

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.490
I hope you'll remember our bond

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.250
and not try to stab me again.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.290
Stronger than demons.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.720
Yes.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.110
True strength doesn't
come from external power,

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.470
but from within.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.720
Since humans exist in this world,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.520
they must have their strengths.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:47.700
Otherwise,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.070
with demons oppressing humans for so long,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.130
humans would have vanished long ago.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:53.910
Isn't that right?

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.540
From now on,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.170
no matter where you are,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.190
you must not belittle humans

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.340
or take human lives without cause.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.700
Hong Ye will stay here to recover

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.120
until he's fully healed.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.410
During this time,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.720
all his needs

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.450
must be attended to with care.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.000
Treat him as you would treat me.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:28.430
Is that understood?

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.440
Yes.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.240
Yes.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.920
I heard you asked for some pearls.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.960
Do you need anything else?

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.790
Just ask.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.450
This is enough.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.410
I just did something small

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.040
to show my appreciation.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.090
For me?

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.660
Yes.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.640
I ground the pearls into powder

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.000
and added some warm water.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.200
If you soak your hands in it,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.600
it'll nourish your skin.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.310
Would you like to try?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.860
If I do this,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.410
will it make the Dragon Lord happy?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.920
Just call me Xiao Yao.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.200
As long as you don't insist on leaving,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.130
anything you do will make me happy.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:10.070
Xiao Yao.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.390
How dare you!

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.270
Long Yu!

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.900
You dare try to assassinate
the Dragon Lord?

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.020
I'll kill you!

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.270
Dragon Lord!

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.010
He tried to kill you twice.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.610
Why are you protecting him?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.440
I said he wasn't to be harmed.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.260
Do my words mean nothing to you?

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:32.960
Apologize!

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.910
He's human!

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.520
You're right.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.320
Words aren't sincere enough.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.790
You should suffer the same pain as him
to truly apologize.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.640
Dragon Lord.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.590
Because of him,

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.140
you don't care about me anymore?

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.590
Normally, I can reason with you kindly,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.070
but I can also

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.470
be stern and teach you
the meaning of rules.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.680
Now, can you tell me

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.700
why you've repeatedly tried to kill me?

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.820
I thought

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.420
you were keeping me trapped in the palace

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.510
just to humiliate me.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.190
But I never expected

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.610
that you would

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.690
turn against your own kind for me.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.800
Xiao Yao.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.680
I was wrong.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.440
Between us,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.890
there's no need for hostility.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.520
If you're willing,

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.460
let's start as friends,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.110
alright?

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.030
I can also promise you.

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.990
As long as I'm here,

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.880
the dragons won't harm any humans.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.920
Be careful next time!

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.350
If you leave the water again,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.210
you'll end up on someone's plate.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.590
Fortunately, it met a kind Water Dragon.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.980
and survived.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.850
If you can treat the aquatic folk kindly,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.880
why can't you treat humans the same?

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.420
They don't deserve it.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.350
Why?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.920
Humans are the lowest beings in the world,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.240
without a trace of power.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.770
Not having spiritual power
makes them lowly?

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.830
Because of my birthday,

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.630
so many people died for nothing.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.680
Even an Azure Dragon

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.030
might not be able to bear the karma

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.270
of so much killing.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.900
If you lose reverence for life,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.880
how can dragon
command respect from others?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.070
As an Azure Dragon,

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.510
what kind of beings am I protecting?

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.270
The world

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.370
doesn't just consist of dragons.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.210
If you don't understand this,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.570
you'll always be a little dragon,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.000
and never become a true Long Yu.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.500
Thank you for your guidance, Dragon Lord.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.960
I'll go practice my cultivation
right away.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.800
What you said to him—

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.000
was it true?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.130
Of course.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.230
I'm feeling much better now

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.810
and want to go for a walk.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.610
Do you want me to accompany you?

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.640
Mm.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.460
What are you listening to?

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.240
The sound of the sea.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.160
You can really hear it.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.310
This conch shell

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.240
has only a trace of power,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.610
but it still lets you feel
the presence of the ocean.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.640
But its power is too small,

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.030
just like humans.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.070
The law of nature
is survival of the fittest.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.990
But humans refuse to accept this fate.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.560
We will find ways
to make ourselves stronger.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.820
Have you heard of the Yuli Spring?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.010
I was originally a human prince

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.560
who moved the deity
during a heaven ritual.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.090
To free humans from our short lives

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.960
and from being oppressed by demons,

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.820
the deity opened a divine spring

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.700
on the celestial mountain in the sea,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.730
called Yuli.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.080
Drink from this spring,

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.060
and humans can achieve immortality.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.850
Unfortunately,

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.880
we humans have to

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.140
find the celestial mountain ourselves.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.040
So even ten thousand years ago,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.720
everyone was already
exhausting their energy

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.380
to search for the Yuli Spring.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.310
Have you assembled the Kunlun Mirror?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.740
The Kunlun Mirror?

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.310
Never heard of it.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.930
Then how did you search
for the celestial mountain?

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.780
We put all our efforts
into building a ship,

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.110
hoping to try our luck at sea.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.440
But unexpectedly,

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.480
we soon encountered a tsunami.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:55.830
So

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.190
that's how we met

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.130
on the shore.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:05.070
Yes.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.040
We will definitely find
the celestial mountain.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.250
Humans are truly delusional.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.550
The seas have always
belonged to us dragons.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.880
I've roamed these waters for years,

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.240
and I've never seen a celestial mountain,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.640
only scattered islands.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.590
Besides,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.110
the ships built by humans

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.120
are really crude.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.030
One strong wind and they fall apart.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.830
They can't even reach the deep waters,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.890
let alone find a celestial mountain.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.400
That's why I said

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.350
dragons should help with the search.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.160
What do human affairs

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.880
have to do with us dragons?

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.790
Long Yu accepts the order.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.850
I'll go search now.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.900
Has this kid gone mad in his cultivation?

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.200
If the little dragon goes alone

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.140
and encounters a great demon,

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.160
I'm afraid...

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:08.270
Yes.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.010
Long Zhi accepts the order.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.430
This boat

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.290
is from the dragons?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.010
Dragons don't need boats.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.790
This was all I could find.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.980
Would you please talk to me?

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.350
Such a handsome face,

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.270
sitting there in silence,

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.330
it's like you're guarding my spirit.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.000
I once received a divine vision too.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.030
Would you like to know

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:14.960
what I saw?

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.440
I saw what my future husband looks like.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.520
You...

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:25.610
You are my destined husband.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.510
The deity

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.850
is supreme.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.100
How could they give such personal
romantic revelations?

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.160
Don't you have

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.160
customs for praying for marriage blessings

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.750
or fertility goddesses or something?

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.400
No.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.240
We aren't even married yet.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.300
What's all this talk about children?

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.920
I see.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.660
But the fact is you'll become my husband.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.060
Humans are still suffering greatly.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.680
I can't think about personal romance.

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:19.040
Don't be afraid.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.420
Sit tight. I'm here.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:36.900
Hold on to me.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.230
Hold tight.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:52.560
Hong Ye has survived a tsunami.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.630
At this moment,

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.080
he must be frightened.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.590
But he thought first

00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.470
of my safety.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.770
It's okay now.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.510
Mm.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.510
They all treat me

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.510
like an all-powerful Azure Dragon.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:26.510
Only you

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.270
protect me like an ordinary woman.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.110
Thank you.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.120
I'm a man.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:47.860
The oars are gone.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.760
If the oars are gone,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.190
let this boat

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.350
drift with the waves.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.880
There won't be any more danger.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.450
Mm.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.150
The current Hong Ye has no power

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:36.980
and is oppressed by demons,

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.800
yet in moments of danger,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.710
he still protects me with his life.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.110
How could someone like him

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.480
be the evil man

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.410
that the Qiong Qis speak of
thousands of years later?

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.680
You're awake.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.810
Thank you.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:26.490
What about you?

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:29.040
You didn't sleep?

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.270
Look!

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.340
There's a fishing village ahead.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.660
Are you hungry?

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.550
I'll find a house

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.480
and make you something delicious.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.550
Hmm,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:48.620
I'm hungry.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:57.850
They say

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.210
the owner of this house

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:01.480
went to sea
and was never heard from again.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.760
Let's rest here.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.150
I didn't think that you could cook.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:06.760
Of course.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:08.720
I'm a man.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.270
The conditions here are far more modest

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.400
than in the Dragon Palace.

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.660
You'll have to make do.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.100
My old place wasn't even this nice.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.880
It smells so good.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.960
This fragrance,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.030
I could smell it every day
and never get tired of it.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:42.550
Drink slowly.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.070
Mm.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.130
Careful, it's hot.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:52.910
Delicious.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.880
But just soup alone won't fill me up.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.990
Make me a bowl of noodles please.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.190
What are noodles?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.600
Oh, right.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.000
They don't exist yet.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.630
They're delicious.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.800
I'll teach you how to make them.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.200
Go find some wheat flour.

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.440
Okay.
