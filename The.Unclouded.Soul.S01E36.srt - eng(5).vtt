[Episode 36]

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.130
As long as you live,

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.210
I'll make you suffer every day.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.259
Can't take it anymore?

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.039
I knew it.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.610
A human like you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.590
could never make her happy.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.050
But if you promise

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.850
to never see Xiao Yao again,

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.300
I'll let you go.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.560
Say it.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.669
Say it.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.910
Say it out loud!

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.590
Why aren't you speaking?

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.079
Promise me you won't see her again,

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.360
and I'll end your suffering.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.340
Just say it.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.670
Say it!

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400
If I can see her again,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.220
this little suffering

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.960
means nothing to me.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
Even if I kill you,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.240
Yao probably still won't like me.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.350
I can let you go.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.610
But you must promise

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.610
that for as long as you live,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
you will never...

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.890
Never

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.120
betray her.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.010
Do you really think
I don't dare to kill you?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.710
You are pure and sacred,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.010
and shouldn't coexist with
the filthy humans.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.640
On the day of the eclipse,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.490
you should have killed me.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.450
But instead, you healed my hand,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.870
making me think of you day and night.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.000
For my Ao Hen Clan,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.240
cultivation is a battle.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.290
We fall when defeated,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.170
and lick our own wounds when victorious.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.760
For thousands of years,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.350
you're the only one
to have ever tended to my wounds.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.950
I only helped you out of pity,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.120
nothing more.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.730
I won't force you to like me.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.490
But I will do my utmost

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.610
to do anything that benefits you.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.080
And I will completely eliminate

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.899
anything that harms you.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.390
How could you possibly know better than me

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.149
what's best for me?

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.160
Thank you for your concern,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.840
but please stop meddling in my affairs.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.909
I'm asking you one last time.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.130
Where is Hong Ye?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.670
I swear,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.020
if you just give me one chance,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.620
I'll protect you for ten thousand years.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.160
Yao!

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.240
Yao—

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.490
Xiao Yao.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.400
I'm sorry.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.140
I'm late.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.250
Let's go.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.280
Your behavior

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.110
is truly disgraceful.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.680
Did you think I couldn't see

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.430
how much you've made Hong Ye suffer?

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.950
At least I never truly wanted to kill him.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.880
How does it feel

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.330
to hand Hong Ye over to Xiao Yao yourself?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.330
Better than having Yao hate me.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.350
After cultivating for thousands of years,

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.020
both of us are no match for a mere human.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.070
Is your mouth

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.260
laced with poison?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.680
Hong Ye!

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.060
Your meridians aren't like a demon's.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.280
I can only temporarily suppress
the turmoil in your body.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.970
When we return to the Dragon Palace,

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.370
we'll heal you properly.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.180
I won't go back
to the Dragon Palace with you.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.760
I will protect you well from now on.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.360
I won't let any demon hurt you again.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.290
You've already helped me so much.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.890
I can't always hide under your protection.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.160
And I can't become your burden.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.430
Don't say that.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.800
Xiao Yao.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.870
Thank you.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.720
During our time together,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.310
you've given me respect.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.600
You've also made me believe

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.630
that humans

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.870
and demons

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.270
can coexist peacefully.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.280

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.320
Father!

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:32.760
Father.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.390
Prince Ye,

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.670
you've finally returned.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.030
Who did this?

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.890
The Ao Hen Clan.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.370
You led the fleet

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.480
to search for the celestial mountain
and didn't return for over a month.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.030
We sent search parties again and again,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.960
but in the end, along the shore,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.400
we only found the wreckage of your fleet.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.160
Everyone thought you had perished,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.760
and the emperor
fell gravely ill because of it.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.720
Just recently,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.250
news came from a southern fishing village

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.750
that villagers had seen you.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.080
The emperor rose from his sickbed,

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.180
saying he wanted to welcome you home.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.090
He was planning to leave today,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.120
but unexpectedly,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.530
the Ao Hen Clan
descended from the sky just now

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.630
and destroyed everything they could!

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.550
We have failed.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.670
We couldn't protect the emperor.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.970
Prince Ye,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.780
the human race is now in grave danger.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.870
Since you have returned safely,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.330
we beg you
to immediately ascend the throne.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.600
Lead humanity in continuing
the search for the Yuli Spring

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.190
to give our race

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.550
a glimmer of hope in this world.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.190
Since the demons haven't
wiped out all humans yet,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.650
I shall borrow the power of heaven

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.630
to fight for humanity's future.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.200
Long live Emperor Ye!

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.470
Heaven and earth,

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.650
the origin of all energy.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.270
Within and beyond the Three Realms,

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.290
only the Way is supreme.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.600
Encompassing heaven and earth,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.370
it nurtures all living beings.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.810
Profound wisdom penetrates,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.850
as the five energies rise.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.240
The human emperor

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.960
prays for heaven's mandate,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.430
seeking divine guidance

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.070
to find the Yuli Spring

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.790
and protect all people
from suffering and hardship.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.800
The celestial mountain
and Yuli have not appeared

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.570
because humans
have not shown true sincerity.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.670
Deity, I beg you for guidance.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.940
I am willing to find the Yuli

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.080
at any cost.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.120
As with all things in the world,

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.430
if you desire it intensely,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.760
you will become enlightened.

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:07.859
If humans wish to become powerful,

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.640
they must first have a powerful heart.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.400
Then will you be able to carry

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.270
the divine power bestowed upon you.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.440
I, Hong Ye,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.770
am willing to receive divine power...

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.910
with my mortal body.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.320
I grant you power

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:55.460
to aid your cultivation.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.750
If you find Yuli,

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.160
only then
can the divine power be passed on.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.850
Otherwise, humans cannot be saved,

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.960
and extinction would be justified.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.020
How exactly can I prove myself

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.130
to find Yuli?

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.860
Each demon tribe has passed down

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.490
a pearl that condenses
the primordial spirit.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.590
Gather all eight pearls

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.550
and the celestial mountain
and Yuli will descend for you.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:40.830
Your Majesty,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.930
drawing like this
is harmful to your health.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.800
You must stop.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.070
The deity has shown mercy,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.130
granting me power.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.600
If I don't protect humans now,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.920
what am I waiting for?

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.970
What is this?

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.620
Distribute these divine talismans
to everyone.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.560
Keep them close.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.610
If you encounter ordinary demons,

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.160
these will shield you
from their demonic power.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.480
Yes.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.780
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.070
Several guards empowered with divine power
went to patrol the mountains

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.240
and surprisingly captured a demonic beast.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.350
This is the first time we humans
have seen a demonic beast

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:24.550
without having to flee,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.150
and instead brought it back.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.160
What kind of beast is it?

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.160
An illusion beast

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.630
with no power to harm humans.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:53.510
Illusion beasts are extremely rare.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.040
They survive in the world
through illusions.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.640
Though they have little power,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.510
they can transform at will,

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.520
deceiving both demons and humans.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.500
If this demon serves us,

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.450
it will surely be beneficial.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.030
How so?

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.810
Though you have gained divine power,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.630
the power gap between you

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.640
and the many demons remains vast.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.640
Why not fight poison with poison

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.110
and use this illusion beast

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.550
to sow discord among demons?

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:55.200
Only then can we gather all pearls,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.700
proving our sincerity to the deity.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.550
Your Majesty,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.020
this is the only way
to gather all the pearls.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.830
The demons slaughter humans

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.020
using the most extreme methods.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.270
Your Majesty,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.030
you bear a deep blood feud.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:19.630
Now,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.540
you have a way to take revenge.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.920
Why are you showing mercy to the demons?

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.830
Which clan do you want to start with?

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.330
Those who most enjoyed bullying humans

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.100
were the mountain demons.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.900
Let's start with them.

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.440
Hand over the Earth Pearl

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.830
and your lives will be spared.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.560
Ridiculous!

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.960
The mountain demon tribe
has guarded this pearl for generations.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.090
You'll never get it.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.720
If all mountain demons die,

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.920
there will be no point

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.460
in guarding the pearl.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.450
Spare their lives

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.790
and I'll take you to get the Earth Pearl.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:24.310
Leader,

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.810
you can't!

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:27.870
After this disaster,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.780
our tribe no longer has the power
to guard the pearl.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.790
We must preserve some of our bloodline

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.760
to prevent complete extinction.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:39.000
Follow me.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.990
The Earth Pearl has the power of life.

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.270
One must respect all natural beings

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.800
to receive its protection.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.610
Let's go.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.410
Leader!

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.140
Dragon Lord,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.750
the Bi Fang Clan's
Wind-Settling Pearl has also been stolen.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.350
Various clans are facing trouble
one after another now.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.570
Rumors say the Ao Hen Clan
uses extremely treacherous methods.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.350
Should we also prepare
some countermeasures?

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.600
If the Dragon Lord
hadn't shown mercy before,

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.310
Ao Hen wouldn't even exist anymore.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.440
Although his reputation isn't great,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.890
he's never been this vicious before.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.980
Could it be that when you spared him
for Hong Ye's sake,

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.250
it completely disrupted Ao Hen's mind?

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.270
Though he's ruthless,

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.840
he's not one for indiscriminate killing.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.180
Besides, after the solar eclipse,

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.710
he experienced the benefits
of cultivation.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.600
He surely wouldn't act this way.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.240
I fear that while mountains
and rivers may change,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.970
one's nature remains the same.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.440
Report!

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.000
Qiong Qi's leader has brought

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.270
the leaders of Lei Meng, Fox,
Mountain Demon, and Bi Fang Clans.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.790
They're all waiting outside.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.450
Let them in.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.270
Yes.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.960
Dragon Lord,

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.480
Ao Hen's actions are disgraceful.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.880
Such a disgrace to demon-kind

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.010
must be eliminated.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.750
The Fox Clan has already suffered

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.720
multiple raids from the Ao Hen Clan.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.240
It's one thing
that our tribe is weaker than theirs,

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.350
but our repeated concessions

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.960
only made them more aggressive.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.310
They kill innocents

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.480
with vicious methods.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.030
Even after I handed over
the Thunder Pearl,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.070
they still slaughtered my people,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.800
cutting off the foundation
for future generations' cultivation!

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.250
The Mountain Demon Clan

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.270
only has a few remaining now.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:27.510
I watched helplessly

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.030
as my entire clan, including our leader,

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.350
died before my eyes!

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.750
Though there have been
conflicts between clans,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.120
none have been as ruthless as Ao Hen.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.160
Dragon Lord, since you've
achieved Azure Dragon form,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.510
if you still stand by
and do nothing like before,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.830
then you're simply enabling
the Ao Hen Clan.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.270
Indeed.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.030
That's right.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.400
The dragons cannot stand idle!

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.400
Please, Azure Dragon, help us.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.510
Please bring justice, Azure Dragon.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.790
Yes.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.370
Dragon Lord.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.290
Ao Hen ambushed my clan.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.250
You witnessed it yourself.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.610
As the Azure Dragon,

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.310
committed to protecting all beings,

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.920
surely you will be fair.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.380
We've come today

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.210
in hopes that you would lead us

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.500
to gather all clans

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.370
and punish Ao Hen together!

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.520
Punish Ao Hen!

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.350
Yes, punish him!

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.720
Yes, punish Ao Hen!

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.640
Punish Ao Hen!

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.400
Punish Ao Hen!

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.250
Though Ao Hen is powerful,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.850
he doesn't have the ability
to fight all demons at once.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.510
If he truly acts this way,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.440
it only harms others
without benefiting himself.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.480
I think

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.960
this matter is highly suspicious.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.240
Dragon Lord,

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.260
the Ao Hen Clan

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.310
has been pillaging and killing for years,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.200
constantly improving their power.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.070
They must think
that their cultivation is complete

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.070
and now, they want to rule the world.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.500
Why do you hesitate?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.090
Rumors say that Ao Hen
and the Azure Dragon

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.800
have a close relationship.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.000
Could it be

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.340
you're favoring Ao Hen?

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.840
Lei Meng.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.440
You're worried,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.920
but you shouldn't speak such nonsense.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:04.720
Otherwise,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.640
I will be the first to turn against you.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.310
Our clan is facing extinction.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.490
What do I have to fear from you?

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.130
Come on then!

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:17.950
I'm not afraid of you!

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:18.790
Stop arguing!

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.090
Punishing Ao Hen isn't difficult,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:24.110
but if there are forces behind this

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.970
stirring conflict among demons,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:28.310
wouldn't we be falling into their trap?

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.680
Everyone, return home for now.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.880
Take care of your people and treasures,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.490
and repair your barriers.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.040
I will find Ao Hen myself.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.430
Once I uncover the truth,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.610
I'll give you all an explanation.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:42.410
What if everything

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.680
truly is Ao Hen's doing?

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:49.750
I will eliminate the evil

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.840
and show no mercy.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.700
This is the first time
you've approached me on your own.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.840
I've always thought

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.920
I needed to find the Yuli Spring

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.880
and achieve immortality

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.020
before I could be with you forever.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.960
But today's chaos

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.260
has made me realize

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.250
that if I were to die one day,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.100
the only thing I would worry about

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.090
would be the bond I have with you.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.960
You're different

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.160
from before.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.310
Life is short.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.790
I can't control everything.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.080
If that's the case,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.710
what I want to do most,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.510
and the only thing I can do,

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.510
is to tell you how I feel.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.500
With a strand of my hair
representing my love,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.760
I formally ask for your hand in marriage.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.640
Will you tie your fate with mine

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.100
until the end of time?

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:04.140
Perhaps I'm being too abrupt.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.320
I'm willing.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.720
Hong Ye,

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.880
the reason I came here

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.300
was to find you.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.660
You are the very reason
of my existence here.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.050
Xiao Yao.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.540
No matter what happens in the future,

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.550
remember this:

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.350
everything I do is only

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.550
so I can stand by your side
as your equal.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.880
Between us,

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.670
there is not only equality,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.730
but also

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.990
love at first sight that lasts forever.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:41.070
Next month, August 15th,
in the human calendar

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.630
will be our wedding day.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.810
Is that alright?

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.590
Yes.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.270
That's absolutely not acceptable.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.240
How could a human
be worthy of the Azure Dragon?

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240
Yes, Dragon Lord.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:58.640
There has never been

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.750
a precedent of marriage
between demons and humans.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.200
Please reconsider, Dragon Lord.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.060
-Please reconsider, Dragon Lord!
-Please reconsider, Dragon Lord!

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.040
Dragon Lord...

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.380
If everything always followed old customs,

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.030
there would be no Azure Dragon either.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:15.760
Dragon Lord,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.640
you and Hong Ye

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.750
have only known each other
for a short time.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.440
This... things are moving too fast.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.110
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.070
Things are moving too fast.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.400
Since when has the depth of love

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.620
been measured
by the length of acquaintance?

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.100
Well...

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.040
Dragon Lord.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.000
I'm afraid a human would marry a dragon

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.640
just so they can use
the dragon clan's power

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.500
to help them find the Yuli Spring.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.350
Rumors of this spring

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.410
has now spread among all demon clans.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.550
The claim that Yuli Spring
can enhance cultivation

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.070
has caused many demons
to neglect their proper cultivation

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:46.070
and focus only on finding
the celestial mountain.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.070
I suspect the Ao Hen Clan
keeps stirring up trouble

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.350
and killing other demons

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.210
must be connected to this matter.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.200
With many issues unresolved
among the demon clans,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.800
everyone is waiting for you
to uphold justice.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.790
If you marry a human at this time,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.830
it will likely cause unease
among all clans.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.150
Yes, Dragon Lord.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.270
If the Dragon Lord doesn't marry Hong Ye,

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:08.000
will everyone
stop seeking the Yuli Spring?

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.670
Long Yu!

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.010
Since becoming the Azure Dragon,

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.440
our Lord has settled disputes
and protected the weak,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.400
never indulging in luxury,

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:17.320
and never acting arrogantly toward anyone.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.230
From great demons

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.190
down to the flowers and grass,

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.989
she treats all with utmost care.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.960
Just for Long Zhi's tribulation,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.770
she put in tremendous effort.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.030
In my opinion,

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.400
the Dragon Lord
has never done anything harmful to demons,

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.199
so we should trust her decision.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.630
Secondly, speaking of status,

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.440
no one ranks higher than the Azure Dragon.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.880
You surely don't intend to use status
to restrict the Dragon Lord

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.230
and condemn her
to lifelong solitude, right?

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.630
Well...

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.070
I...

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.139
Marriage matters

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.230
are ultimately
the Dragon Lord's personal affair.

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.510
Even if Hong Ye is unworthy,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.320
it's only a matter of a hundred years,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.960
which has almost no impact for demons

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.270
and the Dragon Lord.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.190
If she can't even make
a hundred-year decision for herself,

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.320
then that's no fun.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.320
In the future,

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.650
who would want to become the Azure Dragon?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.160
Rest assured, everyone.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.060
I haven't forgotten my duties
as the Azure Dragon.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.510
I, Xiao Yao, promise

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.280
that before the wedding,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.210
I will resolve all issues
affecting the demon clans.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.150
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.710
Yao,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.500
you've finally come to see me.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.480
Drinking alone?

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.110
It's not as good
as what I gave you before.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.700
If you hadn't come,

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.570
I wouldn't have brought out
those good wines at all.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.090
I've come to see you

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.050
to borrow the Mist Pearl again.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.180
You lost Hong Ye again?

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.280
This is a sacred treasure
of your entire clan,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.280
yet you carry it around so casually.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.090
If I carry it with me,

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.440
then it's my responsibility.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.960
If I didn't keep it with me,

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.630
then it would be
the entire clan's responsibility.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.580
I don't even consider it a treasure,

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.840
so being casual about it doesn't matter.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:34.840
Wait.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.910
Let me stand further away

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960
before you start.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.360
I don't want to see Hong Ye's face.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.770
I'm not here to find him.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.590
The Ao Hen Clan
has gained notoriety lately,

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.290
but I've searched everywhere
and couldn't find him.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.370
I want to see

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.880
if he's hiding because he truly fears

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.940
that I'll kill him.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.330
If he really did those things,

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.370
he should know hiding is useless.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:09.570
I, Ao Hen,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.800
never care about my reputation.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.760
But when I heard that several major clans

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.970
went to the Dragon Lord
to address the situation,

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:19.630
I was actually quite pleased.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.170
Clearing the undeserved infamy

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.280
of the Ao Hen Clan

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.840
wouldn't be a bad thing.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:26.720
But I never expected

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.960
that even the Dragon Lord
who protects all beings

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.490
would believe such rumors.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.870
If it weren't for finding out the truth,

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.200
I wouldn't be
the only one looking for you.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.550
If I say I didn't do it,

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.910
would you believe me?

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.150
Then at least tell me

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.840
where you were during those days,

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840
what you did,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.270
and who can verify it.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.080
I have nothing to say.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:56.070
Various clans have lost their pearls

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.630
and countless lives have been lost.

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.090
The demon world
has never been in such chaos.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.440
If you truly didn't do it,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.190
you should join everyone

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.390
to work together and uncover the truth.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.750
The Ao Hen Clan wasn't attacked.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.780
Our Universe Pearl is untouched.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.860
Why should I care about other clans?

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.780
My affairs

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.070
are none of your business.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.590
If you refuse to cooperate,

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.280
then I'll have to take you back
to the Dragon Palace

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.340
to deal with later.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:25.960
Wait!

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.250
I can vouch for him.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.510
This really wasn't Ao Hen's doing.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.320
Shut up!

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.070
At a time like this,

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.150
you're still worried about your pride?

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.760
Yao,

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.800
since you took Hong Ye
away from Mount Yangxu,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.960
he's been here every day,

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.550
feeling both ashamed and sorrowful.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:41.190
He's been taking me

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:42.960
to drink heavily in this forest.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.920
Teng She, stop talking!

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.000
He had no time to steal pearls!

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.070
Xiao Yao and I

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.290
went from enemies to friends.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.670
Now, because of a human,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.510
she hates me.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.510
What's so special
about that Hong Ye anyway?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.480
Has the world changed?

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.570
Isn't might supposed to make right?

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.760
Right?

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.240
I don't understand.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.760
I regret it too.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.840
Tell me,

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.160
should I go apologize to Xiao Yao

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.080
and beg for her forgiveness?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.320
Say something!

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.400
Yes!

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.110
No.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.920
I shouldn't.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.080
I, Ao Hen, am full of pride and dignity.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:34.920
I'm harsh to others

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.070
and even harsher to myself.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.590
Even when facing death...

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.960
I will never lose my composure.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.780
Yes...

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360
Serves you right.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.760
I, Ao Hen, swear to heaven.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320
From now on,

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:57.840
if I ever wrong Xiao Yao...

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.920
May I be struck by lightning.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.840
When he made that vow,

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.030
the sky was clear,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.590
with no lightning in sight.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.480
It proves that

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.030
he was sincere.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.610
I believe what you said.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.360
But this way,

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.440
things are even worse.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.150
See,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.690
Yao still believes you.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.500
She may believe me,

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.940
but I've lost all dignity now.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.150
Then let's

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.230
find out the truth together.
