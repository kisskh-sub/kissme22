WEBVTT

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.400
Secretary Lin

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:23.439
You just...

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:24.959
I'm sorry.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.480
I never thought Secretary Lin

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.560
had a time like that.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680
You're still living at Manager Liu's place?

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.759
Once this job is over,

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.960
I'll move back.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.719
The chairman's son,

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.919
working as someone else's secretary.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.680
And living in an employee's home.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.520
How ridiculous that sounds.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.599
Are you a hermit crab?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.759
If you don't want to come back, fine.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.879
But moving back to that old place...

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.240
You're still a child.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.719
It's okay to take a few more detours.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.560
Your father and I

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.360
really hope you'll come back

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.479
to help the company.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.879
A twenty-eight-year-old child.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.800
How novel.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.319
Why is it that all the novel things

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.080
happen to our family?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.560
Two sons. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.039
One a great artist,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.120
one a hopeless romantic.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.960
How did you give birth so well?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.439
If I'd known you were so good at it,

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.159
back then, despite the pressure,

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.080
we should have had a few more.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.319
Had a whole platoon of them.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.039
Stop talking. Shut up.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.240
I don't see it as a detour.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.639
These years assisting President Qin with Qin Corp

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.599
have actually taught me a lot.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.919
But if Lin Corp

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.080
needs my help,

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:17.840
As for the price...

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.000
What do you mean 'your help'?

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.319
You silly child.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.000
If it weren't for you two being disobedient,

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.719
your father would have retired long ago.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.199
Long time no see,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.560
my dear brother.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.240
So,

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.960
how does it feel to be once again

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.400
the only healthy and outstanding son in this family?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.960
How does it feel?

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.199
I find it strange.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960
How you never tire

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.040
of saying such boring things.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.959
Don't you want to know

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.160
why your little girlfriend

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.319
left you?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.399
Who introduced her to that fake rich guy?

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.079
It was her.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.360
I'll give you five hundred thousand first.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:40.600
After it's done,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.120
the rest goes to your account.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.040
Okay.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.879
Lin Han.

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:53.079
I came to give you closure.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:54.680
We...

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.759
Let's break up.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.480
I need diamond rings,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.680
luxury cars, designer bags.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.120
These are things a secretary like you can't give me.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.040
You don't care?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.920
Why should I care about

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.199
someone without sincerity?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.879
On the contrary,

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.720
I should thank you for your painstaking effort

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.399
in helping me filter out

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.519
such an unworthy person.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.240
My brother has grown up.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.800
Thanks to you.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.160
I grew up when I was seven.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.439
Talking to someone as shameless, boring,

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.879
and incompetent as you

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.959
is a real waste of time.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.360
If I were you,

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.519
I'd spend my precious time

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.199
on more worthwhile things.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.319
Go in, friends!

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.480
Join the team fight, dude!

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:50.800
I'm sorry.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.399
The subscriber you dialed

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.560
is temporarily unavailable.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.560
Calling a subordinate

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.480
in the dead of night on a weekend.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.920
Is this lady out of her mind?

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.920
I'm sorry.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.519
The subscriber you dialed

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.800
is temporarily unavailable.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.439
Please try again later.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.319
Hello, Secretary Lin?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.399
You need to quickly check

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:37.879
Secretary Xue's emergency contacts.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.279
She might be in danger.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.759
What?

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.000
What happened?

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:42.879
Don't panic yet.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.480
I sent her a message an hour ago,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.720
and got no reply.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.680
Just now I called,

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680
and it was actually hung up.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.319
When I called again, no one answered.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.680
Could it be...

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.560
Could she have been kidnapped?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.519
President Qin,

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.199
no employee waits by their phone

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.600
at three-thirty in the morning

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.319
to answer their boss's call.

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.560
Is that...

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.040
so?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.160
Yes.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.040
But you would.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.279
But...

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.319
why didn't you

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.839
let me accompany you?

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.839
Because you said

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.439
you wanted to live your own life.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.399
You shouldn't take words like that to heart.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.279
I'll go with you tomorrow.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:34.440
Secretary Lin.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.600
I'm listening.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.240
Please, really forget all that.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.279
All that talk about begging you

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.600
to marry me or date me...

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.360
It's all so embarrassing.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:48.559
Let's just pretend none of it happened.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.440
You are still just my

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.440
dear secretary.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.480
This is that missing painting, Paradise.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.559
The colors are delicate,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.879
warm and full of vitality.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:28.279
The brushstrokes are passionate and unrestrained,

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.279
yet they don't lack strength.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:30.799
Every stroke

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:32.879
seems like an outpouring of the painter's emotions.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:36.360
This must be

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.600
the latest work by the hottest painter

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.679
right now, Mofei.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:39.840
Mofei?

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.200
Mofei is...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.279
It's me.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:48.960
So you are Mofei.

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.240
Indeed.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.480
I'm glad Miss Qin appreciates art.

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.480
And this is?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.200
This is Secretary Lin.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.480
Mr. Mo, you know me?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.440
We met once, many years ago.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.200
Really?

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.120
When was that?

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.720
President Qin,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.919
the Business Department just sent a message...

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:11.799
Oh, right, Mr. Mo.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.039
Our company happens to be

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.759
launching a batch of Artist Collaborations.

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.399
I wonder if you'd be interested?

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.519
I'm certainly interested,

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:18.679
Miss Qin.

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:20.120
You can just call me Mofei from now on.

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:21.600
That's wonderful.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:22.600
Secretary Lin,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.600
inform the Business Department

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.720
to add Mr. Mo to the collaboration list.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.919
President Qin,

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.080
we haven't gone through an evaluation yet.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.519
I recall you were abroad before.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.399
May I ask how long

00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:33.200
you plan to stay this time?

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.679
Our company has a New Product Launch

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.919
next month.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.600
Would you have time to attend?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.879
I came back this time

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:40.080
just to take a vacation.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:41.360
I won't be leaving anytime soon.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.080
Of course,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.879
if

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.440
Miss Qin invites me,

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:45.879
I can appear anytime.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.320
President Qin,

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.159
At our new product launch,

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:48.759
Mr. Mo,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.600
I remember you had a painting before...

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.120
President Qin,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.200
I'll wait for you outside.

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:54.639
Secretary Lin?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.000
Secretary Lin!

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.320
What's going on?

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:03.399
Secretary Lin might be angry.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.960
No way.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.360
He's never

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.720
acted out before.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.000
Maybe it's because you were too enthusiastic with me.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.039
He's jealous.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:16.559
Jealous?

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:26.080
Come with me.
