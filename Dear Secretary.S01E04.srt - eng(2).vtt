00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.359
Marriage proposal

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.000
How can you even drink this cheap booze?

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:20.640
It's not even strong, it's fine.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.239
Cheap booze.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.760
As in low-quality.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.159
Drink it if you like it, or get lost.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:27.840
Alright, alright, I'll drink it.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.359
So?

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.799
Did he say yes?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, he didn't exactly refuse me.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:06.599
Secretary Lin.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.439
What is it, boss?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.360
You haven't answered my question yet.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.560
You mean...

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:15.840
Currently, I...

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.599
have no plans to get married.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.759
Don't worry about not being good enough for me.

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:27.639
I don't care about that.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.639
*I* care.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.800
You...

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.439
care about me?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.840
No, boss.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.199
What I mean is...

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.159
A woman as perfect as you...

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.039
should be with an even more perfect man.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.960
I'm really not suitable.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.879
Qin Meili.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.680
That's a rejection.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.560
A one hundred percent rejection.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.360
But he said I'm perfect.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.120
Sis.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.439
Do you think anyone would say...

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.960
that their own boss is crazy?

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.000
And I think...

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.479
you're really quite twisted.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.479
To keep Secretary Lin...

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.919
by your side forever...

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.560
you'd resort to a trick like marriage.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.800
What else can I do?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.719
Who told him to be the most...

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:09.240
all-around secretary I've ever seen?

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:10.960
Let me tell you.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.719
Only someone that capable...

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.520
is worthy of me.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.800
Qin Meili's high-intensity work...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.680
But...

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.639
He really did reject me.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.120
It's pretty obvious.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:26.520
Then why did he say...

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.960
he wants to be my husband?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.879
What?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.719
Who said you're not suitable?

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.520
Boss, your foot...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.400
has been fine for a while.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.039
The doctor said...

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.120
there's nothing wrong.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.039
I was just pretending...

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.639
so you'd take care of me.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.520
But why?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.599
Because you've been with me...

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.800
like a shadow for three years.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.400
We even spend holidays together.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.759
The time we spend together...

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.080
could be said to be more than a married couple.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.599
But a husband and a secretary...

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.479
are still different, President Qin.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.039
But if you marry me...

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.560
you can start a new life...

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.199
and still be my secretary.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.199
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.240
I really don't want to be your secretary anymore.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.040
So...

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.839
He said he doesn't want to be my secretary.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.879
Doesn't that mean he wants to be my husband?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.240
You really are a logical genius.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.720
I'm speechless.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.600
I've never seen a narcissist like you.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:32.399
Good thing Secretary Lin didn't agree.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.959
Otherwise, he'd be your workhorse for life.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:34.920
That's too tragic.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.199
Inhumane.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.800
Why can't I...

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.439
marry him because I like him?

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.360
Do you like him?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.079
Hey, Secretary Lin.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.120
Come pick me up.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.839
Boss...

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.040
It's 2:30 in the morning.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.639
The employee work schedule...

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.600
starts at 6:30.

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:25.959
Living hell.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:26.480
I quit.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.639
I quit right now.

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.680
Where are you going so late?

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:35.879
That smile of yours...

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.240
is really creepy.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.319
Tell me...

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.040
what kind of person makes an employee...

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.240
get up for work at 2:30 AM?

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.040
Definitely not a human.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.720
It's definitely a beast.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.480
A cruel, heartless...

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.920
and inhumane beast.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.959
Well said.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:56.560
High five.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.040
Hey, Hanzi.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.360
Where exactly are we now?

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.040
My back...

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.120
feels strangely cold.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.720
Slow down

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.759
Watch your head

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.439
How much did he drink?

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.160
To get like this?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160
Hanzi, what's going on?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.480
I'm not drunk.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.839
No, this...

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:27.399
He's drunk.

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.879
Not drunk.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.839
Why is it you?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.199
You know each other?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.399
More than just know.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.240
Meili.

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:38.000
Look at this face.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.439
This person is our...

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.959
Selfish, cringey, greasy, and unlucky...

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:42.800
And prostatitis-suffering man-child ex-husband.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:44.800
Mr. Ex.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.839
Hanzi.

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.000
Let me introduce her to you.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.759
This one...

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.480
Is our sarcastic, mean, scheming, black-hearted...

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.720
Who only cares about fame and fortune...

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.839
And doesn't care if others live or die...

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.920
Ex-wife.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.600
Seems like lately you've been...

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.720
Not doing too well.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.959
Before I saw you...

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.439
I was doing great.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.079
Don't tell me...

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.600
You two talk.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
We're leaving first.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.120
You're already divorced.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.000
What son do you have?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.800
Who had a son with you?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.279
Let me tell you, my son's meals must be top-notch.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.120
At least four dishes a day.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.639
Got it?

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.120
Shut up, you.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.879
Didn't I say I'd hit you...

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:11.439
Every time I see you?

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.279
I'll really do it.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.199
You dare try, just you try.

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.199
What are you doing?

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.720
Go on, hit me!

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.639
Shrew!

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.199
No, you...

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.439
Secretary Lin.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.879
Darn it.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.920
I'll hit you, I...

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:40.560
Don't you leave!

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.240
You stand there and let me hit you!

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.279
Stop hitting!

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.920
I'll beat you to death today!

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.839
Secretary Lin.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.399
Get married.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:02.279
Let's get married.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.360
If we marry, you won't have to resign.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.839
Secretary Lin.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.960
Marry.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:35.919
Marry.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.240
Secretary Lin, marry.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.720
Secretary Lin.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:08.480
Son.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:09.879
You should still come with me.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.399
I'll guarantee you a life of luxury.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.200
And after you're with me...

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.240
All your things...

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.720
I will all...

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.080
What is that?

00:10:19.679 --> 00:10:20.679
What, what?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.720
No, you, this...

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.600
So early in the morning...

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:24.240
Up so early?

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.159
I didn't wake up early.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.559
I didn't sleep.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.440
I love to drink.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.639
But my tolerance isn't great.

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:33.559
You could say it's a...

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.600
Small flaw in my perfect life.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.200
But a flaw can't hide the jade's beauty.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.519
You must be ready to take me home anytime.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.799
Of course.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:42.000
Men and women are different.

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.960
Changing clothes won't be necessary.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.159
Also...

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.000
I have high standards for skincare.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.039
So...

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.159
You must remove my makeup for me.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.159
Wash my face, apply serum, night cream.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:56.559
Oh, and also...

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.320
Don't forget to put a glass of honey water by my bedside.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.559
Do you understand everything?

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:08.720
Didn't sleep, huh?

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:11.000
Then you should have some coffee.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:13.399
So what was it, really?

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.039
I already said it's nothing.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:16.919
Hey, no...

00:11:16.919 --> 00:11:17.720
Wait a minute.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.320
That thing you just mentioned...

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.200
And then?

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.720
Don't tell me you, you punk...

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.519
Of course not.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:29.679
Absolutely.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.440
You promise?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.799
I swear.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.639
Secretary Lin.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.000
Secretary Lin.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.399
Marry.

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.240
Be a man.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.360
Fine.

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:57.919
Then let's have coffee.

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:58.679
I'll wash.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.120
I'm going to take a shower.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.320
That thing isn't there either.
