(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
(Xie Siyun
Concubine of Shen Family)

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560
After all this fuss,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.560
Madam must be starving.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.480
Bring her something nice to eat!

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.740
(Shen Yaochu
Eldest Daughter of Shen Family)

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.150
Come at me instead!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.350
Don't touch my mother!

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.350
Xie Siyun.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.430
Even if my mom dies,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.000
my father will marry someone else.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.000
You'll never become the rightful wife!

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.710
Ah, I almost forgot.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.710
You mustn't get hurt.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.590
You still have to be married off.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.550
Nanny Liu.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.070
Mother!

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.550
Stop!

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.070
Mother!

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.240
Eat it!

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.130
Mother!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.990
Eat it now!

(Shen Yunxi
Second daughter of Shen Family)

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.310
Eat it.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.560
Will you marry him or not?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.520
I will...

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.300
See, if you had

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.740
(Shen Yaochu's Birth Mother)
said that earlie,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.560
your mother wouldn't have to suffer.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.710
General Li achieved great merit.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.470
Marrying him as the rightful wife

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.240
is the greatest blessing for you.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.080
But he's already dead.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.080
You simply wish

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.080
to send me to the grave after him.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.710
Refuse the marriage,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800
and she will be the one who dies.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.200
Xie Siyun.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.470
You've done every wicked deed...

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.680
Aren't you afraid of karma?

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.910
Karma?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.190
There's only one rule in this world.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.430
Either your hand is on my throat,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.590
or mine is on yours.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.400
Don't blame me for playing dirty,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.400
but your own fragile neck.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.000
The auspicious hour is near.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.080
Prepare the young lady's attire.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.120
Xie Siyun.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.910
If anything happens to my mother,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.710
I will never let you off the hook!

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.240
Mother.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.790
Father doesn't know about this yet.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.310
That's the point, we must send

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.000
that vixen away while he's away.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.960
But no need to be so tense.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.520
When has he ever cared for them?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.430
True enough.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.750
But if Shen Yaochu seizes power

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.590
in the Li family,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.520
-Power?
-We...

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.190
Do you think that girl

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.680
can survive tonight?

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.060
(Joyful)

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.560
Midnight approaches.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.800
Today, the Guardian General

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.240
Li Jingchuan, son of
the Marquis of Anding,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.910
returns in spirit

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.840
to wed Shen Yaochu, the Prefecture
Governor's eldest daughter.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.180
(Harmony Brings Auspiciousness)

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.310
Though the wedding is at midnight,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.590
I haven't treated you unfairly.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.070
Look at your crown and bridal robe.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.480
Send my mom to Guanyin Nunnery,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.920
and I'll marry him.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.870
If you cross the Li family,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.830
my father won't be lenient.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320
Fine.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.270
I'll send her there tomorrow.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.080
Right now.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.950
At a time like this,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.390
you're still bargaining with me?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.160
It's exactly because of the timing

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.160
that you have no time to think

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.240
of a countermeasure, right?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.880
Lady Siyun,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.830
the auspicious hour is near.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.800
The Li family's wedding procession

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.230
is arriving as well.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.270
The couple bound in fate
shall stand together.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.920
May this life be lived without regrets.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.830
May their souls rest together in peace.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.030
Alright.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.040
I'll send her off right now.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.310
I need to see my mom leave.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Shen Yaochu,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.000
do not harbor thoughts you shouldn't.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.120
You know what I mean.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.430
Even if I spare her life,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.070
I can make her wish she weren't alive.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.240
Stop wasting time.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.600
The time is near.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.120
I wish you and General Li

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.920
a harmonious union.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.000
And a swift reunion.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.230
Lady Siyun,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.560
you want me buried with him?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.430
Then why don't we die together?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.030
Madam!

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.790
Mother!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.710
Guards! Guards!

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.670
A murderer!

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.170
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.870
I'm Shen Yaochu, widow of General Li.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.360
Lady Siyun is stopping me.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.600
General, please help me!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.160
-Shen Yaochu!
- Mother...

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.630
When have I ever stopped you?

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.560
Thank you, General.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.880
And you are...?

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.920
I am Xu Shan, Deputy
General under General Li.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.440
Deputy General Xu.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.920
Lady Siyun is stopping me.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.270
She wants me to marry other.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.800
I risked my life to escape.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.830
Please, General, take me away from here.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.830
I never stopped you!

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.880
It was clearly you!

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.190
How come you're so devoted

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.270
to General Li?

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.110
Of course.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.000
Years ago, I had
the honor of meeting him.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.750
Since then, he's never left my thoughts.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.600
General Li sacrificed himself.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.000
I've admired him deeply.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.510
Even though he's gone,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.160
I'd still marry his memorial

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.480
tablet willingly.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.320
You've met him?

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.160
Of course I have.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.760
Shen Yaochu,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.270
you're slandering me!

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.830
It was you who schemed to harm me!

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.190
So now, will you let me marry or not?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.750
Of course, the marriage shall proceed.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.750
Take me away.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.280
It looks like rain.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.390
Then please, Madam,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.200
step into the sedan.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.550
The auspicious hour has come!

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.750
Madam, please step into the sedan chair.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.460
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.150
(When I reach the Li Manor,)

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.800
(Late Guardian General Li Jingchuan)
(I might be buried alongside General Li.)

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.470
(Now,)

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.360
(I still don't know if Mother is safe.)

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.870
(I cannot die.)

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.480
(If Lady Siyun takes
this chance to harm her,)

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.030
(all my efforts today would be in vain.)

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.680
(I must live.)

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.040
Deputy General Xu.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.440
What is it, Madam?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.510
Please come closer for a word.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.530
Madam?

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:17.550
It's my old ailment.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.840
I need the master at Guanyin
Nunnery to treat me.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.750
Please, change our route
and take me there first.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.240
I'll summon a physician here instead.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.670
Madam, please wait just a moment.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.480
Madam, what is this for?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.270
Change the course to Guanyin Nunnery.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.510
Why go there?

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.720
I have my own reasons I cannot avoid.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.550
You're bold indeed.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.550
What I've done today,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.960
you've seen it all clearly.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.480
So I won't need to hide.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.080
It's not Lady Siyun who was
stopping your marriage,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.600
but you didn't wish to wed.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.110
Change the course.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.440
Head to Guanyin Nunnery.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.550
Now that's interesting.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.480
I've made arrangements at the nunnery.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.510
Tonight,

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.870
be the bride you're meant to be.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.990
