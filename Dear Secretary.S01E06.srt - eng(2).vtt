WEBVTT

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.799
Three hundred

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.079
Three hundred and one

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:18.760
Hanzi

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.359
I've been feeling really weak lately.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.920
Working for Ms. Qin

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.519
must be exhausting, huh?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.000
Get lost.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.120
A 24/7 corporate slave life.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.159
Anyone would be worn out.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.840
It's been three years.

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.480
Remember Vanka from the elementary school textbook?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.760
I've been a bonded laborer for three years.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.640
Finally, I see a glimmer of hope.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.439
What goes around comes around.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.000
Heaven spares no one.

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:55.439
This is retribution.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.680
Retribution.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.359
What are you talking about?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.000
Nothing.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.719
Um...

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.640
Ms. Qin...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.799
Is she willing to let you go?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.560
I don't know either.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.759
But the good thing is,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.120
she hasn't bothered me these past two days.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.639
That's good.

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.840
She actually hasn't summoned me for two whole days.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.759
So you really...

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.159
don't like me?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.800
I don't.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.919
Hanzi!

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.719
Lin Hai is back.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.000
And...

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.000
Talk tonight.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.879
Come home for dinner.

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.759
Chairman Lin's orders.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.080
Hurry up.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.080
Hurry, hurry!

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.840
This counts as burglary, doesn't it?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.280
I must be crazy.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.879
Spending a weekend acting insane with you.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.719
The locks for this house

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.599
were all bought by me personally.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.479
How can this be considered...

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.680
Quick, quick, quick!

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.360
Keep your voice down.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.159
Stop.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.919
Hurry.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.199
Looks like the code hasn't changed.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.479
Tofu!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.599
Tofu!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.039
Tofu!

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.400
Tofu!

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.120
You go that way.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.879
I'll go this way.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.039
Tofu!

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.520
Tofu!

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.919
My little Tofu!

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.280
Weren't my slam dunks just awesome?

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.479
Alright.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.879
I heard your brother is back this time

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.520
to hold a painting exhibition.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.199
I don't know about that.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.279
Don't tell me.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.000
I think...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.560
Actually, between you two brothers,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.399
you could be a little...

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.439
What was that sound?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.959
Grab it, grab it!

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:30.759
Take it!

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.480
Go, go, go!

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.680
You...

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.360
You, you, you...

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.680
What are you d-doing?

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.279
How come after the divorce,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480
you quit being a doctor

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.639
and switched to theft?

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.000
Theft?

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:49.759
Are you insane?

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:50.480
I'm entering my own home.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.160
How is that theft?

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.759
*Your* home?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.399
We agreed during the divorce,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.519
this house is mine.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.519
How did it become *your* home?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.000
Fine, the house is yours.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.360
Then Tofu is mine, right?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.920
Tofu is because you claimed him for yourself.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.160
You didn't give me visitation rights.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.519
I haven't even complained.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.279
You... you want visitation rights?

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.399
Are you worthy?

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.519
How did you carry him for ten months and give birth?

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.079
How can you still be so mean?

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.759
Not at all.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:14.560
I'm not... what?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.600
Secretary Lin.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.120
Let me tell you,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.360
men, you're really disgusting.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.360
Just shut up.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.160
If you're going to say that,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.639
you, you, you...

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.160
What?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.279
I'll say it.

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.920
So what?

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:22.560
Let's talk inside.

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:23.560
You shut up.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.240
Hi, Secretary Lin.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.600
Get out.

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.480
Sorry about that.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.199
Secretary Lin.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.040
Bye, Secretary Lin.

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:13.279
They're arguing their way to the bed again.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.319
Yeah.

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:15.959
Same as always.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.040
Today is the weekend.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.000
Right.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.600
It is the weekend.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:24.600
The weather is nice today.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.399
Boss.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.159
Just forget it all.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.159
Forget about Secretary Lin too.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.000
Forget about today.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:52.279
Secretary Lin today...

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.320
forget about him too.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.080
You can't forget, can you?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.840
You can't forget Secretary Lin either, right?

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.480
Mom

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:53.960
Your son is home.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.799
You must be tired. Come inside.

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:00.039
In my lifetime...

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:01.879
...to see my eldest son again.

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.399
I'm truly blessed.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.120
Dad.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.600
Life as an artist treating you well?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.679
Not bad.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:11.639
Before your work becomes immortal...

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:13.639
...you still remember your aging parents.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.879
Such a filial son.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.759
The Virtuous Artist indeed.

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.639
Great artist.

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.440
Dad's still talking like that.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.159
Yeah.

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:25.960
Come on, son.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.960
Your dad's all bark and no bite.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.360
Don't mind his sarcasm.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.080
He actually knew you were coming back.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.440
He's been happy about it for a week.

00:10:41.159 --> 00:10:42.039
Hey, old man.

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:44.120
If you want to see your son, come out.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.360
Stop eavesdropping.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.000
Mom.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:56.120
Lin Han.

00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:57.919
Still working as a secretary?

00:10:58.559 --> 00:10:59.360
Still am.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:02.039
Back then, for that girl...

00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:03.679
...you ran away from home for independence.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.360
Then I heard you got dumped.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.279
Your father found out.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.919
He told him to return to the Lin Family immediately.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.480
He said he'd come back later.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:14.960
I suppose it's my fault.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:16.759
I raised the child...

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.240
...to be too responsible.

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:19.720
Mom.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:22.080
Little brother has always been outstanding.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:23.559
I think...

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.279
...he must have his own plans.

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:27.080
A bit willful, perhaps...

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:28.639
...but he's a good kid.

00:11:28.919 --> 00:11:30.279
Very reliable.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.679
Your father's and my greatest pride...

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.879
...is having you two sons.

00:11:56.039 --> 00:11:57.039
Come home soon.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.679
Your older brother is already back.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.399
It's a must.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.200
Don't even think of making excuses.

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:03.440
At the very least...

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.120
...let your dad and me, in our lifetime...

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.559
...see the whole family reunited.

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:09.600
I understand.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.720
Looks like they won't...

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.480
...be done anytime soon.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.279
I have something to attend to. I should go.

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.320
I was just about to leave too.

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:20.759
Let me give you a ride. It's on my way.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.480
Alright.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.639
What's wrong with this elevator?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.639
Hello? The elevator is broken.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.039
We're trapped inside.

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:13.200
Please come fix it.

00:13:13.519 --> 00:13:14.320
Okay, copy that.

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:15.200
Wait for our rescue.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.120
Darn it. What a piece of junk.

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:22.639
Are you okay, Secretary Lin?

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:23.240
What's wrong?

00:13:23.639 --> 00:13:24.440
Secretary Lin?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Secretary Lin!

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.639
What's the matter with you?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.799
Don't go.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.159
Don't go.

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:33.679
Don't go.

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:35.480
I'm not going.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.639
I'm right here.
