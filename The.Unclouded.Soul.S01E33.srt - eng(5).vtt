[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 33]

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.610
Time-Reversal Array.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.530
What are you doing?

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.410
With our combined power,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.550
we can send you back 10,000 years

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.180
to see with your own eyes

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.660
what really happened then

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.430
and make your choice again.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.490
Stop this.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.920
Even if I choose 1,000 or 10,000 times,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.310
I would still choose Hong Ye.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.070
Sister,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.490
even if

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.100
you don't like me,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.810
you absolutely cannot
make the wrong choice.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.600
Don't worry,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.370
with our three people's power,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.100
we can ensure your safe return.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.780
Once you understand the truth of the past,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.640
you will understand our actions.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.390
Absolutely not!

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.730
The last time Xiao Yao
entered time reversal,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.570
even going back a mere 100 years

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.900
was extremely dangerous,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.060
and she barely made it back.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.190
We cannot let her take this risk again.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.740
Hong Ye,

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.300
if the three of us
joined forces to kill you,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.630
it would be effortless.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.870
But the truth from 10,000 years ago

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.110
must not remain hidden.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.530
Xiao Yao,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.940
if you learn the truth of the past

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.600
and still want to protect him,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.740
you can use the method
from 10,000 years ago

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.020
to seal me again.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.300
I will respect your choice.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.130
We'll stake our lives

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.200
to grant you clarity.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.130
Do you dare?

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.460
How can I

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.900
trust your words?

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.970
Hong Ye!

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:31.490
Teng She.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.940
Sister,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.620
I've always

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.680
been the most obedient to you.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.740
Today, I'm begging you.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.290
Go back 10,000 years and see.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.940
I just made a blood oath.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.180
Heaven and earth bear witness.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.620
If there's even a hint of falsehood,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.550
if I have any intention to harm you,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.670
may I, Teng She,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.850
be utterly annihilated.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.470
Seeing your attitude,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.180
if we don't resolve these past grudges,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.420
you won't let this go.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.200
Since this is a personal grudge,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.260
I have a condition.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.660
Go ahead.

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:33.860
Before I return,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.210
you must ensure

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.370
Hong Ye and Demons' Valley remain safe.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.730
If humans attack,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.659
protecting Demons' Valley
must be your priority.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.450
Okay.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.659
Okay.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.940
Okay.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.300
In that case,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.520
I'll go seek a resolution.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.860
Otherwise, this constant trouble

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.260
will never give us peace.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.430
I only ask that you return safely.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.230
Don't worry,

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.500
I still want to eat
the noodles you make every day.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.500
Xiao Yao,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.240
no matter what you see,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.500
my love for you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.330
will never change.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.450
Xiao Yao, why did you come here?

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.690
Go back.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.830
Go back now.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.340
What exactly happened
10,000 years ago?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.980
The truth is more than you can bear.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.460
You'll regret seeing it.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.460
If I'm powerless,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.700
I'll pray to the gods.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.100
If I'm powerful,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.909
I'll slay all demons in my path!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.510
[10,000 years ago]

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.740
Where am I?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.540
Real gold.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.570
What was I 10,000 years ago?

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.140
At least I was wealthy in this life.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.070
Xiao Yao, why have you gotten poorer?

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.300
This...

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.060
Looks quite impressive.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.810
I wonder what my power is like.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.300
I'm so powerful!

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:40.850
Hong Ye?

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:43.539
Hong Ye!

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.520
What's wrong with you?

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.580
You...

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.300
Hong Ye, wake up.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.420
Hong Ye!

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.260
Hong Ye!

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:56.460
You're awake.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.850
Hong Ye.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:02.610
Demon.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.090
Demon.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.740
I'm Xiao Yao.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:06.780
Stay back.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.390
Don't come closer.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.180
Stay away!

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.180
Why are you acting like this?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.580
I just saved your life.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.870
Listen carefully,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.970
I would rather die

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.270
than surrender!

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.060
If you want to eat a corpse,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.420
then come at me!

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.570
Put the sword...

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.060
Don't move!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.850
I won't move.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.520
Why would I want to eat you?

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.870
Because you're a demon!

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.540
We humans have been repeatedly

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.780
enslaved and bullied by
you demons in this chaotic world.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.070
You've lost count of

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.900
how many you've eaten yourself,
haven't you?

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.810
How could everything have been reversed?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.320
If Hong Ye was human,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.530
how did he become the Demon King?

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:56.890
And where did

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.240
his power come from?

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.570
I won't hurt you.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:07.540
If I wanted to eat you,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.140
I would have done so already.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.550
Did you really save me?

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.020
Yes.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.550
If that's the case,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.570
may I leave now?

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:24.730
Fine.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.580
Wait.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.220
Could you tell me

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.730
your name

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.960
and where you live?

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.420
So you want to use me as bait

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.300
to find more people.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.120
Why do you think of me as so wicked?

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.780
Fine.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.610
Come closer,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.330
and I'll tell you.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.900
You just resemble someone I once knew,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.180
so I wanted to talk with you a bit more.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.270
I never intended to harm you.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.160
[Long Zhi]

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.530
Hong Ye!

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:03.490
Xiao Yao!

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.660
-Dragon Lord.
-Dragon Lord.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.390
Dragon Lord.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.850
Xiao Yao.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.330
You've successfully
passed the tribulation.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.390
That's wonderful!

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.180
You've attained the true form
of the Azure Dragon.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.850
From now on, our dragon clan shall
stand proudly among the universe.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.180
So Azure Dragons really do exist.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:20.900
Yes, indeed.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.430
Xiao Yao,

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.020
you're truly a role model
for our dragon clan.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.690
Xiao Yao,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.090
that skill you just showed

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.150
was truly amazing.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.140
Yes.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.570
Dragon clan?

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.320
Then who are you?

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.690
I'm Long Zhi.

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.140
What are you talking about?

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.540
My head hurts a bit.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.490
Apart from my name,

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.290
I can't remember anything else.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.820
You don't remember?

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.060
Well, some get injured, maimed,

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.020
or even die
passing the heavenly tribulation,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.880
but this is the first time
I've heard of memory loss.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.430
Do you have any other discomfort?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.380
No, no.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.260
I see.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.570
The heavenly tribulation is perilous.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.540
Some mishaps

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.830
are inevitable.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.940
After we finish our business,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.140
whatever you want to know,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.470
I'll tell you everything when we get back.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.610
Congratulations, Dragon Lord,
on overcoming your heavenly tribulation.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.180
attaining the true form of
the Azure Dragon,

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.810
and achieving longevity
equal to heaven and earth.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:31.010
Congratulations, Dragon Lord,
on overcoming your heavenly tribulation!

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.330
Each demon clan has its own leader.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.260
The dragon clan's cultivation
is the most arduous and lengthy,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.060
making true dragons
extremely rare and precious.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.350
The lowest are snakes.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.610
A snake cultivates for 100 years
to become a python,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.330
a python for 500 years
to become a serpent,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.180
a serpent for 500 years
to transform into a scaled dragon,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.940
and a scaled dragon needs 1,000 years
to become a true dragon.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.850
A dragon cultivates for 500 years
to become a horned dragon,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.570
and another 1,000 years
to become a winged dragon.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.260
The winged dragon was originally
the highest rank in the dragon clan.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.780
But since you're exceptionally talented,

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.210
intelligent and diligent,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.810
even if we cultivated together,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.900
I remain stuck at the horned dragon rank,
unable to break through,

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.570
while you have successfully
passed another tribulation.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.180
This is

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.490
unprecedented for an Azure Dragon.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.140
Is there anything above the Azure Dragon?

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.260
You may not remember your past,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.090
but your personality hasn't changed a bit.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.970
Legend has it that above the Azure Dragon
is the Holy Dragon.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.660
If you truly become a Holy Dragon,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.140
you can join the ranks of immortals

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.020
and

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.020
no longer walk in this mortal world.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.900
Would you really be willing to leave?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.090
So you're saying I'm now the top.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.320
Of course.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.480
Under heaven,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.200
there's probably no demon
who can match you now.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.700
Besides you,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.180
there's probably no one

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.580
who could take
the position of Dragon Lord.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.110
Who is the current Demon King?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.560
There are many demon tribes,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.630
ruled separately

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.610
with little connection to each other.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.140
Whoever claims to be king

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.540
will surely face attacks
from other clans.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.580
This is why

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.850
the more powerful the demons become,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.310
the more conflicts arise.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.020
The demons are too strong.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.440
Even if some clans
call someone Demon King,

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.260
deep down

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.950
they don't truly accept it.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.020
The supreme position

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.350
is not easy to maintain.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.780
If you truly wish
to become the Demon King,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.210
it would take considerable effort.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.090
No, no, no.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.090
That's not what I meant.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:33.570
I was

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.540
just asking.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:35.810
Now that you've
successfully passed the tribulation,

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.380
tell me

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.780
what gift you'd like.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.010
Mortal.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.050
Mortal?

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.570
A human.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.300
So you want a slave?

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.170
That's easy.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:48.940
If you want one,

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.670
not just one,

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.850
I can get you hundreds or thousands.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:58.810
Everyone, look!

00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.330
Is this...

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.190
Is this an annular solar eclipse?

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.810
I've only heard about it,

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.160
so it really does exist.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.490
I've only heard about it before.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.110
That makes sense.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.090
This celestial phenomenon

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.420
marks the emergence of
a divine guardian beast.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.970
It signifies that your identity
as the Azure Dragon

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.630
is recognized by the heavens.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780
This eclipse happened because of me?

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.380
Yes.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.810
After successfully
passing the tribulation,

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.570
special celestial phenomena occur.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.300
Before, we've seen
landslides and tsunamis.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.330
This annular solar eclipse

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.860
has never been seen before.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.270
And shooting stars!

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.920
That's the Ao Hen Clan.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.180
With the solar eclipse,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.140
many demons
who rely on sunlight for cultivation

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.940
will have their power weakened.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.330
It seems Ao Hen

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.750
is taking advantage of this opportunity.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.540
What's the relationship
between Ao Hen and the dragon clan?

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.420
Ao Hen usually keeps to themselves,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.380
having no interaction

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.710
with other demon clans.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.820
I'll go check it out.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.369
Sun God!

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.869
We serve you with devotion!

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.020
Please bless us, Sun God!

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.540
The sunlight dims,

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.260
and the Qiong Qi Clan will soon perish!

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.450
A great calamity approaches!

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.610
Please bless us, Sun God!

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:37.690
Please bless us, Sun God!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.650
Please bless us, Sun God!

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.580
Please bless us, Sun God!

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.150
With such a disaster today,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.220
why are you still kowtowing?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.660
Our clan is exceptional,

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.850
envied by many.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.590
Today we must guard against
demons taking advantage of our weakness.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.570
So it's you.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.100
I won't disappoint you
at a time like this.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.180
You like to challenge others, don't you?

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.980
Then accept my challenge today,

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.110
and let fate decide who lives or dies.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:33.950
You treacherous villain!

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.190
Even with the sun obscured,

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.420
I'll still beat you to a pulp!

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.010
The annular solar eclipse is fleeting.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.470
A once-in-a-millennium opportunity

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.400
can't be missed.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.250
So even 10,000 years ago,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.910
Ao Hen was just as detestable.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.900
It's time to teach you a proper lesson.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.210
Taking advantage of others' weakness,

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.540
have you no shame at all?

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.820
The dragon clan actually
has an Azure Dragon now.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.880
Congratulations.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.970
It seems this eclipse is happening
because of you.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.970
I should thank you

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.510
for creating this opportunity for me.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.450
Since it's because of me,

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.660
I must correct

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.390
your bad habit
of plundering in times of trouble.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.530
I've heard that dragons

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.730
never meddle in other clans' disputes.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.380
If today the Qiong Qi Clan is destroyed,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:41.770
I'm just following heaven's will.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.740
Bullshit!

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.480
This is the power of the Azure Dragon?

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.180
The feeling of defeating
an ancient great demon

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.960
is incredibly satisfying.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.520
Blessed by Sun God,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:28.300
today's grudge

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.950
will be avenged today!

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.910
Back and forth,

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.110
your revenge has already been taken.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.530
I stopped you once

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.960
and stopped him once too.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.310
If you don't leave now,

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.330
I can only follow heaven's will.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:56.860
Qiong Qi,

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.730
you won't always be

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.730
as lucky as today.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:04.820
Come back!

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.350
Alright.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.690
He's already failed,
going for wool and coming home shorn.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:09.690
Stop chasing him.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:12.140
What's the point of all this fighting?

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.060
How can I, Qiong Qi, be compared to wool?

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.380
Yes.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.010
You're powerful, not wool.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.170
You're a great demon.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.830
Great demon.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.440
I never expected the Azure Dragon's power

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.700
to be so overwhelming.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.470
From now on, this world

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.710
will likely belong to the dragon clan.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:44.860
Thank you, Azure Dragon, for saving us!

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.590
It was nothing.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.730
Besides, this solar eclipse

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.900
was caused by me.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.100
Everyone, get up.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.510
Every tribulation

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.420
comes with natural disasters.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.750
Fortune or misfortune,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.180
heaven decides each fate.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.710
Xiao Yao,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.580
although you've transformed
into the Azure Dragon,

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.770
you shouldn't take

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.660
all responsibilities upon yourself.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.320
Otherwise,

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.660
wouldn't you be needlessly

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.190
bearing many karmic debts?

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:09.890
Everyone, disperse.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:18.660
Xiao Yao,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.180
I've watched
your daily cultivation progress,

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:22.800
and now

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.690
you've finally
transformed into the Azure Dragon.

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.150
This...

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.290
is truly moving.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.080
Have we known each other for long?

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.290
I watched you grow up!

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.750
You're like a big brother.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.330
I've forgotten many things
after my tribulation.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.980
Could you tell me about them?

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.660
Sure.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.810
What did you just sa? Bull...

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:54.110
Bullshit.

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.040
Bull...

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.870
That's vulgar language!

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.530
You never used to speak like that.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.930
Who did you learn it from?

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.480
Do I need to learn it?

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.520
Before was one thing,

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.620
but now you've become the Azure Dragon,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.750
the greatest Demon King under heaven.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.120
The words may be crude,

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.170
but saying them makes me feel good.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.580
But you still need
to consider your status.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.940
Look at your power.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.860
You now surpass all other demons.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.820
If you can't reason with someone,

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.350
just defeat them directly.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.950
Why use such crude language

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.600
-to degrade...
-Fine.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.410
I won't say it in front of you anymore.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.670
I have matters to attend to. I'm leaving.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.830
Didn't you want to hear about the past?

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:34.290
Let me tell you.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.290
Our Qiong Qi Clan,

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.620
though born with
great strength and courage,

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.150
also has fatal weaknesses.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.470
So I issued challenges everywhere

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.400
to keep others from disturbing us.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.050
But I never expected

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:49.340
that my fighting nature

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.800
would be exploited by you.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.490
Back then

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.460
you were just a Water Dragon,

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.420
-always...
-About... this big?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:57.680
About this big.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.770
Always meddling in injustices.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.860
If there was nothing to meddle with,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.660
you'd create trouble yourself.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.440
Remember that time

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.620
you stole from
the Treasure Swallower's Treasury?

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.250
Then the little Treasure Swallower
discovered you

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.570
and chased after you.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:10.890
You ran straight to me

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:11.680
and told me

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.770
that the little Treasure Swallower

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.690
wanted to lock you up in their Treasury.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.100
Then you told
the little Treasure Swallower

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.500
that I had sent you there.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.290
Ended up with me
and that Treasure Swallower

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:20.590
fighting fiercely,

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.580
while you

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.490
ran off to sunbathe by the sea.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.090
Right here.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:28.110
Right here.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.190
I kicked him all the way
over there with one foot.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.150
Xiao Yao.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.140
Let's fight.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.940
Among us demons,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.460
the strong command respect.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.750
If I win,

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.700
you belong to me.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.440
If I lose,

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.000
I belong to you.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.200
Why?

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.690
That's a win-win for you.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.890
Besides,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:15.250
I'm the Azure Dragon now.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.660
Aren't I the most powerful?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.110
Can you even defeat me?

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.620
Your power may be great,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.770
but your experience is far less than mine.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.590
But I don't want to beat you.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.470
And I definitely
don't want to lose to you.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.430
For thousands of years,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.930
my feelings for you have never changed.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.910
But you always call me Brother.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.220
I couldn't express
my true feelings to you.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.110
No need.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.140
So I made resolutions again and again.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.600
I remember the first time.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.340
I wanted to wait
until you became a horned dragon.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.390
But when I saw you,

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.540
I couldn't say a word.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:50.900
Later I thought,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.580
I'd wait until you became a winged dragon.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:53.980
But...

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.530
But I still held back.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.090
Keep holding back then.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.550
I can't hold back anymore!

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.150
You're now an Azure Dragon.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.970
I'm afraid if I don't tell you now,

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.770
I'll never have another chance!

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.900
I don't even know

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.620
what resolution to make anymore!

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:10.270
Xiao Yao,

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.210
I just want to stay by your side forever.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:13.860
I just...

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.420
Isn't the Azure Dragon
supposed to protect all living beings?

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.760
How could I fight?

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.660
Right?

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.830
Think about when you were little.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.210
I...

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:30.180
When you were little,

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.050
didn't you have many

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:31.900
questions you didn't understand

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.900
and came to ask me?

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:35.350
You can't remember anything now.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.100
Protecting all living beings
is a heavy responsibility.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.820
You need a demon like me by your side

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.620
to advise you.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.250
I...

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.620
Let's just fight.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.180
But I'll set the rules.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.250
If you win,

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.770
I'll fight with you once a month.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:49.660
If you lose,

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.860
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything today,

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.390
and don't bring it up again.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.450
No?

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:56.860
I'm leaving.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.390
Xiao Yao!

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.390
I'll fight.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.780
I never thought
the gap between us was so great.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.380
It's only right that you look down on me.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.080
I didn't mean it that way.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.130
That fight just now

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.310
made me realize

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.510
what my next resolution should be.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.670
Before,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.330
I was arrogant.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.660
The only one worthy of the Azure Dragon

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.030
is the Demon King.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.960
From now on,
I'll challenge you every year.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.100
When I defeat you,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:05.950
I believe

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.290
that the demons

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.580
will acknowledge
my position as Demon King.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.700
Only the Demon King

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.290
is worthy of the Azure Dragon.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:16.620
This guy might be the real tribulation
I have to overcome.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.140
Hong Ye...

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.450
When will you ever become the Demon King?

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.040
Will I even live to see that day?

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.340
Only the Demon King.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.010
Only the Demon King.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.280
We weren't finished talking.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.050
Tell me,

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.220
what connection do I have with humans?

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.020
You are a dragon.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.350
How could you have
any connection with servants?

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.290
Humans have extremely short lives

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.770
and barely any power or cultivation.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:45.900
They are the most

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.580
lowly clan under heaven.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.580
Even capturing them
as servants is a bother

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.980
because they're so dull.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.110
They're hardly worth mentioning.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:55.340
Sister?

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.080
Did you guess it was me?

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.450
Of course.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.110
I'm back!

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.610
What magnificent golden armor.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.690
I knew you'd succeed in your tribulation,

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:13.430
just didn't expect it so soon.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.250
Xiao Yao is now an Azure Dragon.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.000
Stop calling her Sister.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.790
At least call her Dragon Lord.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.290
You're so

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.640
rigid and boring.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.250
No wonder Sister
always wants to avoid you.

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.390
I'm not like that.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.750
I like Sister,

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.860
and I don't care if she's an Azure Dragon

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.720
or Dragon Lord.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:30.050
You...

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:30.910
Right, Sister?

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.400
Sister,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.360
did you get any

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.350
congratulatory gifts
for passing the tribulation?

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.590
No gifts prepared?

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.790
I was worried I'd be late.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:47.490
Unexpectedly,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.980
the timing is perfect.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.670
Freshly out of the tribulation!

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.430
She can't remember anything!

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.190
Probably doesn't recall
your childish tricks.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.100
That's...

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.270
even better.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.730
Even though it's the same trick,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.290
you will still find it fresh.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.120
The same thing

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.970
can make you happy over and over again.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:11.830
How wonderful.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.960
Right, Sister?

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.900
That makes sense.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.090
But, Sister,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.180
do you really remember nothing?

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.970
Not a single thing?

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:26.520
Watch this!

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:37.820
See?

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.480
You remember this, don't you?

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.400
Isn't this...

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:42.340
something we're born knowing?

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:44.890
I can do this up to 20

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:45.720
or more.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.900
20?

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:49.220
Never mind that.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.820
Come with me to see your gift.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.950
I've been preparing it for a long time.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.620
Let's go together.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.770
I still need to cultivate.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:58.770
Right.

00:31:58.770 --> 00:31:59.620
Let's go, Sister.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.900
Don't disturb his cultivation.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.430
Let's go.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.430
Let's go.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:02.950
Xiao...

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.520
Protect...

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.350
Protect all living beings!

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:09.850
That time,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.560
I encountered the Chaos Clan.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:13.340
My power wasn't strong enough then,

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.670
so I could only run away.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.190
When I was beaten,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.970
I would silently count in my head.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:18.970
I thought to myself,

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.140
if I could survive 500 strikes,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.940
that would be quite remarkable.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.620
Just then,

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.600
I heard someone else counting too,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.210
shouting while counting,

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.690
"I dare you to beat me to death!

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.520
Once I take 500 strikes,

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.770
I'll transform into a winged dragon

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.780
and fight you all!"

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.290
I was out of strength,

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.530
but hearing that voice,

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:43.130
I was suddenly full of energy

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.380
and escaped immediately.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.730
That person

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.860
was...

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.580
Me?

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.450
Yes.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.460
Since then,

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.100
you've always been by my side,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.820
eating, drinking, and having fun together.

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.690
No matter how strange my ideas were,

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.490
you could always understand me.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.950
For thousands of years,

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.510
in all heaven and earth,

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.760
you're my only true friend,

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:06.890
the only one I can share

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.010
my heart with.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.150
This

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.340
is the gift.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:23.530
This is Lantern Grass from Mount Kunlun.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.050
It blooms once every thousand years,

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:25.620
and

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.240
only for an instant.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.050
I had to use all my persuasive powers

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.900
to convince it to come down with me.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.410
Sister,

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:33.820
don't blink.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.330
Wake up.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:43.520
The sister I told you about is here.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.110
It's time to bloom.

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:17.790
Xiao Yao.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.739
I've called you sister for 1,000 years,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:22.600
afraid that you

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.480
truly only see yourself as my sister.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.380
Tonight,

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.850
I bare my heart to you.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:30.350
Would you be willing

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:32.250
to become my partner?

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:40.150
Teng She,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.780
I cannot accept.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:44.760
My heart already belongs to someone.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:50.860
This is

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:52.900
the

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.389
999th time you've rejected me.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.780
I thought you forgot everything
after the tribulation.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.570
I'm sorry.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.070
I wasn't being serious.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.100
Why are you taking it so seriously?

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.060
Confirmed.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:14.820
You're

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:16.890
still the same as before.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.270
It's just that before,

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.380
you never mentioned liking anyone.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.110
From now on,

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.530
we can still be friends, right?

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:30.970
If I find more

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.260
rare, delicious, or interesting things,

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.010
can I still

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.340
share it with you?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:38.820
Call me.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.490
Sister.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:47.710
Good.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.780
If you have anything
tasty or fun in the future,

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.180
don't you hide it from me.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.220
Mm.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:56.570
It's just

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.900
a shame about this gift.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.540
I spent so long preparing it.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.050
This Azure Dragon

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.450
is really hard to please.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.500
Never mind.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.420
The person who won your heart

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.030
must be someone
far more impressive than me.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.150
Don't tell me who he is.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.050
I...

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:19.550
don't want to know.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:27.090
You want to go home?

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.050
Sister,

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.420
I need to

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.480
take it back to Mount Kunlun quickly.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:37.380
Goodbye, Sister.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.740
I gave you a chance to run.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.000
Why are you still here?

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.850
Haven't you been beaten enough?

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.480
The Azure Dragon is truly remarkable.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.600
Impressive how well
you've hidden your breath.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.740
You may fool Teng She,

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.940
but you can't fool me.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.780
Let me warn you on behalf of Teng She.

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.340
If you tell anyone about
what happened today,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.340
you'll regret it.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.860
Qiong Qi and Teng She are so lucky

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.300
to have a good friend

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.160
and to have backed the right side.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.900
You're now the Azure Dragon.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.370
Why don't you kill me?

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.970
Why should I kill you?

00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.490
All demon clans

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.090
have been fighting each other
for 1,000 years.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.190
Especially for great demons like us,

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.220
cultivation is extremely difficult.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.590
Even without grudges,

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.900
demons still fight to steal others' power

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.240
for their own gain.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.530
My power didn't come from stealing.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.040
But now you have this ability.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.130
Why not take this shortcut?

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:49.790
What kind of shortcut is that?

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:51.160
You steal from him,

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.860
then another great demon steals from you.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.040
If no one focuses on cultivation

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.490
and everyone just
keeps stealing from each other,

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:56.490
what happens when

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.860
there's nothing left to steal?

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.060
What will you do then?

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:02.900
Without inner peace,

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:04.450
nothing can be achieved.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.180
I know a powerful great demon.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.900
He protects the demons in Demons' Valley,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.380
which is a heavy responsibility,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.170
yet he still practices cultivation
diligently every day.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.090
For him,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:14.420
cultivation

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.780
is also about cultivating the mind.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.600
Where is Demons' Valley?

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:23.970
Demons' Valley

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.650
is a land of peace

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:28.480
where the demons

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.900
live together in peace.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.220
Relying solely on self-cultivation,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.550
when will one
become the best in the world?

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.450
I am the Azure Dragon.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.960
I am the best in the world.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.530
With me around,
you'll never be number one.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.860
What can you do about it?

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.820
Cultivation is about balance and change.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.790
No one should boast about forever.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.340
I just love seeing you unable

00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:57.000
to out-argue or out-fight me.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.860
It's getting late.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.700
Get some rest.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.620
Cultivation is a lifelong journey.

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.080
You probably won't
figure it out right away.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:30.780
Just

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:32.930
don't stray onto the wrong path.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.490
Xiao Yao,

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.870
are you still there?

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.220
Hide your breath first.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.550
Come out after we leave.

00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:40.970
Mm.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.010
I'm here!

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.420
Xiao Yao.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.940
Teng She has had enough fun,

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:49.140
and I let him go ahead.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:49.820
Hurry.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.860
-I have something to ask you.
-Back then, I...

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:51.740
Come on. Let's go.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:52.700
-I just...
-Go.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.120
Go, keep going.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.260
Come on.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:55.820
Don't trip me up.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.020
Hurry, move forward.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:16.450
Since the Azure Dragon's emergence,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:17.530
the weather has become favorable,

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.090
and the land has been peaceful.

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.340
There have been fewer conflicts
among the demons as well.

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:24.090
Everyone seems to settle down
and focus on their cultivation.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.620
We should really thank you.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.300
If the world could remain like this,

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.260
I would be content.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:31.740
You will live as long as heaven and earth,

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.940
so things will naturally stay this way.

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.220
Dragon Lord!

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.860
Dragon Lord.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.530
Greetings, Dragon Lord.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.970
Little dragon, why are you so reckless?

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:46.630
My name is Long Yu.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.260
[Long Yu]

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.170
Don't call me little dragon.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.900
You're clearly just a scaled dragon,

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.420
not yet transformed into a true dragon.

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.860
How can you use the surname "Long"?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.560
I'm only half a level away.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:56.340
With the Dragon Lord as my guiding light,

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.800
it's just a matter of time.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.450
With that ambition of yours,

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.510
I don't mind you using the name early.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:03.540
Tell me quickly,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.700
what's the matter?

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.100
The Dragon Lord's birthday is coming soon.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.420
My birthday?

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.010
Yes.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.900
This is

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.220
your first birthday
since becoming the Azure Dragon.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.340
We must celebrate it grandly.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:15.470
A grand celebration isn't necessary.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.960
If there must be something special,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.070
I'd like to have a bowl of noodle soup.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:23.530
What is noodle soup?

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.030
So in this era,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.130
noodles haven't been invented yet.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.330
My wish is

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:51.490
to see Hong Ye again.
