WEBVTT

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.359
Slow down.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.159
What's wrong, Secretary Lin?

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.120
You...

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.079
Are you jealous?

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:21.760
I'm not.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.079
I was just talking to that Mr. Mofei

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.159
a little more than usual.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.200
Isn't that perfectly normal?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
Stop it. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920
I don't like it.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.719
I don't care what you like.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:36.280
Then why did you say those things?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.159
Things about marrying me and being in love.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.480
Then you unilaterally tell me to forget it.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.879
You do whatever you want.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.480
You never consider my feelings.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.519
You stir someone up,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.120
then tell me to forget it.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.879
That's why I don't like you.

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:04.000
You've already said you don't like me.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.959
So why care who I talk to

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.039
or who I'm warm with?

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.439
Secretary Xue.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.000
Has the Design Department

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.520
submitted next quarter's proposal?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.879
What?

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.759
It was sent to your email last night.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.319
Follow up with the Marketing Department

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.639
on the press release copy for next month.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.759
The Marketing Department...

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.319
has already been reminded.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.800
They can schedule it by Wednesday at the latest.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.000
Where's the latest resource directory?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.000
Here.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.280
It seems Secretary Xue won't be able

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.240
to adapt to the secretary role anytime soon.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.360
We need to post a new job opening.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.439
Are you looking for a new secretary?

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.840
Will I be fired?

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.719
As long as you're willing,

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.360
I can give you enough time to adapt.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.039
But right now,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.360
I do need a new primary assistant.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.560
Secretary Lin,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.000
I'll leave this matter to you.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.719
I hope we can find the right person directly this time.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.000
Yes, Boss.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.919
I'll arrange it.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.159
Oh, right.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.520
I think I still need a male secretary.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.800
Didn't you say a female secretary was more convenient?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.919
I changed my mind.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.280
Do you have any objections?

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.800
Boss, you really are capricious

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.599
and hard to predict.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.879
Yes.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.439
Capricious

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.360
and unpredictable.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.439
That's just my nature.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.719
You've been with me for three years.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.159
Aren't you clear on that by now?

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.240
Secretary Lin,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.519
the coffee is good.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.319
I'm glad you like it.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.199
Get back to work.

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.319
Ms. Qin.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.279
We meet again.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.519
Mofei, what brings you here?

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.319
Please, have a seat.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.399
I'm here today to sign a collaboration

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.399
agreement with the Qin Group.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.160
And also,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.680
to come and say hello to you.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.560
What's wrong with Secretary Lin?

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.439
Just as I thought.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.560
There's something between these two.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.160
About last time,

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160
my apologies.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:38.759
It's nothing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I feel that

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.120
when approaching a woman as charming as Ms. Qin,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.160
even before making contact,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.759
I was already prepared

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.120
to be envied and resented.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.360
Is that so?

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:49.439
Of course.

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:52.279
I always feel

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.000
we have an unfinished story.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.920
An unfinished

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.920
story.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.920
Ms. Qin,

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.079
we will meet again.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.040
You've already said you don't like me.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.959
So why care who I talk to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.120
or who I'm warm with?

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.560
Secretary Lin,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.480
is this the person you found?

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.199
They were all selected according to your requirements.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.360
Is President Qin not satisfied?

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.959
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.800
We will consider it carefully.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.160
Xiao Xue.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.120
Go and have the next group

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.000
No need.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.040
Leave the rest to the Human Resources Department.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.920
I need a break.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:12.519
President Qin,

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.079
the interviewees made an effort to come here.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.319
Secretary Lin,

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:19.639
You couldn't possibly be

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.839
trying to prevent me from finding a new secretary?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.680
President Qin,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.680
are you...

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.600
unwilling for me to leave?

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.480
It seems Secretary Lin has truly learned

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.319
the essence in these three years with me.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.439
Extremely self-righteous.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.639
I simply don't want

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.680
to be left with no one to do my work

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.519
after you're gone.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.839
President Qin, you're overthinking it.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.319
I just think that compared to looks,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.000
ability is more important.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.800
President Qin,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.120
there's only one candidate left.

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:49.959
Shall we interview him separately?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.480
Hello, everyone.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:04.720
Mr. Li Yi.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.480
How come you look

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.399
different from

00:08:06.399 --> 00:08:07.439
the photo?

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:08.720
Sorry about that.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:12.040
I had some surgery half a year ago.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.160
The photo on my resume

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.000
hasn't been updated yet.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:21.720
That concludes my self-introduction.

00:08:23.079 --> 00:08:24.240
The next question.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.639
Secretary Lin, please ask the question.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.680
Please explain.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:34.240
The basic principles of the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.279
Then you explain.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.559
The Black-Scholes option pricing model's.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.320
Basic principles.

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.000
The Black-Scholes option pricing model.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.399
Determines the price of European options.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.399
Assuming an efficient market.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.519
The underlying asset price.

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:50.879
Follows a geometric Brownian motion.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.919
The core formula is as follows.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.720
Um.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:55.879
What are the full names of all past Nobel Prize in Literature winners?

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.080
Recite the list of all Nobel Prize in Literature laureates.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.480
1901, Sully Prudhomme.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.480
1902, Theodor Mommsen.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.399
1903, Bj...

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.200
Very good, very good.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.440
The most important thing for a secretary.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.879
Is not just ability.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:16.600
But also a sense of time.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:18.919
From the moment you entered the room until now.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.360
How many seconds have passed in total?

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.120
How many seconds have passed since you entered the room?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.720
I have a habit of carrying a stopwatch.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.840
It is now.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.399
567 seconds.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.360
Very good, excellent.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.759
Your materials.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.360
We will consider them carefully.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.279
Secretary Xue.

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:44.960
Please see this gentleman out.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:45.840
Thank you for your trouble.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.679
Thank you.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.559
After you.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.240
Why?

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.200
What?

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:06.399
I originally thought.

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:08.440
We could be more sincere and straightforward with each other.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:10.159
Because that's how I've been acting.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.440
But recently.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.279
I've been a bit disappointed in you.

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:19.000
Did I do something wrong?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.080
You're clearly jealous.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.320
Yet you stubbornly deny it.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.879
You clearly don't want to find me a new secretary.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.919
So you use this kind of.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:30.039
This ridiculous method.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:34.240
Is it so impossible for you to trust me?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.720
To trust me the way I trust you?

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:41.799
Yes.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.600
I do need you very much.

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.759
But not the kind of need one has for a secretary.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.200
But rather like...

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.879
President Qin.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.120
I'm here to get the resumes of those candidates from earlier.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.200
Secretary Xue.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.000
What is it?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.039
The resumes, right?

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.480
I'll send you the resumes later.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.399
You and HR can review them.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.600
I think the last one was quite good.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.960
