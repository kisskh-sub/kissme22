[Xinfang Pavilion]

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.870
Tailor Chen has been waiting outside

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.070
since early morning.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.479
After Mr. Lu finished breakfast,

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.680
he called Mr. Chen in
to take measurements.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.950
He hasn't gone out.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.039
Did you hear that?

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:46.400
That Yang fellow

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.920
clearly harbors ill intent.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.400
He's shifting the blame,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.950
turning you against Mr. Lu

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.680
and scheming to ruin your marriage.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.870
Such a man should be arrested

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.789
and subjected to harsh interrogation.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.070
We were going to pay a sick visit.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530
There was nothing to hide.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.530
If he followed us, let him.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.000
With all your talk of violence,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.230
are you trying to turn our Rong family
into a nest of thugs?

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.280
Besides, Mr. Yang

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280
is an honored guest of Grandmother.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.039
I'll inform her about this.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.370
How he is dealt with

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.960
will be for her to decide.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.630
You're about to get married.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.870
Why keep them around?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.590
Take this chance to drive them away.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.390
If they stay longer,
there will surely be trouble.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.360
If Grandmother insists on keeping them,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.079
could it be that she still hasn't given up

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.680
on matching you with someone else?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.800
I'm not the only daughter
in our Rong family.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.590
None of my sisters are married yet.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.590
Grandmother must have her reasons.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.590
Only Old Madam Rong

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.079
would believe his sweet talk.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.840
He's a scheming, silver-tongued scoundrel.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.040
Whoever marries him is bound to suffer.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.800
Miss Rong, Old Madam Rong
wants to see you.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.680
Has this matter reached
Chongxi Hall so quickly?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.079
I'll go see Grandmother.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
As for Mr. Yang,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.910
he'll have to stay
in the guest room for now.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.240
Without my permission,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.690
he's not allowed to wander around.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.530

when it comes to matters of the heart,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.940
you still fall short of Yunxi.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.750
She knew there was a vast gap
between their stations,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.190
and their families were worlds apart.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.990
Even with love,
they could never be a proper match.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.190
So she chose to devote herself
to the family business,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.320
never speaking of personal feelings,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.490
and sparing no effort
to amass great wealth.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.310
How could Li's future

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.750
ever be lacking?

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.079
What a pity.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.620
She lacked patience and endurance,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.310
rushed to outshine you,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.310
and mistook a mere bandit

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.870
for a bringer of fortune.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.520
How ridiculous.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.430
Nothing escapes you, Grandmother.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.800
You've known about
Li's true identity all along.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.930
If you hadn't brought
that child back,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.180
I would have acknowledged
her heritage myself.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.480
The descendant of our Rong family

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.240
cannot be raised by outsiders.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.750
Bring her back here

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.270
and raise her properly for a few years,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.000
so she won't end up like Yunshu,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.630
brought up by her mother

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.480
to be submissive,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.120
timid, and meek,

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.620
lacking the bearing
of a true Rong daughter.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.800
Yunshu is naturally gentle and shy.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.570
Though she may not be
as perceptive as Yunxi,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.190
she makes up for it
with kindness, humility,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.320
and wide knowledge,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.890
far surpassing the mischievous Yunyin.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.870
She is also dutiful to you, Grandmother,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870
always the first to pay her respects.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.930

Grandmother.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.890
I have made my decision.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.470
And I hope for your blessing, Grandmother.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.600
42 years ago,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.390
I too was married here

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.870
beneath the paired pillar.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.600
He was just like your Mr. Lu,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.560
handsome and talented,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.820
exceptionally intelligent,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.800
with rare wisdom.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.390
All who saw him

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680
could not help but feel admiration.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.870
That year,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.600
I was escorting

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.200
a tea shipment for my mother.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.560
Our boat was docked
with curtains half-drawn.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.920
He was reading by candlelight.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.750
The reeds are lush and green.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.350
I fell for him at first sight.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.310
He was the only son

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.100
of an official family.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.960
His parents threatened to kill themselves

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.800
if he married into the Rong family.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.440
Yet he chose to elope with me.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.430
How devoted and loyal he was.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.450
So, despite my parents' objections,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.430
I secretly brought him here

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.650
and we vowed to be married.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.670
Grandmother, do you mean

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.320
my biological grandfather?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.430
Look.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.600
Does he

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.040
deserve to be your grandfather?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.159
I grew up in the tea plantation.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.070
Beyond knowing tea,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.430
I understood little of the ways
of the world or the hearts of men.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.890
It was my first time
traveling far from home.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.600
I never suspected

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.870
why that boat would dock

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.120
right next to mine,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.010
and why the cabin doors faced each other,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.190
allowing me to instantly fall for

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.430
that young master reading by candlelight.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.750
I never imagined

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.070
that people

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.750
could be so calculating
against the innocent.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.010
His entire family staged a performance,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.630
all to deceive me

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.920
and seize the secret of tea cultivation

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.260
to rescue their failing family fortune.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.120
While I was fighting
for my life in childbirth,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.120
he stole the precious tea seedlings

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.240
and my hand-written

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.270
tea manual,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
then returned to his hometown

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.530
with his beautiful cousin.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.510
His little scheme

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.310
couldn't fool my mother.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.330
She lured him into a trap

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.800
and brought him before me,

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.240
to be dealt with as I pleased.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.270
I could have killed him,

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.190
but I decided to let him go

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.920
to bear the consequences

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.240
of his own actions.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.560
Later, he fell into disgrace,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.270
ruined and destitute.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.540
Hunted down by creditors and disfigured,

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.730
he came back to beg me for his life.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.540
I kept him in the ancestral hall

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.830
as a warning to future generations.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.160
As long as you're a daughter
of our Rong family,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.270
fortune hunters

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.390
will be as numerous as fish in the river.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.549
Handsome and talented men

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.200
will be yours for the taking.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.880
But once you indulge in romance

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.990
and forget your duty,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.800
this is the fate that awaits you.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.050
I have taken your words

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.910
to heart, Grandmother.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.390
Good.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.670
Then swear it

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.500
before our ancestors.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.370
May the Rong family
ancestors bear witness,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.790
I, Rong Shanbao, swear today,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.480
that in my lifetime, I shall devote myself

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.320
to the revitalization
of the tea of our Rong family.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.030
In all matters, the prosperity of
our family shall come first.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.390
May my humble efforts

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.550
contribute to something greater,

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.040
like the faint light of a firefly

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.720
adding brightness to the sun and moon.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.450
Through countless hardships,

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.400
my resolve shall never change.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.010
What if the man you marry

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.430
betrays the Rong family?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.480
Tell me.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.600
Tell me!

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.080
If Mr. Lu betrays the Rong family

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.120
in the future,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.200
he shall be my enemy.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.560
I will cut all ties with him,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.580
and show no mercy.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.600
Swear it upon yourself.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.060
If I break even half

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.130
a word of this oath,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.910
may my husband leave and children scatter,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:38.960
my life cut short,

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.190
and may I die without a resting place.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.000
Good.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.610
Remember what you've said.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.930
If you break your word someday,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.050
the vow you made will come true.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.090
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.840
[Minister Xu]

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.840
Once we reach the ferry,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.790
we'll sail south

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.070
day and night,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.130
and we should be in Linji
before the end of the month.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.220
[Xu Meiying]

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.010
[Rong Mansion]

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.470
Take this silk over there.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.620
Align it with this one.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:21.670
Be careful.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:30.930
Bring it over here.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.670
Move the flowerpot over there.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.390
Yes.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.960
Come on, hurry.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.640
Be careful. This way.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.150
Be careful.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.440
Watch out.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.150
Come on, quickly.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.790
Let's go.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.470
Come here.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.960
You know what to do?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.120
I understand.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.480
You promised not to lose your temper,

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480
and you'd better keep that promise.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.050
You think I'd throw a fit
over a mere title?

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.120
You've clearly underestimated me.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.950
On the surface, everything seems bright,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.080
yet like fire on oil,

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.630
it could turn

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.850
for better or worse.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.010
What do you mean?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.290
Lady Rong had three husbands.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.030
Some died, some left.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.600
Finding another is just how things are.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.030
Fortune rises and falls.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.120
No one stays at the top forever.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.330
There's plenty of time ahead.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.720
He won't be winning forever.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.200
Lady Rong

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.280
won't allow it either.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.110
You had a grand-uncle

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.870
who once entered the Rong household

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.440
and won the favor of Lady Rong.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.170
But he was frail and died young,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.520
leaving no children.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.150
If he had lived longer,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.320
perhaps

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.790
you might have had

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.920
some close cousins.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.460
Did none of your elders

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480
ever tell you of these things?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.270
You seem

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.350
completely unaware of all this.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.480
I've been studying tea
in the mountains since childhood.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.540
I've never heard of

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.300
these old stories.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.970
Who's there?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.240
Stop!

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360
Stop right there!

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.130
Well? Do you catch him?

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.550
Young Master.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.180
The paper is blank.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.440
What's there to hide?

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.870
There are many ways to send messages.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.130
If it truly were blank,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
why go to all the trouble

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
of delivering it?

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.590
There must be something hidden within.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.750
Mr. Yan, you always say

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.610
that Lu Fusheng is kind-hearted.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.530
How about we make a bet?

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480
The master is not at home.
It's not appropriate to open the door.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.440
Who's there?

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:59.870
We're from the Government Office.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.070
Clerk Qing sent me to deliver a message.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.090
That heartless man.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.910
He hasn't been seen for over ten days,

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:09.440
and I thought

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.910
he'd been scared off by me,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.440
leaving me all alone.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.890
My apologies for the wait. Please come in.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.370
Please come in.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.910
He was called to go with Magistrate Wang

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.170
to inspect the fields.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.240
He didn't have time to inform you.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.440
Before leaving, he specifically asked us

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.480
to bring some firewood, wine, and meat,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.280
along with pastries and fruits,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960
so you wouldn't be waiting in vain.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
We were delayed by official matters

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.090
these past few days.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.390
So we're late. Please don't blame us.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.790
No worries at all.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.240
I'm not short of

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.750
food or firewood here.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.600
Thank you for checking in on me.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.320
I'll call the maid to make some tea.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.720
Have a cup of tea before you leave.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.240
Ms. Xu! Ms. Xu!

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:52.910
Mrs. Qing.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.960
Do you recognize this token?

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.510
Clerk Qing said

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.720
the Master has grown suspicious.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.040
The item on your house beam

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:03.950
could cause trouble.

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.609
I'm to find it and take it away,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.819
before it brings disaster on you.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:09.920
Wait here.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.400
Here.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.750
That will do.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.920
Magistrate Lang,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.070
I've treated you well,

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.440
and this is how you repay me?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.760
Seize him.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:03.440
Miss Rong.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.440
All young ladies
have brought gifts to you,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.300
and they're all waiting outside.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.010
Let them in.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.070
Yes.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.800
Congratulations, Shanbao.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.420
This pair of bracelets

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.110
was personally chosen by Li.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.070
May you and Mr. Lu

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.460
be blessed by the spirits and ancestors,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.160
and live in harmony and happiness

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.200
for all eternity.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.350
Thank Li for me.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.350
Hualin Courtyard is filled with riches,

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:45.150
yet you've never cared for them.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.010
Today is your wedding day,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.050
I can offer nothing grand,

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.520
only this set of glass tea cups,

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.770
as my gift of congratulation.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.290
No wonder the poem says,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.790
"Colored like cold ice;

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.440
Nothing obscures its clarity."

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.720
They're so crystal clear

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.350
that you can see your reflection in them.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.160
They're even better than the ones

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.020
Grandmother received last year.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.640
Today is a good day,

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.720
so Grandmother showed you mercy
and gave you the day off.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.120
Don't cause any trouble.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.280
This is the first autumn tea
from the plantation.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.140
I picked and processed it myself,

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.080
as a congratulatory gift for you, Shanbao.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.520
It's good to see you
show such sincere remorse

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.480
and specially pick
autumn tea as an offering.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.880
Grandmother would be pleased to know this.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.060
Xiu Qiong.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.400
Take this to Chongxi Hall

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
and invite Grandmother to taste it.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:04.720
No.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.260
This tea... this tea can't be drunk.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.710
I accidentally scorched it.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.000
I'll go back and make a fresh batch.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.030
It can't be drunk?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.030
What a pity.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.830
I had thought of how you've been

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.130
working diligently in the tea plantation,

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.550
and intended to persuade Grandmother

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.020
to let you return home sooner.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.190
Since your tea-making skills

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.520
aren't quite there yet,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.920
you'd better stay there

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.510
and practice for another two years.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.830
What? Two years?

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.820
Are you trying to kill me?

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.210
Yunyin, you've been so careless.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.370
How did this happen?

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.590
Your heart is black to the core.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.790
Who'd ever marry you?

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.750
That precious Lu of yours

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.160
is only lusting after your looks
and coveting power.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.290
But he'll regret it bitterly someday!

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.600
And all you bootlickers,

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.440
prattling on about "a perfect match"

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.680
and "a match made in heaven."

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.480
In my eyes,

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.880
they're completely mismatched.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.480
The fighting and betrayal

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.340
are yet to come!

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:26.920
Yunshu.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:28.960
What have you brought?

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.640
Let me see.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.350
I strung these fortune beads myself.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.350
They'll bring you good luck, Shanbao.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.720
May bad omens never come true,

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.030
and only the good ones do.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.830
Those who spread rumors and cause trouble

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.200

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200
their own karma.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.590
Thank you for
your skillful handiwork, Yunshu.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.520
Your gift couldn't be more timely.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.640
It's only early autumn.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.580
These socks are far too thick.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:15.850
I'll roast in them.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.240
There's no need to go to all this trouble.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.110
Change them.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.310
That won't do.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.350
Young Master, after

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.400
paying respects to ancestors
in the ancestral hall today,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.030
you'll officially be the Rong family's
eldest son-in-law.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.590
Our wedding customs
differ from those of others.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.590
There are no red ribbons
or cross-cup wine.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.830
The young ladies will gather
in the bridal chamber

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.830
to celebrate the auspicious day.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:32.680
If they catch the groom,

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.030
they'll certainly make mischief.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:35.790
Young Master, you must sneak
into the room in the dark,

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:36.920
without being seen.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.530
Walking barefoot would be the safest way.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:41.920
What happens if they

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.880
catch me?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.720
If they take you away,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.430
even Miss Rong won't
be able to get you back.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.130
Where is Jun Dai?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.510
I sent him to check the tea room.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.040
Why hasn't he returned yet?

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.790
These are the gifts presented by

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.440
the various households in the city,
as well as by the Rong family's

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.700
tea shops and estates.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:23.510
Miss Rong informed us beforehand,

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:25.000
and we know you prefer simplicity

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.240
and dislike extravagance.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.000
So the gifts are mostly scholarly items,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.590
antiques, calligraphy and paintings.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.480
Miss Rong ordered them all brought here

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.080
for your inspection, Mr. Lu.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.110
I misspoke.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.940
I should address you as Young Master.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.510
After you've seen them, Young Master,

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.160
please select the ones
you like to display,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.620
and the rest will
be stored in the storeroom.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.260
Just these will do.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:41.960
Yes.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.760
Young Master!

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.480
Well, Jun Dai.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.030
Today I need to serve tea to Lady Rong.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.270
I sent you to check the tea room,

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.070
yet you return at this late hour?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.590
If it weren't such an auspicious day,

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.320
you'd certainly get a beating.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.920
Please calm down, Young Master.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.680
I've carefully checked everything.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.810
And the tea is ready.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.310
Young Master.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:22.750
Last night, Lord Lang

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.290
left the government office
with two of his confidants

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.820
and hasn't returned since.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.240
Oh no.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.480
He must have not

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.350
taken my advice

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.390
and has gone to fetch that ledger himself,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.320
only to fall right into their trap.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.240
Mr. Lu,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.830
where are you heading?

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.400
Someone has sent

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.730
a secret letter for you.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.230
Heating it over the flame

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.350
reveals its contents.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.910
You came to this mansion

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:19.230
for this person's whereabouts, right?

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.550
I don't know anything
about any secret letter.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.550
Don't worry. I'm not deceiving you.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.400
I went to see it myself

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.540
and it really gave me quite a shock.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:30.680
If I call out loudly,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.160
you'll be in serious trouble.

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.510
I advise you

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.160
not to act rashly.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.120
What exactly do you want?

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.880
Earlier,

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.870
I heard something outside about

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.960
someone having gone missing.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.920
Now you're in a bind.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.400
Between saving a life and
the wedding at the ancestral hall,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.110
you can only choose one.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.920
How dare you

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.320
break into my office!

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.820
As Imperial Inspector, I have toured

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.960
the counties on behalf of the Emperor.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.640
Everywhere I go, all local officials
show me respect.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.900
When my sedan arrives,

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.590
even provincial governors must kneel

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.880
in the rain to welcome me.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.840
Until I speak,

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.230
they remain kneeling in mud,

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.490
not daring to stand up.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:57.250
If I wish to enter your office,

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.590
why would I need to force my way in?

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.590
Inspector Lu died in the river,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.360
and his death notice
was sent to the capital.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.150
Who are you?

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.030
Do you know that
impersonating an imperial envoy

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.840
is a capital offense?

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.320
I anticipated your failing eyesight,

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.430
fearing you might not recognize me.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.320
So I had hidden my official robe and seal

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.380
in the wall behind the kitchen stove,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.030
and just retrieved them.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.180
My Lord, spare the chatter,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.160
or it'll be a wasted effort.

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.530
Jun Dai.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.370
I ran into Clerk Qing on the street

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.330
a few days ago and invited him home.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.150
We had a pleasant conversation.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.810
I'd wanted to keep him longer,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.550
but knowing how much you value him

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.400
and cannot bear to
be without him even for a day,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.460
I've personally returned him to you.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.630
My Lord! Save me!

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.950
Help me! My Lord!

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.460
I've brought your
valued talent back to you.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.770
How do you intend to repay me for it?

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:08.710
Guards!

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.480
Lu Jianglai,

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.450
you're too arrogant for your own good.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.770
How dare you, Xu Song!

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.710
In broad daylight, you surround

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.230
an Imperial Inspector with soldiers.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.830
Are you staging a rebellion?

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.920
Lord Lu, you wouldn't act this brazenly

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.190
without someone to back you up.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.000
Bring them in.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.280
Lord Lang!

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.590
My Lord!

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.580
Save me, My Lord!

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:14.590
My Lord!

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.010
Lu Jianglai, you...

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.880
My Lord!

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.620
You hurt my man first.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.910
I'm merely returning the favor.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.360
Our accounts

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.710
will be settled another day.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.400
Farewell.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.230
My Lord.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.510
Are you letting them go just like that?

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.070
Get lost!

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:03.560
Useless!

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.110
Prepare my sedan chair.
I'm going to the Governor's office.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:08.590
Yes.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.510
See if he's gone!

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.940
My hand hurts.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.780
[Rong Mansion]

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:35.480
Miss Rong.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.280
To get Madam Yang out of the residence,

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.190
you even faked Lady Yunwan's death.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.850
That was sheer recklessness.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.110
Old Madam Rong is still furious

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.990
and probably refuses to see you.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.510
Ms. Yan, please convey
my words to Grandmother.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:56.480
If she wishes me to kneel
and reflect on my faults,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.360
I would not normally dare disobey.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.890
However, a storm is brewing

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.920
and the Rong family will face turmoil.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.320
I have important matters to attend to,

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.670
and must hurry back to handle them.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.440
After the court matter is settled,

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.570
I'll come back to beg her forgiveness.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.670
So this is the bet
you wanted to make with me?

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.930
I've told you already.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.860
Lu Fusheng is a court spy.

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.840
He infiltrated the Rong family
with ulterior motives,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.500
yet you refused to believe me.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.200
You thought I slandered him

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.110
out of jealousy.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.280
Now

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.360
you've seen everything with your own eyes.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.080
For a single secret letter,

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.510
he abandoned Shanbao
without a second thought.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.190
It shows that he never had
an ounce of genuine feeling.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.320
It was all pretense.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.730
And you treated him

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.590
as a trusted friend,

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.610
helping him at every turn.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.330
I'm afraid, in his eyes,

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.310
you are nothing more than a fool.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.190
If you truly had your doubts,

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.070
you should have spoken
to Miss Rong privately,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.870
so she could have been prepared.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.150
Instead, you let her be abandoned

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.480
in full view of everyone.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.070
How is she

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.230
supposed to face the Rong family?

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.160
And how could she

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.110
not be heartbroken?

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:25.510
She trampled on my heart,

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.730
and you still want me
to care about her feelings?

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.830
Let her feel the pain.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.610
Only when she's deeply hurt
will she understand,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.360
cut ties with that deceiver

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.000
and turn against him.

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:52.920
I'm from the Yang family!

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.760
Let me out!

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.030
Open the door!

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.160
I order you to open the door immediately!

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.420
I need to see Miss Rong!

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.600
Open the door.

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.760
Miss Rong.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.630
I came here as a guest.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.920
Is this how your Rong family

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:14.780
treats guests?

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.880
What law have I broken

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.110
that you must imprison me?

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.710
You are utterly heartless.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.570
We all know perfectly well

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.840
why you came here.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:23.490
Spare me the pretense.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.850
Go back and tell your father

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.600
that Madam Yang has been
taken by the officials.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.000
Miss Rong.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.190
You should give

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.990
our Yang family an explanation.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.950
Explanation?

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.630
I never

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.480
pushed my own sister into a living hell,

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.000
and ruined her entire life

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.710
just to curry favor with the Wei family.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.480
I never stood by

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.840
and watched my closest kin suffer torment

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.440
for the sake of the immense profits

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.540
the Wei family promised.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.290
And I certainly never

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.190
tried to take possession
of the Wei family's tea plantation

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.920
by accusing my brother-in-law
of killing his wife.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.960
It was clearly your Rong family

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.360
who harbored a criminal first.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.760
When our Yang family
found no trace of her,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.760
only then did we accuse
Wei Kejian of murdering her.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.150
Now that the truth has come to light

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:13.800
and my family faces utter ruin.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:14.510
How can your Rong family

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:15.840
stay out of this matter?

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.360
Father.

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.530
Our Rong family sheltered

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.150
a pitiful woman who had
been beaten by her husband

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.440
and mother-in-law,
causing her to miscarry.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.280
She was bedridden

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.030
for three months and barely survived.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:27.230
She committed no murder

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.000
and no crime of any kind.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.630
How can you call her a criminal?

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.140
Even if this were
brought before the court,

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.230
she would appear as a witness,
not an accused.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.550
And you want to shift the blame

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:36.480
for false accusation onto others?

00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.110
Where

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.440
is there such a bargain?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.360
You...

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:39.840
Father.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.390
[Lu Yu, the Sage of Tea]

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:17.990
I never imagined that people

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.620
could be so calculating
against the innocent.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:22.880
His entire family staged a performance,

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.600
all to deceive me

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.940
and seize the secret of tea cultivation

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:32.200
to rescue their failing family fortune.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:35.110
While I was fighting
for my life in childbirth,

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:37.110
he stole the precious tea seedlings

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.290
and my hand-written tea manuel.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.060
Lu Yu was a tea scholar
of the Tang dynasty

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.260
and the author of The Classic of Tea.

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.210
Tea farmers and merchants
of the Tang Dynasty

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.320
regarded him as
the patron saint of tea industry.

00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.110
Some tea merchants

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.190
display his statue

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.110
in their shops.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.450
When business was good,

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:56.000
they would offer flowers and fruits.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.060
When business was poor,

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.390
they would pour hot water over his statue.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.880
His figurines were even

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.230
sold together with

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.590
tea sets,

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.480
much like tea pets.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:08.820
If you ask why did tea merchants

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.150
of Tang-dynasty behave this way?

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.230
It was because

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:12.650
The Classic of Tea

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.590
had propelled
the tea industry into prominence.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:16.320
As the poet Mei Yaochen once wrote,

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.780
"Since Lu Yu came into the world,

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:20.220
people have learned
to appreciate spring tea."

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.130
In a sense,

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:22.860
it was Lu Yu who transformed tea

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.370
from a local product into a luxury item,

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.400
enabling tea farmers and merchants
alike to amass wealth.
