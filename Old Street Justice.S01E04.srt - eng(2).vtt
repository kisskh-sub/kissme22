00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.159
When will my son wake up?

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.479
Your son needs multiple dialysis sessions

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:44.799
to slowly detoxify.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.960
As for when he'll wake up,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.200
it depends on his condition.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.119
What?

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:50.280
Then do the dialysis.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.600
Do it.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.119
Go ahead.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.560
Family, let me finish first.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.280
This dialysis uses imported technology.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.439
It costs at least twenty thousand each time.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:56.560
You better think it through.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.159
We'll do it.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.240
We'll sell everything to pay for it.

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:01.759
Please arrange it quickly.

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:02.039
Do it.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.679
Do it.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.560
Thank you for your trouble.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.840
You're welcome.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.280
Xiaoxiao.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.640
Manager Bai.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.319
Thank you.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.680
It's nothing.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.359
Xiaoxiao.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.079
Uncle is here to see you.

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:07.879
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.480
Get out.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.439
Stay away from my child.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200
Dafo, what do you mean by this?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.480
I worked so hard to get Xiaoxiao

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.519
back from those jerks in Daixiang Village.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:14.879
Yaqing.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.079
I don't expect thanks,

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:18.719
but why won't you even let me see the child?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:19.840
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.920
Don't take credit you don't deserve.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.519
Xiaoxiao was saved by Manager Bai.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:24.719
What does it have to do with you?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.079
Who?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.760
Who?

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.879
The doctor already told us.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:30.680
If Manager Bai hadn't brought him in time,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.519
we would have...

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.560
we wouldn't have seen Xiaoxiao again.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:35.519
Auntie Feng.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.359
I saw with my own eyes

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:37.879
Shengzi rescue Xiaoxiao.

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.599
What does Bai Yuchen have to do with it?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.879
Say something!

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.640
I was the one driving the child here.

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.799
That's just what they assumed.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.560
You tell me, I...

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.599
Erni.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.599
You don't need to make Manager Bai lie.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
Anyone can see what's really going on.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.599
Besides,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280
the doctor wouldn't lie.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.799
That's not true, Auntie Feng.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.879
Xiaoxiao really was saved by Shengzi.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:59.359
It's just that I...

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.159
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.560
Did you poison Xiaoxiao?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.599
I...

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:04.319
Dafo.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.519
Look at the wounds on Shengzi's body.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.960
If he wasn't trying to save Xiaoxiao,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.120
how could he be like this?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.759
He...

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.719
He was trying to harm our Xiaoxiao.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.759
He was beaten by people Manager Bai found.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.360
Don't play your blame-shifting games

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.879
in front of me.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.759
Forget it.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.120
You'll understand when Xiaoxiao wakes up.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.960
Get out.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.159
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.000
Get out of here!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.800
Get out!

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.360
Bai Yuchen, right?

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:36.759
Liar's get what's coming to them.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.560
Hey, you...

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.479
Shengzi, let's go.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.520
No manners.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.599
Yaqing.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.080
Haven't you realized yet

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.439
what kind of person Zhao Fengsheng is?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.800
Erni.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.840
Manager Bai is our family's savior.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.439
Be more polite to him from now on.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.520
Savior.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.960
It was the right thing to do.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.919
I'll beat you to death!

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.439
Savior.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.120
Yaqing!

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.240
What are you doing?

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:57.240
Erni.

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:58.879
Listen to your auntie.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.280
A leopard can't change its spots.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.919
Manager Bai comes from a good family,

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.280
and has a kind heart.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.759
I heard from your mom you're dating.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.000
Good choice.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.719
Dating?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.680
Me, dating him?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.080
You're all going to be badly fooled.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.879
I'm done with this.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:17.560
Yaqing!

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:18.759
If you dare follow me,

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.759
I'll crack your skull open.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.439
You should fix that temper.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.080
Yaqing.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080
Manager Bai, her temper is bad.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.039
Her temper isn't very good.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.800
Get lost.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.120
You witch!

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.639
You dare disobey me?

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.240
Do you want to live or not?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.879
Brother Shengzi helped me and my brother.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.319
I can't kill him.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.879
You witch, you dare talk to me about favors?

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.039
Am I being too nice to you?

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.120
Even if you kill me,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.120
I won't do it.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.439
Not bad.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.919
Since you're so tough,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.639
I'll give you a gift.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.159
Open it.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.399
This...

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.160
What did you do to my brother?

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.399
What did you do to my brother?!

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.160
You thought hiding him in the countryside

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160
would stop me from finding him?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720
Don't worry.

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.480
Your brother isn't dead... yet.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.040
One finger is just a warning.

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.920
If you don't obey again,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.199
next time you'll see more than a hand.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.040
Kill Zhao Fengsheng.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.959
I'll let you and your brother

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.000
leave Bianshui.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.560
We risked our lives to save Xiaoxiao.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.839
Only for this pretty boy

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.959
to steal the credit.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.000
I'll make him pay.

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.079
Forget it.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.959
Picking a fight with a coward

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:26.160
is a waste of effort.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.439
I didn't save Xiaoxiao for the credit.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.040
It's Painted Face and Xiaoqian

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.399
I'm worried about.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.560
You...

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.800
You know already?

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.079
It was about a year ago.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.959
Xiaoqian insisted on going out to work.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.480
Painted Face was naturally worried.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.800
The siblings had a big fight.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.519
That girl Xiaoqian is so stubborn.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.480
She ran away secretly in the middle of the night.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.639
Painted Face went out to look for her.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.879
For so long, there's been

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.040
no word from him.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.920
Crow...

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.399
I'll wipe him out.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.079
Xiaoman is looking for me.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.959
I'm heading out.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.319
You'll die by a woman's hand one day.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.759
Brother Shengzi.

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.959
Zhou Xiaoman.

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.439
Brother Shengzi.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.279
Thank you for saving me that day.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.839
All my words

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
are in this drink.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.959
Didn't Gangzi go to find you?

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.199
You didn't run into him?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.040
Brother Shengzi.

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.720
I came to see you.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.319
This wine is smooth.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.759
Let me have a few more with you.

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.399
Put your clothes back on.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.000
Brother Shengzi, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.040
But my brother is in their hands.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.079
Remember when we were kids,

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.639
you were always following

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.160
me, Painted Face, and Gangzi around,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.000
chasing us for candy.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.240
Zhou Xiaoman.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.480
Your brother is safe.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.279
What?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.680
Brother!

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.199
I'm back.

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:35.120
It's good to have you back.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.680
Why'd you have to get so tall?

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.439
Brother Painted Face!

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:41.720
What did you say about my brother?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.399
I got him out of here.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.120
Little brother!

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.759
Are you okay?

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:53.439
Little brother!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.439
Sis!

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.240
I'm fine.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.199
Brother Painted Face saved me.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.199
I'm already out of Bianshui.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.720
You don't have to work for Crow anymore.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.839
That's good.

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:05.160
That's good.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.199
Brother Shengzi.

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:13.680
I'm sorry.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:15.240
Forget it.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.079
You were forced into it.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.279
You can stay in Old Street from now on.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.160
And also...

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:22.839
Gangzi treats you well.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.319
Never mind, I won't say more.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.639
You know it yourself.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.480
Shengzi!

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.240
You...

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.519
Painted Face!

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:57.039
It really is you!

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.159
You've been gone for months!

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.120
Did you find Xiaoqian?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:01.759
I knew it!

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.320
That girl's been clever since she was little.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320
As long as she's safe.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.919
What are you doing?

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:08.879
Look at you.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.200
I'm not the one who stinks.

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:12.759
Alright, stop messing around.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.440
Xiaoqian is still in Crow's hands.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.200
I thought so.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.639
He's got some nerve.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.639
Enough, Gangzi.

00:09:25.759 --> 00:09:27.360
Painted Face stayed with Crow on purpose

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.120
because he hadn't found Xiaoqian yet.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.360
Don't go charging in like a headless fly.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.159
Brother.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:35.120
Your raid on the cargo ship last time

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.759
spooked the Daixiang Village gang.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.919
They'll probably move their hiding spot.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.200
If Xiaoqian really is with them,

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:42.840
she'll be moved too.

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.399
That's when I'll find her.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.519
Contact us once you locate the hideout.

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:52.279
We'll go with you to save Xiaoqian.

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.080
We'll take down those Daixiang Village bastards.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:55.759
I'll get going then.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.759
Don't worry.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:09.320
Miss Qian.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:12.159
Manager Bai, don't just focus on work.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.919
Pay more attention to Yaqing.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.320
We can't let her be fooled again

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.600
by that hoodlum Zhao.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.559
I've already called Yaqing's home

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:20.000
several times.

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.679
As soon as Yaqing hears my voice,

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:22.919
she hangs up.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.159
Maybe you could help me, Miss Qian?

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.240
Yaqing is just too deeply infatuated.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.639
I need a chance to ask her out.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.720
Manager Bai, you must seize this opportunity.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.960
Thank you, Miss Qian.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.120
Don't worry, Miss Qian.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.480
I'll definitely make a good impression.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.279
Such a long way.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.279
I told you to take a taxi.

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:51.279
But you insisted on walking.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.159
Did you just want to carry me?

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:54.879
Just to attend a business association meeting.

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:56.440
You dragged me all the way out here.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:58.120
I'm starving to death.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.559
I shouldn't have come.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.240
What do you mean?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.200
You just don't want to be with me, do you?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.480
Are you crazy?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.399
Twisting my ear again!

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:07.200
Is it because Zhou Xiaoman is back?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.159
You don't want to go out with me.

00:11:08.159 --> 00:11:09.639
What does Zhou Xiaoman have to do with this?

00:11:10.919 --> 00:11:12.080
Tell me the truth, damn it.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200
Did you sleep with her?

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.879
No.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:14.840
Absolutely not.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.320
I'm a fine young man who's kept myself pure.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.320
A fortune teller once said,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.919
as long as I remain a virgin,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.399
I'll be invincible.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.080
You're so full of it.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.559
Let go of Yaqing!

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.159
Xiao Bai.

00:11:30.919 --> 00:11:32.559
You dare show your face to me?

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.440
Yaqing.

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.279
I wanted to pick you up by car.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.000
But your aunt told me

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.399
you were walking here with him.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.559
Why make things hard for yourself?

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.279
It's not that...

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:45.039
Zhao Fengsheng, let me tell you.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.159
Miss Qian invited me today

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:48.879
to have me introduce Yaqing

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:50.480
to some high-end people.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.279
You understand?

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:53.080
Look at yourself.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.240
A place like this

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.440
is not for someone like you.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.240
Bai Yuchen!

00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:59.240
Shengzi came with me.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:01.000
Watch your mouth!

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.519
Yaqing.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.000
Before,

00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:06.960
you lived in the Old Street.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.200
That kind of dump.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.919
You never had the chance to meet better people.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.240
But after today, you'll understand.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.960
Sticking with this country bumpkin

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.759
is a total waste of your youth.

00:12:16.559 --> 00:12:17.559
Enough nonsense!

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:19.279
I've been hungry all day.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.159
If we can eat here, let's eat.

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:20.840
If not,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.159
I'll take Erni to a food stall.

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:23.840
Shengzi.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:26.240
Tianyu personally called to invite us today.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.559
I want to use this chance

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.159
to let her see you in a new light.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.480
Fine.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.039
As long as he doesn't cause trouble,

00:12:33.159 --> 00:12:34.720
I'll be a good boy.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.799
Bai Yuchen.

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.360
Where's Tianyu?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.679
She's busy with work.

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:42.960
She'll probably be here soon.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.000
Let's go in first.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.879
Let's go.

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.080
Come on.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.639
Don't hold his arm.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:48.960
Lead the way.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.559
Yaqing, this way.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.240
Boss?

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.039
Xiao Jiu?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.000
It really is you.
