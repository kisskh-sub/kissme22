00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:02.534
(The Over Zero and Below Zero group dates...)

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.575
(were decided at random.)

00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:05.944
(Yeong Gyeong, Ji Won, Ye Eun, Ji Yung and Hyeon Jun)

00:00:05.945 --> 00:00:07.275
(Over Zero Date)

00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:09.174
(The two older women...)

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.685
(didn't speak a word during the date without Sang Won.)

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:15.585
(Go for it, noona!)

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:18.585
(To one person, it was a happy date.)

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.024
(To another, it was an uncomfortable date.)

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:23.255
(Isn't the date partner the important part?)

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:25.155
(True...) Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.595
(Feelings were mixed during the Over Zero date.)

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.334
(Bon Hee, So Hyun, Mu Jin, Sang Hyeon, and Sang Won)

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:30.835
(Below Zero Date)

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.265
(Falling down)

00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:35.234
(The two younger men rushed over...)

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.635
(to So Hyun, who had fallen.)

00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.104
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon hesitates.)

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.175
(It's hot.)

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.144
(I was a little disappointed in Sang Hyeon.)

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.375
(I couldn't tell what he was thinking.)

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:50.885
(So Hyun, upset, feels a new excitement.)

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:53.124
(Hey, )

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:55.655
(I wanted to talk to you about something.)

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.165
(I've been wanting to talk to Mu Jin more.)

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.095
Well, I totally can.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.064
(Both his feelings...)

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.164
(and your feelings are important.)

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.904
(I don't think it's right...)

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:07.904
(to become self-conscious and not talk to him at all.)

00:01:07.905 --> 00:01:09.274
(It may bother you, )

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:11.305
(but you told me it didn't.)

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:14.145
(How can it not bother me? Of course, it does.)

00:01:16.515 --> 00:01:19.145
(Finally, the moment they face each other's ages)

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:21.845
(I'm...)

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.215
I'm 27 years old.

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:24.715
(Kim Mu Jin)

00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:27.085
(27 years old, born in 1999)

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.424
I was born in 1987.

00:01:28.425 --> 00:01:30.125
(Gu Bon Hee, 39 years old, born in 1987)

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:33.595
(A 12-year gap... It worried me.)

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.635
(There's an age wall between the two now.)

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.194
(How old is Sang Won, )

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.234
(whom Ye Eun and Ji Won were most curious about?)

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:43.075
(Park Sang Won, 27 years old, born in 1999)

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.645
(I was shocked because he was younger than I imagined.)

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:48.975
(My mind went blank.)

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.944
Born in 1989.

00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:53.545
(Park Ye Eun, 37 years old, born in 1989)

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:55.885
(Park Ji Won, 36 years old, born in 1990)

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.754
(A 10-year gap for Ye Eun, )

00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.025
(and a 9-year gap for Ji Won!)

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:03.995
(Kim Sang Hyeon, 29 years old, born in 1997)

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:07.565
(Go So Hyun, 36 years old, born in 1990)

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.894
(A 7-year gap for So Hyun)

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.565
(Am I too old?)

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.435
(Has someone's heart changed after the age reveal?)

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.474
(What kind of change...)

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:21.545
(will Yeon House go through after the age reveal?)

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:23.674
- What a shocker. - Let's go inside.

00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:25.015
- For real. - Really?

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.445
(Hit with reality)

00:02:27.685 --> 00:02:29.915
- Was it a real shocker? - Totally.

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:31.984
Watch them carefully.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.755
Watch how they act from now on.

00:02:35.085 --> 00:02:38.855
(Bon Hee takes her stuff and leaves without a word.)

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.564
(And...)

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:42.495
(Getting up)

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:47.004
(Mu Jin follows after Bon Hee.)

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:48.104
He's unwavering.

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.835
(Mu Jin follows after Bon Hee.)

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:54.875
- Actually... - We're 12 years apart.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:56.444
(Laughing)

00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:57.614
- We're friends. - Yes.

00:02:57.615 --> 00:02:59.045
- Friends? - We had no idea.

00:02:59.615 --> 00:03:01.014
- Oh, no. - My gosh.

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:02.015
How cute.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.484
He's comforting her with a joke.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:04.615
That's so sweet.

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:06.454
Oh, gosh. What a guy.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:07.725
(SOOBIN, Jang Woo Young)

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:09.254
We're 12 years apart.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.754
(Laughing)

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:11.794
- We're friends. - Yes.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:13.265
- Friends? - We had no idea.

00:03:14.095 --> 00:03:16.064
- I kind of had a feeling. - It's...

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:17.134
Really?

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:18.434
Aren't you shocked?

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:21.704
No, I thought it was possible.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:24.204
You told me you were old.

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.045
- What? - You said you had a long career.

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.005
- What about the military? - I've already been discharged.

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:30.244
How?

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:31.674
Were you able to serve while working?

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.485
I took a leave of absence from work.

00:03:33.945 --> 00:03:35.484
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin ask long-awaited questions.)

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:36.585
I'm hungry.

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.955
- Were you surprised? - What?

00:03:40.385 --> 00:03:43.094
But you told me you were old.

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:44.354
- I did? - So I thought...

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:46.994
you were around 29 or 30 years old.

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:48.394
- Gosh. - I didn't say a thing.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.165
(Glaring)

00:03:50.935 --> 00:03:52.464
- Mu Jin is... - Mu Jin is no joke.

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.634
- He's acting... - That's witty of him.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.234
Yes, he's loosening up the mood.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.235
(So Hyun is curious about what Sang Hyeon thinks.)

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.705
(Watching Sang Hyeon)

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:02.975
(Exclaiming)

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:10.214
(Sang Hyeon doesn't strike up a conversation with So Hyun.)

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:11.585
Oh, no.

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:15.285
- Were you shocked? - Yes.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:17.355
I was. It was a huge surprise.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:19.824
After hearing your ages,

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.164
I just unconsciously call you "noona."

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:22.935
It happens. I say it naturally.

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:25.835
- Do you want to call us "noona?" - Noona...

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:27.465
I didn't think it was impossible.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.875
I thought Sang Hyeon would be older.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:37.044
(So Hyun and Sang Hyeon aren't talking to each other.)

00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:39.745
I feel bad for Sang Hyeon the most.

00:04:40.015 --> 00:04:41.485
Remember what So Hyun said?

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.554
"What if he's in a dilemma again?"

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.185
So Hyun can already feel it.

00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:49.655
I hope So Hyun doesn't get hurt too much.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:53.725
(Bon Hee and So Hyun's room)

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:56.995
What will he get by thinking so much?

00:04:57.435 --> 00:04:59.664
- Sang Hyeon does think a lot. - Right?

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.181
And a lot more when you get to know him.

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:02.935
They must be able to tell.

00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:05.404
He was next to me and kept saying, "I'm so nervous."

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.544
- Really? - Yes.

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:08.505
- "I'm so nervous" and such. - That he's nervous?

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:10.774
- Yes. - He seemed confused.

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:13.315
I'd like to know what he thinks.

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.384
Did he say he has never dated someone older?

00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:17.485
- I don't remember. - He has never dated one.

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:20.425
I don't really care.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:21.725
Me neither.

00:05:22.485 --> 00:05:25.195
- But they might care. - Exactly.

00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:27.494
Because they've dated younger men before.

00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.264
- They have the experience. - Yes.

00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:30.664
(Bothered about the younger men's reactions...)

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:32.065
(after the age reveal)

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:36.474
The guys have become...

00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:38.334
more awkward after the age reveal.

00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:40.105
Things have changed a bit.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:42.775
- Out of the blue, right? - Yes.

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:46.214
Don't you finally understand?

00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:49.214
Like, "That's why he was all awkward."

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.314
True.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:52.454
"He's just a baby."

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.154
- The reason. - Yes.

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:56.125
The guys are just babies.

00:05:56.925 --> 00:05:59.695
(Mu Jin is preparing dinner in the kitchen.)

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:03.195
(Notices Mu Jin)

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:05.865
He's already smiling.

00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:08.104
He's smiling.

00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:09.805
Everyone is coming downstairs.

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:13.705
Should I heat up some rice?

00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:16.245
(Dropping)

00:06:17.475 --> 00:06:18.644
Did you get changed into something more comfortable?

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:21.344
- He's following her around. - Just the top.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:22.891
(He stops cooking and goes near Bon Hee.)

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:24.755
How old did you think I'd be?

00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:27.484
At first, I thought...

00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:30.525
you'd be either 28 or 29.

00:06:30.695 --> 00:06:33.094
But you said, "I've got a long work experience."

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:34.224
You did, didn't you?

00:06:34.225 --> 00:06:36.434
- I said I had a long work life. - Right, a long one.

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:37.894
You did. That's why...

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:40.364
I imagined you'd be...

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:41.734
in your early 30s...

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.674
and was kind of relieved.

00:06:43.675 --> 00:06:45.335
Goodness. To think he's 27 years old...

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.445
That was the reason...

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:51.275
I thought you might be older than expected.

00:06:52.645 --> 00:06:53.815
You shouldn't have said it.

00:06:54.245 --> 00:06:55.314
(Laughing)

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:56.884
What would've happened if I hadn't?

00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:59.154
Because you said you had a long experience.

00:06:59.155 --> 00:07:01.554
"I have a longer work life than expected."

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:02.754
That's what you told me.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:04.625
You acted as if you were older.

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:06.464
- I was trying to charm you. - How?

00:07:06.465 --> 00:07:07.625
I was trying to be charming.

00:07:08.825 --> 00:07:10.334
- See that? - "I was trying to charm you."

00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:11.535
"I was trying to be charming."

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.834
Mu Jin has that way of talking that captivates you.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:15.964
"I was trying to be charming."

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.205
- That's far from how he spoke. - It's captivating.

00:07:18.335 --> 00:07:19.344
That's so not him.

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:21.174
It may sound cheesy.

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:22.375
"I was trying to be charming."

00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:23.875
But he was captivating.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:25.614
- No way. - That's something to learn.

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:27.485
No way. That was not like Mu Jin at all.

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:29.954
(You acted as if you were older.)

00:07:29.955 --> 00:07:33.685
(I was trying to charm you.)

00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:35.584
- You may see me as young. - I see.

00:07:35.585 --> 00:07:37.345
- So you just... - I'm the younger one here.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:40.224
Like, "Let's get to know each other without any walls?"

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:41.265
Yes.

00:07:43.435 --> 00:07:45.864
- Mu Jin acts like a pillar. - Right.

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:48.005
Mu Jin isn't bothered by anything.

00:07:48.035 --> 00:07:49.035
He doesn't care.

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:50.374
(Mu Jin helps Bon Hee feel at ease.)

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:52.175
Amazing.

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:55.645
(Meanwhile, Sang Hyeon still hasn't said a word.)

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:59.945
- Do you have a lot on your mind? - Me? No.

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.515
- Do you? - Later on...

00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:04.255
How about a walk?

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:05.514
- A walk? - A walk?

00:08:05.515 --> 00:08:06.525
(Nodding)

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:14.194
Let's go, everyone. Let's eat.

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:17.895
(The first dinner together after the age reveal)

00:08:18.265 --> 00:08:19.295
(Glancing)

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:22.065
(Glancing)

00:08:23.635 --> 00:08:24.834
(Thinking)

00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:27.644
(Unlike the other days, it's a quiet mealtime.)

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:28.675
Here it goes again.

00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:35.785
Why is it... Why is the atmosphere kind of...

00:08:37.315 --> 00:08:38.315
stressful?

00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:41.484
- It's tough. I don't want to... - Same here.

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:42.795
This is hard for me.

00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:45.095
- Is it? - Isn't it hard?

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.864
It'll get better.

00:08:46.865 --> 00:08:48.595
- Really? - Of course.

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:54.165
(Thinking)

00:08:54.935 --> 00:08:56.375
That busy mind of yours.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:59.405
You're a lump of thoughts.

00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:01.305
A lump of thoughts.

00:09:02.005 --> 00:09:03.575
What's their age gap again?

00:09:04.075 --> 00:09:05.215
- Seven. - Seven.

00:09:05.915 --> 00:09:07.814
- That's not small. - No.

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:12.315
(Dinner time is filled with worries and silence.)

00:09:14.085 --> 00:09:15.824
(Everyone cleans up after the meal.)

00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:16.855
Leave it here.

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:18.554
- I'll do it. - No, I will.

00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:20.664
Ji Won washes the dishes every single day.

00:09:20.665 --> 00:09:22.224
- Let me do it. - No, I will.

00:09:22.225 --> 00:09:24.094
- I've never washed the dishes. - I already have the gloves on.

00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.664
- I'll do it. - No, I will. It's okay.

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:27.934
- What a sweet guy. - It's my first time...

00:09:27.935 --> 00:09:28.935
doing the dishes.

00:09:29.305 --> 00:09:30.305
How kind of him.

00:09:31.035 --> 00:09:33.104
If you soap up the dishes,

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.581
I'll rinse and place them on the side.

00:09:34.605 --> 00:09:35.675
Got it.

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.244
Do you not need gloves?

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.445
(Nodding)

00:09:40.885 --> 00:09:41.985
Do you not wear them?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.854
- I do, - Wear them.

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:45.295
But I don't need them at the moment.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.355
Your pretty hands will get rough.

00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:49.385
(Smiling)

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:52.054
(Showing off)

00:09:52.055 --> 00:09:53.394
(Look at my hand.)

00:09:53.395 --> 00:09:54.395
Oh, my.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.975
- What do you think? - It's pretty.

00:10:05.975 --> 00:10:08.175
Doing the dishes together helps you do them in no time.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.145
I'm the master of doing dishes.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:13.085
I don't like doing the dishes.

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:15.515
Doing the dishes?

00:10:16.145 --> 00:10:17.154
I'll do it.

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:18.854
(Then I'll do it.)

00:10:18.855 --> 00:10:20.655
- You're good at doing the dishes. - Yes.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:23.795
Don't tell me...

00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.824
I'm being tactless...

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.094
and being a third wheel, am I?

00:10:27.095 --> 00:10:29.325
- No way. - Don't say that.

00:10:32.905 --> 00:10:34.604
You haven't toured the whole place yet, right?

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:36.975
No, I haven't looked around in detail.

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:40.975
It's really quiet.

00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:42.804
- Isn't it? - Yes.

00:10:42.805 --> 00:10:44.285
To think there was a place like this.

00:10:45.015 --> 00:10:47.115
He's now taking her to dark places.

00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:49.954
There's even a cushion.

00:10:49.955 --> 00:10:53.255
(The two sit in a quiet place behind Yeon House.)

00:10:55.785 --> 00:10:57.154
Were you not shocked...

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:59.024
after hearing about my age? Be honest.

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:00.065
- Honestly? - Yes.

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:02.795
- Honestly... - Yes, were you not shocked?

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:05.995
Honestly, I swear I wasn't shocked.

00:11:06.095 --> 00:11:07.565
But how?

00:11:07.665 --> 00:11:10.004
Was the year printed on the photo?

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:14.945
- There was a number on it. - I see.

00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:18.074
It was 20-something.

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:20.945
I couldn't tell if it was 2004 or 2006.

00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:24.915
(Secret Room on the first day)

00:11:25.855 --> 00:11:30.254
(The year taken was blurry on Bon Hee's photo.)

00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:31.955
- It wasn't clear. - I see.

00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:38.434
(Mu Jin looked at it closely to figure out if it was 2004 or 2006.)

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:40.265
Trying to figure it out somehow.

00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:41.935
One way or another.

00:11:42.365 --> 00:11:46.505
I did think it was from when you were in middle or high school.

00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:49.715
When I made a rough calculation,

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:53.344
I thought we were at least ten years apart.

00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:55.415
I was 6 years old back in 2004.

00:11:57.155 --> 00:11:59.414
Right. When I thought of it like that,

00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:01.525
I kind of guessed our age gap.

00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:04.825
That's amazing.

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:11.395
Did you not think much after hearing about my age?

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:15.235
I'd be lying if I said nothing crossed my mind.

00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:17.835
- Because the gap is quite big... - Right.

00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:20.604
You kept saying...

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.844
- you could go on a blind date... - Yes.

00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:25.414
If the age gap was 4 to 7 years.

00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:28.515
But since our age gap is over ten years,

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:33.054
it's impossible if we're not in a dilemma.

00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:35.485
- True. - It made me think a little.

00:12:37.555 --> 00:12:38.854
(Bon Hee has a lot on her mind about the age gap.)

00:12:38.855 --> 00:12:39.925
I'd be the same as her.

00:12:43.265 --> 00:12:44.434
Without any pressure,

00:12:44.435 --> 00:12:46.535
I'm going to do as I feel.

00:12:47.335 --> 00:12:49.205
I'm going to act without thinking too deeply.

00:12:56.245 --> 00:13:01.745
(The age gap between the two can't be ignored.)

00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:05.815
Let's have a more serious talk later and go back for now.

00:13:18.195 --> 00:13:23.305
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin return without any clear conclusion.)

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:27.045
Great work today.

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.915
- See you tomorrow, noona. - Bye.

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.745
- "Noona." - He's cute.

00:13:33.215 --> 00:13:34.315
That was natural.

00:13:37.085 --> 00:13:38.954
(After parting from Mu Jin)

00:13:38.955 --> 00:13:40.725
I wonder what she's thinking.

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:42.585
I mean, Bon Hee.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.355
(Sighing)

00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:49.695
(Bon Hee is getting lost in her growing thoughts.)

00:13:52.035 --> 00:13:55.604
I had a feeling there could be a guy 12 years younger than I am,

00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:57.635
but little did I think it'd be Mu Jin.

00:13:58.775 --> 00:14:01.104
It's true that we have an age gap.

00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:03.175
I can't just ignore...

00:14:03.745 --> 00:14:06.884
Korea's culture as well as the reality.

00:14:06.885 --> 00:14:08.915
Those are what worry me.

00:14:09.685 --> 00:14:12.715
And of course, what others may think of us bothers me.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:16.385
Thoughts like those are what go through my head.

00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:20.594
What's going on in Mu Jin's head?

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:22.025
Being together makes them happy.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:23.534
- But once they're apart, - Part ways,

00:14:23.535 --> 00:14:25.494
- and they're in a dilemma. - the two are filled with thoughts.

00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:26.565
Gosh, this is crazy.

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:29.065
This is a tough one.

00:14:30.075 --> 00:14:32.404
Yes, that's what you call reality. A harsh reality.

00:14:32.405 --> 00:14:33.405
Exactly.

00:14:34.005 --> 00:14:36.174
(Mu Jin is as confused as Bon Hee.)

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.545
(Sighing)

00:14:40.015 --> 00:14:42.644
He may act all mannerly up front, but when alone, reality hits him.

00:14:42.645 --> 00:14:43.715
Of course.

00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:50.694
Mu Jin set Bon Hee at ease.

00:14:50.695 --> 00:14:53.264
But the moment he returned to his room, he said,

00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:54.665
"This is crazy," and sighed deeply.

00:14:55.225 --> 00:14:58.234
I guess feelings and reality are two different things.

00:14:58.235 --> 00:14:59.235
- Yes. - Right?

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:03.004
Could that sigh, and his saying "This is crazy,"

00:15:03.005 --> 00:15:05.174
be about how deeply Bon Hee is thinking about...

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:06.675
the situation?

00:15:06.845 --> 00:15:07.874
Maybe.

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.344
- That's a possibility. - Yes.

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.074
If I were in that situation,

00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:12.815
it'd be like, "What now? This is crazy."

00:15:13.115 --> 00:15:15.184
But with Mu Jin, it might be more like,

00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:16.814
"What should I do..."

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:20.224
"so Bon Hee doesn't feel a wall between us?"

00:15:20.225 --> 00:15:22.125
- "This is crazy." - Right.

00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:23.225
I agree.

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:26.964
Say the woman you're interested in...

00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:29.424
turns out to be 12 years older than you.

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:30.534
(What if she's 12 years older than you?)

00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:33.534
If I thought the age gap was only 5 or 6 years...

00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:35.004
and went on a date,

00:15:35.005 --> 00:15:37.075
but then found out she was actually 12 years older,

00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:41.244
I honestly couldn't say my feelings wouldn’t change.

00:15:41.245 --> 00:15:42.845
That's very honest.

00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:45.245
- It would put you in a dilemma. - Yes.

00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:49.244
(Ji Yung is in the 2nd-floor living room.)

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:50.255
The youngest.

00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:53.554
- Would you like some peaches? - Yes, please.

00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:56.154
- Who is it? Who is he talking to? - So Hyun.

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:58.794
- Is everyone still tidying up? - It's all clean now.

00:15:58.795 --> 00:16:00.164
- Is it? - Yes.

00:16:00.165 --> 00:16:02.094
Ji Yung is interested in So Hyun, right?

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:03.534
- Yes. - Ice skating...

00:16:03.535 --> 00:16:04.535
can really leave you sore.

00:16:04.536 --> 00:16:05.771
You must have used unfamiliar muscles.

00:16:05.795 --> 00:16:07.904
True.

00:16:07.905 --> 00:16:09.705
It's been ages since I last went ice skating.

00:16:10.675 --> 00:16:12.035
You've lost a lot of weight.

00:16:12.675 --> 00:16:14.504
Compared to when I first joined the house?

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:15.545
Is that so?

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:16.714
The messed-up lifestyle...

00:16:16.715 --> 00:16:17.944
- makes it tough. - Right?

00:16:17.945 --> 00:16:20.685
(Taking a bite of the peach)

00:16:21.445 --> 00:16:23.085
- It's good. - Right?

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:27.125
- There were two left. - I see.

00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:29.754
- There's only 1 now. - When I heard you wanted 1,

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:31.754
I secretly took it and cut it up.

00:16:31.755 --> 00:16:33.095
That's cute.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:34.864
What kind of fruit do you like?

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:36.894
- Me? I like peaches the most. - Peaches?

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:38.064
Hard ones or soft ones?

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.404
Either. I love all kinds of peaches.

00:16:40.405 --> 00:16:42.325
(Ji Yung remembered that So Hyun likes peaches.)

00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:43.634
(Well done me, right?)

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.604
Thank you so much.

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:48.204
I can't finish it all. It'd be better to share.

00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:50.875
(Ji Yung's cute peach flirting toward So Hyun)

00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.985
When were you born? In 2000?

00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:56.044
- Are you shocked? - No.

00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:57.054
(Shaking her head)

00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:58.115
Did you see it coming?

00:16:58.185 --> 00:17:00.454
I wasn't sure about the exact year,

00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:04.424
but I had a feeling that you'd be the youngest.

00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:06.125
(Humming)

00:17:06.695 --> 00:17:08.365
I'm so glad...

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:13.564
I met you here. I mean it.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.104
Oh, my gosh!

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:17.405
- Did he confess his feelings? - Of course.

00:17:17.775 --> 00:17:21.544
Thank you for trying to talk to me,

00:17:21.545 --> 00:17:23.974
expressing your feelings,

00:17:23.975 --> 00:17:25.244
and talking nicely...

00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.414
to be considerate toward me.

00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:29.244
(So Hyun is thankful that he keeps expressing himself.)

00:17:29.245 --> 00:17:30.455
I'm so thankful.

00:17:31.355 --> 00:17:32.355
And I brought you peaches.

00:17:32.356 --> 00:17:34.284
I know! This was so touching.

00:17:34.285 --> 00:17:35.324
Right.

00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:38.895
Gosh. What are all the others doing?

00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:41.594
- They're frustrating. - What are they doing?

00:17:41.595 --> 00:17:43.264
- They can't even speak to you. - I even mentioned peaches.

00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:44.265
Exactly.

00:17:45.035 --> 00:17:46.065
I'm joking.

00:17:46.735 --> 00:17:49.065
It was so thoughtful of you. Thank you so much.

00:17:52.335 --> 00:17:54.075
You must date guys like him.

00:17:55.305 --> 00:17:56.675
A guy who has his eyes set on you.

00:17:57.315 --> 00:17:58.315
Right.

00:17:58.316 --> 00:18:00.076
(Ji Yung expressed his feelings once again.)

00:18:00.215 --> 00:18:02.214
And at first...

00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:03.614
(At that moment, Ji Won and Bon Hee are talking in the kitchen.)

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:07.654
I assumed Mu Jin would be in his late 20s.

00:18:07.655 --> 00:18:09.924
Like 28 or 29.

00:18:09.925 --> 00:18:11.395
That was my guess.

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.725
It feels different now that I know his actual age.

00:18:15.225 --> 00:18:17.064
And he said...

00:18:17.065 --> 00:18:19.034
he had lots of experience...

00:18:19.035 --> 00:18:20.534
and that I wouldn't be able to guess it.

00:18:20.535 --> 00:18:21.965
If he hadn't told that joke...

00:18:23.005 --> 00:18:26.944
- Why aren't you coming upstairs? - Oh, we were talking.

00:18:26.945 --> 00:18:29.205
Mu Jin just left.

00:18:30.715 --> 00:18:32.644
What were you two talking about?

00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:34.115
Should I not be here in my pajamas?

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.144
Should we go upstairs...

00:18:36.145 --> 00:18:37.985
so that we can talk comfortably on the floor?

00:18:40.085 --> 00:18:41.825
(Flustered)

00:18:42.055 --> 00:18:43.055
Didn't it look like...

00:18:43.056 --> 00:18:44.654
he meant to come and turned around?

00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:46.154
- He turned away so quickly. - Right.

00:18:46.155 --> 00:18:48.264
(All eyes are on Sang Won.)

00:18:48.265 --> 00:18:49.365
Where are you going?

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:52.135
- What? Just a moment. - Okay.

00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:54.205
"Just a moment."

00:18:54.865 --> 00:18:56.875
(Sighing deeply)

00:18:57.935 --> 00:18:59.535
Why is he going outside all of a sudden?

00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:01.104
He has nowhere to go now.

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:02.175
Is he going home?

00:19:02.275 --> 00:19:03.645
(Laughing)

00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:07.045
It's not time yet. It isn't over yet.

00:19:08.045 --> 00:19:10.015
Can we come over to your room, Ye Eun?

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:12.514
Of course. Come on over.

00:19:12.515 --> 00:19:13.755
Let's go right now.

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:17.824
(They're about to go upstairs and chat.)

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:20.064
I'll be upstairs after I talk to him.

00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:22.065
Sure. You and I will talk.

00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:24.095
Should we go to your room?

00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:27.005
That kid. Why did he have to come down now?

00:19:28.605 --> 00:19:30.505
- Sang Won? - Gosh.

00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:37.045
(Following Sang Won outside)

00:19:37.645 --> 00:19:40.544
(Amazed)

00:19:40.545 --> 00:19:43.585
Ji Won really is quick to act.

00:19:43.685 --> 00:19:45.184
People like her win it over.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.214
- Yes. - Exactly.

00:19:46.215 --> 00:19:47.215
(Action gets results.)

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:49.719
- Are you alone? - Sorry?

00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:51.279
Why are you here alone?

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:55.289
- I suddenly... - Is there a lot on your mind?

00:19:55.589 --> 00:19:57.458
Well, not because of the age reveal.

00:19:57.459 --> 00:20:00.728
Okay. Should we have a chat?

00:20:00.729 --> 00:20:01.729
Sure.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.599
I'm dying to know what they'll talk about.

00:20:06.099 --> 00:20:07.328
(Ji Won and Sang Won came back to the kitchen.)

00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:08.728
Let's talk here.

00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:09.738
Sure.

00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:14.539
(Ji Won and Sang Won came back to the kitchen.)

00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:20.809
(Gulping down)

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.379
If I'm being honest,

00:20:25.479 --> 00:20:26.989
I really...

00:20:27.689 --> 00:20:30.719
can't tell what's on your mind. I have no clue.

00:20:35.729 --> 00:20:37.229
I've been thinking a lot.

00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:41.228
I've been thinking about whether I could be...

00:20:41.229 --> 00:20:42.999
perfectly sincere while I'm here.

00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:47.109
But now that we've spent some time here...

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:48.739
and the program is almost ending,

00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:54.448
I realize that I was so worried about being sincere...

00:20:54.449 --> 00:20:55.649
that I lost my initiative.

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:59.388
I've been overly conscious of others too.

00:20:59.389 --> 00:21:00.595
(He couldn't make up his mind.)

00:21:00.619 --> 00:21:02.489
The best way for me to express my feelings...

00:21:02.589 --> 00:21:05.089
was to send that text message.

00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:06.789
But...

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.910
(His most active expression was the Love QR message.)

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:11.329
But I can tell you for sure...

00:21:11.629 --> 00:21:14.199
that you don't have to be stressed out because of me.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:15.898
- I'm not stressed out. - Honestly...

00:21:15.899 --> 00:21:20.039
I just didn't want to give you pressure.

00:21:20.439 --> 00:21:23.078
Like you had such worries,

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:25.079
I also had my worries.

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:29.779
Now that I'm in my 30s,

00:21:29.879 --> 00:21:31.319
I also lost my initiative.

00:21:32.849 --> 00:21:35.548
"What if my age is an obstacle for him?"

00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:36.558
That keeps occurring to me.

00:21:36.559 --> 00:21:38.358
- Right. - That's true.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:40.988
I've dated guys who were way younger than me,

00:21:40.989 --> 00:21:42.229
and in the end,

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:47.429
the age difference wasn't exactly a problem.

00:21:48.369 --> 00:21:49.999
That's why I decided to come here.

00:21:50.299 --> 00:21:51.698
(Nodding)

00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:54.409
I'm curious about who you are,

00:21:55.069 --> 00:21:58.539
and I wonder if I can be romantically attracted to you.

00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:01.679
At the moment, you're the only one I'm interested in.

00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:03.678
(Ji Won clearly expresses her feelings.)

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.019
She's so honest.

00:22:05.749 --> 00:22:06.989
Anyway,

00:22:08.949 --> 00:22:10.588
I just don't want you to feel stressed out.

00:22:10.589 --> 00:22:13.689
You don't have to worry about that.

00:22:13.759 --> 00:22:14.988
And I want to add...

00:22:14.989 --> 00:22:16.575
that I had never felt pressured because of you.

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.758
Never.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:19.028
- That's good. - I want you to know that.

00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:20.699
That's good.

00:22:22.229 --> 00:22:23.469
- Let's get going. - Yes.

00:22:24.639 --> 00:22:26.169
We've still got time.

00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:32.978
(Sang Won came to Ye Eun after talking to Ji Won.)

00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:34.049
- Come in. - Seriously?

00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:37.349
It's Sang Won.

00:22:38.119 --> 00:22:40.489
- Do you want to talk to Ye Eun? - Yes.

00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:42.618
Let me just get changed.

00:22:42.619 --> 00:22:43.689
Take your time.

00:22:46.019 --> 00:22:48.688
- Sang Won went to her? - Yes. Just like that.

00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:49.929
Right after talking to Ji Won.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.869
Yes, those two have to talk now.

00:22:54.629 --> 00:22:55.898
(Sang Won wants to make up his mind after talking to Ye Eun as well.)

00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:58.739
Please have a chat, you two.

00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:07.199
I wonder what they'll talk about.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:11.319
How do you feel?

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:13.689
"How do you feel?"

00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:15.888
You know, about the age gap.

00:23:15.889 --> 00:23:18.319
We have to share our thoughts before we start.

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:21.829
Right. Because you're younger?

00:23:22.459 --> 00:23:23.459
Not really.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.629
I'm just younger than you expected.

00:23:28.299 --> 00:23:31.198
I like it, though.

00:23:31.199 --> 00:23:32.199
What?

00:23:32.299 --> 00:23:34.409
I know I shouldn't be this blunt,

00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:36.379
but I don't mind.

00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:38.909
Right. She doesn't mind.

00:23:40.579 --> 00:23:43.019
What do you think, though? I'm not sure what you're thinking.

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:45.579
It feels like you're fond of me, but...

00:23:48.389 --> 00:23:49.789
Do you think we're compatible?

00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:52.319
Do you?

00:23:52.719 --> 00:23:54.159
I'm not so sure about that.

00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:57.899
If I'm being perfectly honest...

00:23:58.259 --> 00:24:00.668
Well, I told you that I preferred someone who was easy to talk to...

00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:02.349
and that good chemistry meant a lot to me.

00:24:02.469 --> 00:24:03.538
But I personally felt...

00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:08.439
that I had better chemistry with Ji Won.

00:24:08.969 --> 00:24:11.039
- Because... - Oh, no. She's upset.

00:24:11.339 --> 00:24:13.008
The most decisive moment was yesterday.

00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:15.649
I could directly compare the two yesterday.

00:24:16.304 --> 00:24:20.273
And when I was on a date with her first,

00:24:20.274 --> 00:24:22.574
I was more playful.

00:24:23.174 --> 00:24:25.214
But when I went to Seoul Arts High School with you,

00:24:25.274 --> 00:24:27.283
we talked about serious stuff...

00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:28.384
in a calm manner.

00:24:28.744 --> 00:24:30.554
Although I liked having serious chats,

00:24:30.984 --> 00:24:34.653
it didn't feel like the type of chat I normally preferred.

00:24:34.654 --> 00:24:38.354
I couldn't even tell if our conversation was going well.

00:24:41.994 --> 00:24:43.534
I'll be honest.

00:24:44.394 --> 00:24:46.864
I'm happy when I'm with you,

00:24:48.034 --> 00:24:50.674
and I want to keep talking to you.

00:24:51.304 --> 00:24:53.604
I want to go on dates with you, and you're on my mind.

00:24:53.974 --> 00:24:57.673
I believe that those prove that you're the type of person...

00:24:57.674 --> 00:24:58.944
I want to date.

00:24:59.484 --> 00:25:02.384
While I was here,

00:25:03.184 --> 00:25:05.853
you were the one that made me feel that way.

00:25:05.854 --> 00:25:07.023
(You were the one I was attracted to.)

00:25:07.024 --> 00:25:08.683
I love how honest she is.

00:25:08.684 --> 00:25:11.353
That's why I kept expressing my feelings for you.

00:25:11.354 --> 00:25:14.563
I also sent the Love QR messages to you.

00:25:14.564 --> 00:25:16.324
(Ye Eun also tells him her honest thoughts.)

00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:20.234
To be honest,

00:25:21.134 --> 00:25:23.074
you were the only one on my mind.

00:25:24.234 --> 00:25:25.234
Every day.

00:25:27.174 --> 00:25:29.274
So, I want to talk to you more,

00:25:29.744 --> 00:25:32.374
but I'm walking on eggshells around you...

00:25:32.814 --> 00:25:34.813
because you seem to have a lot on your mind.

00:25:34.814 --> 00:25:39.214
Also, you told me that you needed to clear your mind.

00:25:39.524 --> 00:25:40.953
I wanted to stop doubting.

00:25:40.954 --> 00:25:44.594
Yes, so I didn't want to rush you.

00:25:46.094 --> 00:25:47.694
But it wasn't like that.

00:25:48.024 --> 00:25:49.494
I was grateful,

00:25:49.894 --> 00:25:52.014
but it got more complicated due to the circumstances.

00:25:52.564 --> 00:25:54.963
But I want you...

00:25:54.964 --> 00:25:57.704
to express your feelings for the one you're attracted to.

00:25:58.034 --> 00:25:59.943
- I understand. - How would you solve...

00:25:59.944 --> 00:26:02.844
all those questions in eight days and be certain?

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:04.450
You can't.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.990
Just go to the one you're attracted to.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.989
(Sighing)

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.660
That's what I think.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:13.699
Seriously.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.800
(Scoffing)

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.270
Anyway...

00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:18.469
(Sighing)

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.539
You know, she's saying that to seem cool about it...

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.009
to protect her pride in the end,

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.680
and I know she'll instantly regret it.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.949
I'd rather do my best...

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.649
to win him over...

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.050
because it's all over in a few days.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.949
But on the one hand,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:41.760
I think it's Ye Eun's first time saying such a thing...

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.160
- in that tone. - Right.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:48.460
It might be a chance for Sang Won...

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.530
to have his frustration about her finally dissipated.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.099
He might have felt how sincere...

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.809
Ye Eun is...

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.890
since it's her first time saying that kind of thing.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.740
Anyway...

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.550
Well, it is a load off my chest.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:06.580
It felt like...

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.090
we were only scratching the surface until now.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.320
I also got it off my chest by saying it.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.430
I should organize my thoughts now.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.029
I wonder who Sang Won will pick after listening to both of them.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.930
Wait. Let me go to my room.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.770
(Stopping)

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.700
(Holding her hand)

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.409
You did a good job telling him.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.410
(Feeling relieved)

00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:38.610
She did.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.320
Until now,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.590
it felt like...

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.860
we were scratching the surface when we talked.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.960
But that weight has been lifted tonight.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.200
I'll just do my best to express my feelings...

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.300
and respect the way that I think...

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.740
he expresses himself.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.269
I'll wait for him and trust him.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.409
(After telling him her honest feelings, )

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.539
(she'll give him another chance.)

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.580
That's my plan.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:12.649
(So Hyun heads to the terrace on the 1st floor.)

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.880
(Stopping)

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:16.219
(Sang Hyeon)

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.419
So Hyun and Sang Hyeon?

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.250
(Sang Hyeon)

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.660
Are you working out?

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.159
I was about to go and talk to you.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.030
I know. I was about to hit a rut.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.429
Were you?

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.870
(So Hyun came to him for a chat.)

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.700
I couldn't tell what he was thinking.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.100
I learned how he thought of me the day before, but...

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.370
(During the Below Zero Date in the afternoon, )

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:45.110
(Sang Hyeon barely approached her.)

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.149
(Even when she fell hard...)

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.790
Oh, she fell really hard.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.149
Are you okay?

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.519
(He didn't really go to help her.)

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.990
Sang Hyeon is taking it too far.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:01.600
(Even when everyone's age was revealed, )

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.569
(his face stiffened after hearing her age.)

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.130
(She was 7 years older than him.)

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.969
He barely looked at me, didn't smile,

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.670
and avoided eye contact.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.640
I thought, "What is he thinking?"

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.940
"It's so frustrating."

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.050
"What is he trying to do?"

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:22.219
They're finally talking about it.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.619
(So Hyun was so frustrated that she came to talk to him.)

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.419
You asked to go on a walk earlier,

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.860
but you took too long to come to me.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.030
- So, I just came... - Did I?

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.489
To have a conversation.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.199
(She got tired of waiting and came to him.)

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.270
- Yes. - Let's go to the kitchen.

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:43.470
It's too bright, though.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.679
It's too bright. Can we go to your room?

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.180
- Is it dark? Yes. - My room?

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.610
Sure.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.480
Then...

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.450
- What? - Then...

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.190
My room is so messy right now.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.190
I don't know if it'll be empty, though.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.860
It's pretty cold too.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.710
- We lowered the heat on purpose. - Is that Ji Yung?

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.229
- Ji Yung saw them. - We lowered the heat on purpose.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.769
(Ji Yung was alone when they walked in.)

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.900
It's too cold.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.899
(So Hyun misses him and walks by.)

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.969
It's too cold.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.110
(So Hyun misses him and walks by.)

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.509
Oh, no.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.510
He saw them walk into a room.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.150
It smells nice.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.580
Does it?

00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:29.619
Maybe it's the air freshener.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:30.650
I'll turn off the light.

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.589
Put this on.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:35.060
It won't get warm so soon.

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.400
(He hears So Hyun's voice in Sang Hyeon's room.)

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.600
(Peeking again)

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.369
(He kept touching his hair for no reason...)

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:55.039
(and eventually leaves.)

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.240
He left.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.419
I had a feeling that you wouldn't be so young.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.260
- I see. - I saw it coming.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.459
The age difference...

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:10.959
(Hesitant)

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.860
It's just...

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.769
I can't help but be concerned about it.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:18.429
I admired everyone else.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:20.939
Mu Jin and everyone, you know.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.199
They all said they didn't mind.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.169
The fact that they could confidently say that...

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.240
Yes.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.639
- It was just admirable. - I see.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:34.179
But I couldn't say it so confidently.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.779
I couldn't lie...

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.020
that I didn't care...

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.719
just because I was on the show.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.260
I've been trying...

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.989
to accept it.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.060
Okay.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.099
I was rather worried that you would think I was too childish.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.569
I felt ashamed of the things I did.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.040
That's why I kept quiet.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.109
(I see.)

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.510
Right. It made him reflect on himself.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.810
I'm just a child to you.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.750
That was constantly on my mind.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.649
What you've seen...

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:10.750
(Scoffing)

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.159
Why did you laugh? Why are you laughing?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.890
I'm serious right now.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.729
Okay. Maybe you're serious,

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.660
but I can't help but laugh.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.250
Do you want me to stop laughing?

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.270
No. You look scary when you're not smiling.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.810
But Sang Hyeon has a way of driving women crazy.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.180
He has a way of captivating them...

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.909
different from Mu Jin's.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.339
"I'm just a child to you."

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.309
When So Hyun heard,

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.879
"I'm just a child to you," she found him adorable.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.119
- Right. - Yes. She thought it was cute.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.690
- He's kind of whining. - Yes.

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.060
Like, "What should I do?"

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.910
You said you wanted to look me in the eye.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.160
Yes, let's do that.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.700
They're pretty close.

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.599
(Staring)

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600
(He can't make eye contact.)

00:33:01.601 --> 00:33:03.170
He can't look her in the eye again.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.710
Continue.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.510
From "I'm just a child to you."

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:12.979
(Scoffing)

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.219
(Exclaiming)

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.190
The more I talk about this...

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.420
- the more I... - The more...

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:22.890
"The more?"

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.360
The more stupid I feel.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.660
Okay.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.870
Oh, no.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.830
The older woman has to set him straight.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.539
(Thinking)

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.310
Anyway, I prefer...

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.979
a guy...

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.740
who takes the initiative in love.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.710
Yes.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:47.249
- But I never really saw that... - I never did that.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.779
From you.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.249
And I thought I was disappointed.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.520
- Do you get what I mean? - Yes.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.466
I told you that I've always been an overthinker.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.760
Yes, I get that you're an overthinker.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.229
That's what you said.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.729
So, I thought,

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.699
(She was upset that he never said anything after the age reveal.)

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.640
"Is it because I'm too old?"

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.439
"Is that why there's a lot on his mind?"

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.440
Or you could have been...

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.140
Well, I had no idea what was on your mind.

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.409
- This is a sidenote, - Okay.

00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:19.849
But I wanted to...

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.479
(When we revealed our ages)

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.619
smile at you.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.919
Okay. But you didn't really look at me.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.989
- No, I was staring at you at first. - You kept a straight face.

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.559
- Really? - I stared at you at first.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.399
I wanted to look at you and smile at you...

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.230
to tell you that I was okay.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.929
I was dying to do that,

00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:40.610
but I couldn't really look you in the eye.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:42.170
And then, I kind of...

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.609
(Laughing)

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.279
It's just that... It's actually quite hard for me.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.339
Oh, you're so frustrating.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.109
I also have a lot to say right now.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.909
- But I'm listening to... - Say it.

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:54.619
Please say it.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.850
- First off, - Yes.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.189
I was worried that you weren't...

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:02.459
actually interested in me when you approached me.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.290
I couldn't figure you out.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.599
(Genuinely shocked)

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.970
Wouldn't it be silly if I didn't mean it?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.399
- Why would I say... - I...

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.999
- I... - that I wanted to talk to you...

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.339
otherwise?

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.869
I was just afraid.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.980
That's all it is.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.880
I just...

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.550
I was just afraid.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.820
Afraid of what?

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.359
"What are my strengths?"

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.720
"What did she like about me to pick me?"

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.490
"It's not like I'm objectively good-looking."

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.700
You know, my life has been extremely ordinary.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.369
I've always considered myself to be...

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:48.169
the most average person here, right in the middle.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.170
Okay.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.540
But then, suddenly...

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.139
You, the lead role, came up and talked to me,

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.640
who played a small supporting role.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.210
- You came and talked to me. - I have a headache.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.550
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.789
I was kind of dumbfounded. That's how I felt.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.919
"What is this? What is going on?"

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.460
That's what I thought.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.859
(So Hyun asked Sang Hyeon to talk to her first.)

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.529
I wanted to talk to you.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.800
- Oh, really? - Yes.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.569
(He was surprised by her signals and didn't know what to do.)

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.510
- Oh, my goodness. - He didn't know what to do.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.380
I couldn't even imagine...

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:32.650
that someone like So Hyun would think highly of me.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.650
I feel daunted.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:36.580
It's natural for you to feel that way.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.650
(Sighing)

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.689
He still doesn't understand...

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.459
- why So Hyun likes him. - He's fixated on that thought.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.200
(He can't stop doubting the genuineness of her feelings.)

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:53.739
You and I are on different paths.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.139
"How can I show my honest feelings..."

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.709
"to someone whose feelings are not genuine?"

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.770
That's what I thought.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.410
- I mean, I thought... - That's so unfair. I feel wronged.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.610
I just feel wronged.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.050
(Frustrated)

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.190
(Looking at her nervously)

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.610
I'll get down on my knees before we continue talking.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.659
I couldn't stop such thoughts, so I couldn't do anything.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.329
I smiled at you and everything.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:29.569
Would that all have been fake?

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:33.109
But I wasn't sure if your feelings were genuine,

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.510
which drove me crazy.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.179
So when I found out about our age difference...

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.950
(So Hyun never knew Sang Hyeon misunderstood her.)

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.190
I'll go to the bathroom. This is so frustrating.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.689
(So Hyun tries to calm herself first.)

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.390
I'm speechless.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.640
I guess there was a story in Sang Hyeon's head...

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.039
which he thought could be true.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.640
- He totally got the wrong idea. - Right.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.579
From our perspective...

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.409
We all saw how hard So Hyun tried to win his heart...

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.209
by doing everything she could think of...

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.720
while worrying about what should be her next move.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.420
I'm not so sure about it,

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.089
but if Sang Hyeon is watching this,

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:23.219
- he probably feels bad about it. - He must feel terrible about it.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.501
(Sang Hyeon completely misunderstood So Hyun's feelings.)

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:27.500
How old did you think I was?

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.330
I'm curious.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.369
I was confused.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:34.970
I thought you might even be as young as 25 years old.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.970
Honestly, I was a little worried if that was the case.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:43.810
Now you know my age.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.080
But it doesn't matter, does it?

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.219
- Does it? - Right.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.819
I don't think it matters.

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:54.260
I see. I wanted to know that.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.589
How I think about our age difference?

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.890
I wondered how you thought after hearing my age.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.829
How did you feel when you heard my age?

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:03.999
- Me? - Yes.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.870
It didn't make me worry or anything like that.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.946
I guess it doesn't matter if you really like the person.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.840
The one who has deeper feelings.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.040
"My feelings haven't changed."

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.010
That's what crossed my mind.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.049
Right. It doesn't matter because he likes her.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.020
(Even after knowing her age, Hyeon Jun still likes Yeong Gyeong.)

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360
You see...

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.759
I've always wanted to get married early.

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.000
- Really? - Yes.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.200
It's so soon.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:38.540
He's talking about marriage at this point?

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.839
I've always wanted to get married early.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.140
- Really? - Yes.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.540
I have positive thoughts about marriage.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.420
I believe that marriage brings stability.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:58.720
And I need stability in my life...

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:01.889
because I don't think my job is stable.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.019
(Hyeon Jun starts talking about marriage unexpectedly.)

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.589
I mean, when I come home after work...

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.330
Yeong Gyeong must be taken aback.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.870
If the family I started welcomes me,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.170
I think I would feel stable.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.940
That's why I've always wanted...

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.310
to get married early.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:25.350
I honestly see marriage as a very good thing.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:26.880
What do you think?

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.380
He thinks too far away.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:30.750
About what?

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.550
About what I just said.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.859
(Thinking)

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.760
- Well... About marriage? - Yes.

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.669
I've never seen Yeong Gyeong taken aback since the beginning.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.339
Well... To be honest, as I don't even have a boyfriend...

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:48.340
Oh, okay.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.039
I'm asking this out of pure curiosity.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.739
I want to know how you think about marriage.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.680
I see. What I can tell you for sure is...

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.380
I never want to be in a marriage that looks good...

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.919
only from the outside.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.520
It's so much better to live alone than living in such a marriage.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.719
- That's cool. - I'm already...

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.690
living a happy life as a single.

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.589
So I'm not interested at all...

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.530
in that kind of marriage.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.700
But I want to be in a marriage...

00:41:16.701 --> 00:41:17.999
(It seems they hope to gain different things through marriage.)

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.870
in which I feel happy and complete.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.670
A marriage full of love.

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.840
I do want to be in that kind of marriage.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.179
She wants to be in a marriage full of love.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.779
Not because she has to get married.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.780
I understand.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.720
I was just curious.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.790
It's a very difficult thing.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.930
Indeed. It's never easy.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.460
You should never think of it as a simple thing.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.629
But it's essential to me.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.740
I mean, gaining emotional stability.

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:02.040
(There seem subtle disagreements in their conversation.)

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.680
I wonder what the others are doing.

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.280
- She's changing the subject. - Shall we go upstairs?

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.349
It's getting late.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:13.489
Their conversation didn't last long.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.629
(Their conversation ended without a clear conclusion.)

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.600
(Meanwhile, So Hyun calms herself and faces Sang Hyeon again.)

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.630
(She gazes at Sang Hyeon quietly for a while.)

00:42:28.498 --> 00:42:31.888
(Meanwhile, So Hyun calms herself and faces Sang Hyeon again.)

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:36.072
(She gazes at Sang Hyeon quietly for a while.)

00:42:41.312 --> 00:42:42.952
About getting the wrong idea about you...

00:42:45.482 --> 00:42:46.492
I'm sorry.

00:42:50.762 --> 00:42:51.822
I'm sorry.

00:42:54.762 --> 00:42:57.001
(Staring)

00:42:57.002 --> 00:42:59.572
(Embarrassed)

00:43:01.672 --> 00:43:02.732
Well...

00:43:05.802 --> 00:43:09.882
(Sighing)

00:43:10.512 --> 00:43:11.611
So...

00:43:11.612 --> 00:43:15.652
(So Hyun tries to understand Sang Hyeon.)

00:43:17.282 --> 00:43:20.892
I'll be honest with you. You frustrate me so much.

00:43:23.322 --> 00:43:24.362
But...

00:43:25.192 --> 00:43:28.791
But the person I want to get to know better...

00:43:28.792 --> 00:43:29.902
is you, I think.

00:43:32.662 --> 00:43:34.702
- It's so frustrating. - I see.

00:43:34.802 --> 00:43:36.672
- Your dating style, I mean. - That's true.

00:43:36.802 --> 00:43:38.142
You drive me crazy.

00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:39.402
Exactly.

00:43:41.472 --> 00:43:45.412
If you just think and don't act, how can anyone know how you feel?

00:43:46.282 --> 00:43:47.282
You're right.

00:43:52.382 --> 00:43:54.051
I told her honestly.

00:43:54.052 --> 00:43:58.092
I told her what worried me.

00:43:58.592 --> 00:44:00.462
And she...

00:44:01.432 --> 00:44:04.201
was being honest with me and said I was wrong.

00:44:04.202 --> 00:44:06.571
I thought her feelings might not be genuine,

00:44:06.572 --> 00:44:09.601
which was a foolish misunderstanding...

00:44:09.602 --> 00:44:10.702
that was only in my head.

00:44:11.172 --> 00:44:13.611
He admitted he got the wrong idea.

00:44:13.612 --> 00:44:15.972
He got down on his knees and apologized to me.

00:44:19.142 --> 00:44:20.382
It was funny.

00:44:20.852 --> 00:44:24.052
Watching him act that way made me feel better.

00:44:26.522 --> 00:44:28.022
I don't even know myself anymore.

00:44:29.052 --> 00:44:32.621
Whatever happened, I was drawn to him from the get-go.

00:44:32.622 --> 00:44:33.931
(So Hyun understood Sang Hyeon and let it slide.)

00:44:33.932 --> 00:44:34.932
Right.

00:44:35.392 --> 00:44:36.932
Anyway, the misunderstanding...

00:44:37.062 --> 00:44:40.031
I'm relieved that we cleared up the misunderstanding.

00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:42.231
However we thought, the most important thing is...

00:44:42.232 --> 00:44:44.671
that we cleared up the misunderstanding.

00:44:44.672 --> 00:44:46.792
(Sang Hyeon misunderstood So Hyun's honest feelings.)

00:44:47.212 --> 00:44:49.658
Sang Hyeon is already the type that overthinks about everything.

00:44:49.682 --> 00:44:52.212
And in various situations,

00:44:52.582 --> 00:44:54.252
he couldn't do anything for her...

00:44:54.352 --> 00:44:56.722
or make the right judgment. Watching himself like that,

00:44:56.822 --> 00:44:58.542
he must've thought of him as really uncool.

00:44:59.022 --> 00:45:01.621
To be perfectly honest, he frustrates me as well.

00:45:01.622 --> 00:45:04.091
Because he overthinks, it takes him time to take actions,

00:45:04.092 --> 00:45:05.461
- and he feels bad about it. - Right.

00:45:05.462 --> 00:45:08.131
- And that repeated several times, - Exactly.

00:45:08.132 --> 00:45:09.461
Which caused miscommunication between him and So Hyun.

00:45:09.462 --> 00:45:13.301
But fortunately, So Hyun, as someone older than him, cleared his doubt.

00:45:13.302 --> 00:45:14.302
That's right.

00:45:14.303 --> 00:45:16.303
(Fortunately, So Hyun cleared Sang Hyeon's doubt.)

00:45:16.972 --> 00:45:19.372
(The long night has passed, and a new day begins.)

00:45:19.972 --> 00:45:24.012
(The morning has come after the age reveal.)

00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:25.781
(Bon Hee and So Hyun's room)

00:45:25.782 --> 00:45:27.381
They're too young, right?

00:45:27.382 --> 00:45:28.412
Right.

00:45:28.612 --> 00:45:30.751
- I couldn't even imagine that. - True.

00:45:30.752 --> 00:45:32.121
I'm really conservative.

00:45:32.122 --> 00:45:33.752
- Oh, you are? - Yes.

00:45:33.852 --> 00:45:35.752
He really is too young.

00:45:35.852 --> 00:45:37.021
How much younger is he than you?

00:45:37.022 --> 00:45:38.292
He's 12 years younger than me.

00:45:38.492 --> 00:45:41.031
I had a lot going on in my mind...

00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:43.562
whereas he seemed so purehearted acting as if it was nothing.

00:45:43.662 --> 00:45:46.061
He nonchalantly said things like, "Let's go there together later."

00:45:46.062 --> 00:45:48.031
I mean, he must've worried about the age difference.

00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:49.671
- But he still showed his feelings. - Right.

00:45:49.672 --> 00:45:51.672
And the way he reacted...

00:45:52.242 --> 00:45:54.341
- makes me forget about everything. - It stops you from it?

00:45:54.342 --> 00:45:56.211
So I go along with him without worrying...

00:45:56.212 --> 00:45:57.341
and express my feelings.

00:45:57.342 --> 00:45:59.182
I see. That makes sense.

00:46:00.252 --> 00:46:02.811
Yesterday, he touched me so deeply...

00:46:02.812 --> 00:46:04.358
by giving me the peach and the eye drop.

00:46:04.382 --> 00:46:05.382
- Eye drop? - Yes.

00:46:05.682 --> 00:46:07.728
- I don't know about that. - After talking to Sang Hyeon,

00:46:07.752 --> 00:46:10.621
we came down to the second floor, and Ji Yung saw us.

00:46:10.622 --> 00:46:12.392
I kept pressing my eyes like this.

00:46:12.492 --> 00:46:15.332
Then Ji Yung came to give me three containers of eye drop.

00:46:15.532 --> 00:46:17.102
Oh, really?

00:46:18.162 --> 00:46:21.332
(So Hyun's eyes were dry all day long yesterday.)

00:46:22.602 --> 00:46:25.201
(Ji Yung heard about that and got eye drops for her.)

00:46:25.202 --> 00:46:27.011
Eye drop? Oh, you got those for her.

00:46:27.012 --> 00:46:28.411
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

00:46:28.412 --> 00:46:29.982
He gave her eye drops.

00:46:30.082 --> 00:46:31.341
- Really? Thank you. - How sweet.

00:46:31.342 --> 00:46:32.681
That's so thoughtful of him.

00:46:32.682 --> 00:46:33.951
(Regardless of whether or not she reciprocates, Ji Yung helps her.)

00:46:33.952 --> 00:46:34.982
He's very thoughtful.

00:46:35.752 --> 00:46:36.922
That cute brat.

00:46:38.322 --> 00:46:39.652
"That cute brat?"

00:46:39.752 --> 00:46:41.421
Isn't he a cute brat?

00:46:41.422 --> 00:46:43.461
- He's the youngest of all. - Exactly.

00:46:43.462 --> 00:46:45.722
He really does everything...

00:46:46.362 --> 00:46:48.092
that the woman he likes wants.

00:46:48.732 --> 00:46:50.162
He's really proactive.

00:46:50.802 --> 00:46:52.331
I bet he is. He's manly.

00:46:52.332 --> 00:46:53.771
- He's confident. - Indeed.

00:46:53.772 --> 00:46:55.572
- I like that about him. - Right.

00:46:57.072 --> 00:46:58.771
Things like that touch a woman's heart.

00:46:58.772 --> 00:46:59.772
- That's right. - Right.

00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:00.818
(Ji Yung clearly expresses his feelings to the end.)

00:47:00.842 --> 00:47:02.441
Suddenly, Ji Yung won the ladies' hearts?

00:47:02.442 --> 00:47:04.511
Exactly. With three containers of eye drop.

00:47:04.512 --> 00:47:06.793
(Ji Yung suddenly wins the affection of the older women?)

00:47:07.712 --> 00:47:11.552
(Mu Jin is sprucing himself up alone in his room.)

00:47:13.252 --> 00:47:17.222
(Right then, a message arrives.)

00:47:17.592 --> 00:47:20.462
(Today, you will have Day and Night Dates.)

00:47:20.832 --> 00:47:22.831
(Please pick one lady for a daytime chat...)

00:47:22.832 --> 00:47:24.861
(and one for a nighttime chat.)

00:47:24.862 --> 00:47:26.132
This is the end.

00:47:26.232 --> 00:47:28.502
What if more than one man choose the same woman?

00:47:28.602 --> 00:47:30.671
- The date will end more shortly. - Will they meet all together?

00:47:30.672 --> 00:47:33.272
(The younger men choose their dates for their last dates.)

00:47:33.512 --> 00:47:36.141
The younger men will choose one woman...

00:47:36.142 --> 00:47:38.381
to go on a date with in the daytime and the nighttime each.

00:47:38.382 --> 00:47:41.012
I'm sure some of the ladies will be chosen by more than one man.

00:47:41.412 --> 00:47:43.782
And it's the last date before the final decision.

00:47:43.882 --> 00:47:46.552
So they will choose the women very carefully.

00:47:46.652 --> 00:47:48.052
Probably.

00:47:49.452 --> 00:47:50.992
(Sighing)

00:47:53.532 --> 00:47:55.092
- Did you all get the message? - Yes.

00:47:56.962 --> 00:47:59.562
What if I choose the same person for both the day and night?

00:47:59.662 --> 00:48:01.972
No way. You should choose one for each.

00:48:02.072 --> 00:48:04.472
I'm most curious about Mu Jin and Hyeon Jun.

00:48:04.672 --> 00:48:07.241
What did you talk about with them, and how deep was the conversation?

00:48:07.242 --> 00:48:10.842
The two of you have been close to them for quite a long time.

00:48:11.142 --> 00:48:13.351
So you must've had progress in your conversations with them.

00:48:13.352 --> 00:48:15.282
I'll go first.

00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:18.081
Rather than asking about her dating style...

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:21.592
and the type of men she likes,

00:48:22.022 --> 00:48:23.922
I tried...

00:48:25.062 --> 00:48:27.261
to hear her life story.

00:48:27.262 --> 00:48:28.362
That's mature.

00:48:28.892 --> 00:48:30.801
Is Mu Jin giving them a lecture?

00:48:30.802 --> 00:48:32.361
(Kim Mu Jin, the star instructor of dating?)

00:48:32.362 --> 00:48:33.572
The star instructor of dating?

00:48:36.302 --> 00:48:37.972
Goodness. It's hard to decide.

00:48:39.812 --> 00:48:41.872
(Sighing)

00:48:43.412 --> 00:48:46.012
Since it's the day before the final decision,

00:48:46.882 --> 00:48:50.782
I think it'll be more romantic if we talk at night...

00:48:51.282 --> 00:48:55.452
and that we'll be able to have a more honest conversation.

00:48:57.922 --> 00:49:02.062
Those were the last dates before the final decision,

00:49:02.432 --> 00:49:04.108
and I didn't have a lot of time to spend with the women.

00:49:04.132 --> 00:49:05.838
So I decided to choose one that I wanted to talk to...

00:49:05.862 --> 00:49:08.932
and one that I wanted to have a deeper conversation with.

00:49:09.432 --> 00:49:11.342
With that thought, I chose two women.

00:49:13.072 --> 00:49:14.112
Who could they be?

00:49:15.172 --> 00:49:16.612
I clearly knew whom I should choose.

00:49:17.112 --> 00:49:20.382
The ones I want to get to know better.

00:49:24.122 --> 00:49:25.651
The ones he wants to get to know "better."

00:49:25.652 --> 00:49:28.351
(They choose their dates more carefully than ever.)

00:49:28.352 --> 00:49:31.391
They will have dates in the daytime...

00:49:31.392 --> 00:49:33.462
- and in the nighttime separately. - Yes.

00:49:33.562 --> 00:49:36.291
These will be their last dates on this show.

00:49:36.292 --> 00:49:39.972
What's the difference between a day date and a night date?

00:49:40.202 --> 00:49:42.483
If you want to talk honestly with someone over a drink...

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:46.371
and get to know her deeper, you should pick a night date.

00:49:46.372 --> 00:49:47.411
Right.

00:49:47.412 --> 00:49:49.312
Yes. And for a day date,

00:49:49.672 --> 00:49:52.192
you wouldn't choose someone you want to spend more time with...

00:49:52.382 --> 00:49:54.752
so that you can get to know her better.

00:49:54.852 --> 00:49:57.292
I don't think they'd choose someone like that for a day date.

00:49:57.682 --> 00:49:58.982
I agree with him.

00:49:59.282 --> 00:50:01.251
They have to choose two women.

00:50:01.252 --> 00:50:04.321
So there must be the best and the second best.

00:50:04.322 --> 00:50:05.861
Of course, there will be the 1st and 2nd choices.

00:50:05.862 --> 00:50:09.191
Right? I bet they'll definitely pick the first choice for a night date...

00:50:09.192 --> 00:50:10.431
- Really? - Yes.

00:50:10.432 --> 00:50:13.302
Because the night date will be the last date they will have.

00:50:13.632 --> 00:50:15.731
And the day date could fade into memory...

00:50:15.732 --> 00:50:17.571
- as time passes, as Woo Young said. - Oh, I get it.

00:50:17.572 --> 00:50:20.171
The day date could be forgotten?

00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:22.472
Yes, I think so. I'd forget about the day date.

00:50:23.142 --> 00:50:24.611
- A night date is better. - Do you prefer a night date?

00:50:24.612 --> 00:50:25.612
Yes, a night date is better.

00:50:25.613 --> 00:50:27.581
It's easier to have an honest conversation at night.

00:50:27.582 --> 00:50:28.582
That's right.

00:50:29.512 --> 00:50:32.721
(Older women, please check your dates in the QR Room.)

00:50:32.722 --> 00:50:34.322
These are the last dates they will have.

00:50:36.922 --> 00:50:38.691
Oh, she's here.

00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:41.062
(The first older woman, Bon Hee)

00:50:42.462 --> 00:50:45.501
(Whom will she have the Day and Night Dates with?)

00:50:45.502 --> 00:50:47.901
She'll find out who asked her out on a date.

00:50:47.902 --> 00:50:49.672
(Surprised)

00:50:50.442 --> 00:50:51.442
Who could it be?

00:50:52.002 --> 00:50:53.571
I'm sure Mu Jin chose her.

00:50:53.572 --> 00:50:56.112
- Right. - There's no doubt Mu Jin chose her.

00:50:58.312 --> 00:51:00.081
Well... Yeong Gyeong...

00:51:00.082 --> 00:51:02.151
- Hyeon Jun. - I hope someone chose her.

00:51:02.152 --> 00:51:03.152
Right.

00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:06.822
(Who will go on a date with So Hyun, the third older woman?)

00:51:06.922 --> 00:51:08.492
Since we have only one day left,

00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:12.592
I wanted to have a more serious talk with Sang Hyeon.

00:51:14.462 --> 00:51:16.092
- Her reaction... - Why?

00:51:17.002 --> 00:51:18.302
What's going on? Why?

00:51:18.462 --> 00:51:20.072
Isn't it because he didn't choose her?

00:51:20.702 --> 00:51:22.708
Is it because she wasn't chosen by the one she expected?

00:51:22.732 --> 00:51:24.871
Or was she chosen by someone she never expected?

00:51:24.872 --> 00:51:26.342
She doesn't look so happy.

00:51:28.642 --> 00:51:33.182
(The fourth older woman, Ji Won)

00:51:33.882 --> 00:51:36.482
I'm interested in Sang Won,

00:51:36.952 --> 00:51:39.322
but we have little time left.

00:51:40.022 --> 00:51:42.722
- What? - What? That's a similar reaction.

00:51:45.562 --> 00:51:49.091
(And the last one, Ye Eun)

00:51:49.092 --> 00:51:53.162
I want to go on a date with Sang Won.

00:51:53.532 --> 00:51:56.101
All she thinks about is Sang Won.

00:51:56.102 --> 00:51:58.742
(Could Ye Eun meet Sang Won on the Day and Night Dates?)

00:52:01.272 --> 00:52:02.272
- What? - Why?

00:52:02.273 --> 00:52:03.941
- What on earth is going on? - What happened?

00:52:03.942 --> 00:52:05.841
- What is going on right now? - Why did she react that way?

00:52:05.842 --> 00:52:07.411
All three of them...

00:52:07.412 --> 00:52:08.981
- They didn't seem happy... Right. - seemed dumbfounded.

00:52:08.982 --> 00:52:10.921
- They didn't seem so happy. - Exactly.

00:52:10.922 --> 00:52:12.822
- They all seemed flabbergasted. - Right.

00:52:17.992 --> 00:52:19.692
(Hissing)

00:52:22.632 --> 00:52:24.761
(Ye Eun goes under the blanket as soon as she comes to her room.)

00:52:24.762 --> 00:52:26.931
Going under the blanket probably means she is upset.

00:52:26.932 --> 00:52:29.271
Is it because she's very excited?

00:52:29.272 --> 00:52:30.971
- I don't think that's the case. - I don't think so.

00:52:30.972 --> 00:52:35.141
(Quietly, she covers her face with the blanket.)

00:52:35.142 --> 00:52:36.211
(Sniffling)

00:52:36.212 --> 00:52:37.342
Is she crying?

00:52:38.912 --> 00:52:40.882
- Oh, no. - Poor her.

00:52:43.282 --> 00:52:44.522
Are you okay?

00:52:46.852 --> 00:52:50.991
(Ye Eun wasn't chosen by anyone today.)

00:52:50.992 --> 00:52:52.362
My gosh. Really?

00:52:56.692 --> 00:52:58.332
I see that I'm not popular.

00:52:58.432 --> 00:53:01.532
That's not true. Don't think that way.

00:53:02.472 --> 00:53:05.172
This is practically the last day at Yeon House.

00:53:05.902 --> 00:53:07.842
Of course, she wants to cry.

00:53:09.442 --> 00:53:12.311
I wonder whom Sang Won chose.

00:53:12.312 --> 00:53:13.341
Exactly.

00:53:13.342 --> 00:53:15.952
The fact that she was chosen by no one...

00:53:16.452 --> 00:53:18.852
means that someone was chosen by many men.

00:53:20.922 --> 00:53:22.922
(The younger men chose their own dates.)

00:53:24.022 --> 00:53:28.232
(It's time to meet the older women they want to go on dates with.)

00:53:30.132 --> 00:53:32.201
(Waiting for his date for the day date, Sang Hyeon looks nervous.)

00:53:32.202 --> 00:53:33.302
Sang Hyeon...

00:53:34.172 --> 00:53:36.032
Sang Hyeon made a choice.

00:53:39.572 --> 00:53:41.742
If So Hyun doesn't come...

00:53:41.842 --> 00:53:43.612
Won't he meet So Hyun at night?

00:53:43.882 --> 00:53:46.141
- Oh, because this is a day date? - Yes. It's a day date.

00:53:46.142 --> 00:53:48.582
(Who's Sang Hyeon's date for the day date?)

00:53:51.052 --> 00:53:54.151
(While Sang Hyeon is waiting, )

00:53:54.152 --> 00:53:56.822
(an older woman is approaching him.)

00:53:57.322 --> 00:54:00.131
(Sang Hyeon's date for the day date)

00:54:00.132 --> 00:54:01.161
(Bon Hee)

00:54:01.162 --> 00:54:03.092
- Oh, it's Bon Hee. - It's Bon Hee.

00:54:03.562 --> 00:54:04.631
She looks pretty.

00:54:04.632 --> 00:54:06.062
(Smiling)

00:54:07.372 --> 00:54:09.602
Oh, my goodness.

00:54:09.802 --> 00:54:11.371
So he picked her in the end.

00:54:11.372 --> 00:54:14.512
For the day date, I chose Bon Hee whom I'd never gone on a date with.

00:54:15.342 --> 00:54:18.742
Even though I know she has a good relationship with Mu Jin,

00:54:19.142 --> 00:54:20.382
aside from that,

00:54:20.882 --> 00:54:22.382
I wanted to talk more to her.

00:54:22.982 --> 00:54:25.381
- He should leave no regrets. - Whom did you choose?

00:54:25.382 --> 00:54:26.382
(Five-Minute Time Attack Date, "Did you choose Bon Hee?")

00:54:26.383 --> 00:54:28.392
(I chose Bon Hee.)

00:54:28.922 --> 00:54:32.192
(He hesitated and missed his chance to go on the first date with her.)

00:54:32.962 --> 00:54:36.862
(Who else do you want to talk to?)

00:54:37.702 --> 00:54:39.362
(Bon Hee...)

00:54:39.462 --> 00:54:42.202
(From the beginning, Sang Hyeon always wanted to talk to Bon Hee.)

00:54:42.802 --> 00:54:44.972
(On the second night, he went to see Bon Hee.)

00:54:46.972 --> 00:54:50.682
(I wanted to go on a date with you too, Bon Hee.)

00:54:50.942 --> 00:54:52.711
(From the start, Sang Hyeon has been sending Love QR messages to her.)

00:54:52.712 --> 00:54:54.951
Watching their story somehow makes me...

00:54:54.952 --> 00:54:58.152
feel like I'm watching a music video.

00:54:58.652 --> 00:54:59.852
It's too sad.

00:55:01.022 --> 00:55:05.021
(Sang Hyeon has been wanting to go on a date with Bon Hee.)

00:55:05.022 --> 00:55:06.492
She must be so beautiful.

00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:08.861
- He must be thrilled. - He's thrilled.

00:55:08.862 --> 00:55:10.832
(Flinching)

00:55:11.232 --> 00:55:12.362
Stay there.

00:55:13.402 --> 00:55:14.402
I'll come to you.

00:55:14.403 --> 00:55:16.232
(I'll come to you.)

00:55:17.002 --> 00:55:20.541
I wanted to get a chance to talk to Sang Hyeon...

00:55:20.542 --> 00:55:22.612
at least once.

00:55:23.312 --> 00:55:26.141
Fortunately, just before it ended,

00:55:26.142 --> 00:55:29.982
we got a chance to talk, and I was relieved.

00:55:31.282 --> 00:55:36.692
(Finally, Sang Hyeon and Bon Hee are on a date.)

00:55:38.922 --> 00:55:40.392
- When you were walking in... - Yes?

00:55:41.732 --> 00:55:44.001
Wait, can I just call you by your name, Bon Hee?

00:55:44.002 --> 00:55:45.062
Sure.

00:55:46.232 --> 00:55:48.132
- You should do the same. - Just like that?

00:55:48.472 --> 00:55:50.701
I was already speaking quite casually to you.

00:55:50.702 --> 00:55:52.641
- Right. - I am speaking casually.

00:55:52.642 --> 00:55:55.841
I thought I was always speaking formally. Wasn't I?

00:55:55.842 --> 00:55:58.442
The other day, we said we should all speak casually now.

00:55:58.812 --> 00:56:00.182
- Right. - Let's speak casually.

00:56:02.052 --> 00:56:03.381
I don't think so, Sang Hyeon.

00:56:03.382 --> 00:56:05.382
Can I? May I speak casually to you now?

00:56:06.782 --> 00:56:09.752
- It takes time for me. - Does it take time?

00:56:10.522 --> 00:56:13.122
- I haven't done it to anyone yet. - You haven't?

00:56:13.422 --> 00:56:14.691
How about Mu Jin?

00:56:14.692 --> 00:56:15.891
I only did it because it was a mission.

00:56:15.892 --> 00:56:18.862
I spoke formally to him after. That's where I am at.

00:56:19.362 --> 00:56:21.502
Can I speak casually to you though?

00:56:23.072 --> 00:56:24.572
I will speak casually.

00:56:25.572 --> 00:56:26.642
Okay.

00:56:27.372 --> 00:56:28.572
As you were walking here...

00:56:30.172 --> 00:56:32.512
Although you are not wearing a dress,

00:56:33.112 --> 00:56:35.652
you looked like you were walking down the aisle.

00:56:35.912 --> 00:56:38.252
And it felt strange.

00:56:38.952 --> 00:56:40.922
You were beautiful.

00:56:42.192 --> 00:56:44.722
(Shy)

00:56:47.162 --> 00:56:49.292
Seeing you like this, you are quite different.

00:56:49.462 --> 00:56:51.802
I was determined to go on a proper date with you once.

00:56:52.102 --> 00:56:53.332
Right.

00:56:54.632 --> 00:56:56.832
Right. I wanted to talk to you in private too.

00:56:58.172 --> 00:57:00.441
You felt like someone...

00:57:00.442 --> 00:57:03.541
who would...

00:57:03.542 --> 00:57:05.582
understand and accept...

00:57:06.182 --> 00:57:09.011
even the ugly parts of me.

00:57:09.012 --> 00:57:10.212
Bon Hee felt like that person?

00:57:13.452 --> 00:57:15.492
We're going home the day after tomorrow.

00:57:15.852 --> 00:57:18.491
- So I wanted to talk to you. - I see.

00:57:18.492 --> 00:57:20.862
I thought I had to talk to you today.

00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:22.832
It's funny,

00:57:23.292 --> 00:57:25.262
but as soon as I received the mission,

00:57:26.162 --> 00:57:29.601
I declared that I would go on a day date with you.

00:57:29.602 --> 00:57:30.902
He did well.

00:57:31.142 --> 00:57:33.201
(Please pick one lady for a daytime chat...)

00:57:33.202 --> 00:57:35.341
(and one for a nighttime chat.)

00:57:35.342 --> 00:57:37.112
I want to talk to Bon Hee in the daytime.

00:57:38.382 --> 00:57:39.612
Are you declaring war?

00:57:39.812 --> 00:57:41.052
(Is Sang Hyeon declaring war?)

00:57:41.512 --> 00:57:43.552
By the way, are you supposed to say who you choose?

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.551
If it's one for daytime and one for night,

00:57:45.552 --> 00:57:47.221
we can talk to the person we want.

00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:48.621
We don't need to say it aloud.

00:57:48.622 --> 00:57:49.652
Right.

00:57:50.692 --> 00:57:51.821
He got a little annoyed.

00:57:51.822 --> 00:57:52.991
- Yes. - Yes.

00:57:52.992 --> 00:57:54.262
He's annoyed.

00:57:54.962 --> 00:57:56.961
You said it in front of everyone?

00:57:56.962 --> 00:57:59.131
Yes, when guys were all gathered.

00:57:59.132 --> 00:58:00.732
I said I'd talk to you in the daytime.

00:58:01.972 --> 00:58:03.072
That's nice.

00:58:04.042 --> 00:58:06.172
That's why we are able to have a chat like this.

00:58:08.672 --> 00:58:11.512
- Oh, dear. - I'm glad he mustered his courage.

00:58:12.182 --> 00:58:14.252
It's better than having regrets.

00:58:14.612 --> 00:58:17.012
I love the color green.

00:58:17.382 --> 00:58:19.722
- You do? - It suits you so well.

00:58:20.122 --> 00:58:23.722
- It does. - I love green.

00:58:24.762 --> 00:58:27.632
I love green shades and brown and green combination.

00:58:27.992 --> 00:58:30.031
They are relaxing colors.

00:58:30.032 --> 00:58:32.002
- Right. - They make you calm.

00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:37.202
- Are you wearing lenses? - No, I am not.

00:58:38.302 --> 00:58:40.571
Your eyes are really brown.

00:58:40.572 --> 00:58:42.642
Yes. My eyes are brown.

00:58:43.142 --> 00:58:44.381
They suit you so well.

00:58:44.382 --> 00:58:45.981
I thought you were wearing contact lenses.

00:58:45.982 --> 00:58:48.211
(You did?)

00:58:48.212 --> 00:58:50.821
Oh, dear. He's so happy.

00:58:50.822 --> 00:58:52.852
- My eyes are slightly brown too. - Can I see?

00:58:53.322 --> 00:58:54.551
I will check later.

00:58:54.552 --> 00:58:55.992
- Check later. - I will check later.

00:58:59.192 --> 00:59:01.662
After coming to Yeon House,

00:59:02.692 --> 00:59:05.362
I regretted,

00:59:07.202 --> 00:59:09.531
and I spent time alone,

00:59:09.532 --> 00:59:12.172
lost in my thoughts.

00:59:13.242 --> 00:59:15.071
It might be the age difference.

00:59:15.072 --> 00:59:16.312
It might have been the issue...

00:59:17.142 --> 00:59:19.582
with my self-esteem.

00:59:20.012 --> 00:59:21.812
Because of those things,

00:59:22.382 --> 00:59:25.022
the more I thought about things, the more embarrassed I got.

00:59:25.682 --> 00:59:28.352
I am embarrassed of myself a little.

00:59:29.422 --> 00:59:31.302
Those thoughts have been haunting me all along.

00:59:31.762 --> 00:59:35.762
But when I talked to you,

00:59:37.432 --> 00:59:39.602
you told me you did the same...

00:59:40.532 --> 00:59:44.142
and that you managed to overcome it naturally.

00:59:45.902 --> 00:59:50.441
You told me that it wasn't weird at all.

00:59:50.442 --> 00:59:51.681
(Bon Hee comforted Sang Hyeon.)

00:59:51.682 --> 00:59:52.781
Did she?

00:59:52.782 --> 00:59:54.451
I loved your warmth.

00:59:54.452 --> 00:59:57.481
(Sang Hyeon loved Bon Hee's warmth.)

00:59:57.482 --> 00:59:58.751
I loved your warmth.

00:59:58.752 --> 01:00:00.821
So this is what Sang Hyeon likes.

01:00:00.822 --> 01:00:03.691
He seems to feel comfortable when he's around someone alike.

01:00:03.692 --> 01:00:05.522
You and Mu Jin.

01:00:06.962 --> 01:00:08.531
Have you been interested in each other...

01:00:08.532 --> 01:00:11.532
since the first time you met?

01:00:12.332 --> 01:00:13.702
It wasn't like that.

01:00:14.472 --> 01:00:16.031
On the day we arrived, I just learned...

01:00:16.032 --> 01:00:17.502
- I see. - about who were here.

01:00:17.942 --> 01:00:19.441
I thought everyone was nice.

01:00:19.442 --> 01:00:21.942
That was the first day emotion.

01:00:23.242 --> 01:00:24.781
He seemed like a nice person.

01:00:24.782 --> 01:00:27.652
That was my thought on the first day.

01:00:29.182 --> 01:00:32.251
I wonder how things would have unfolded...

01:00:32.252 --> 01:00:35.422
if you went on that first date with me.

01:00:35.592 --> 01:00:36.791
- Right. - Oh, dear.

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:39.292
We never know what would've happened then.

01:00:40.592 --> 01:00:42.891
If I got to know you first,

01:00:42.892 --> 01:00:44.462
realized how good of a match we are,

01:00:45.932 --> 01:00:48.301
and then chose a date...

01:00:48.302 --> 01:00:50.742
on a first-come-first-served basis,

01:00:52.672 --> 01:00:56.172
perhaps then I would have made bolder moves.

01:00:56.472 --> 01:00:59.481
- At the time, I was careful. - He's regretting...

01:00:59.482 --> 01:01:00.881
- every single move he made. - Right.

01:01:00.882 --> 01:01:02.182
He's saying everything he can.

01:01:02.782 --> 01:01:06.251
This is my personal opinion, but I think he is regretting...

01:01:06.252 --> 01:01:08.021
the fact that he hesitated...

01:01:08.022 --> 01:01:11.292
to express his feelings for her...

01:01:11.692 --> 01:01:14.131
while Mu Jin was making bold moves.

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:18.302
He lost his chance to Mu Jin.

01:01:18.662 --> 01:01:23.202
But Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon...

01:01:23.672 --> 01:01:26.041
met just 2 to 3 hours after that.

01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.942
Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon are just two 2 to 3 hours apart.

01:01:29.412 --> 01:01:31.341
But if he expressed his interest in her...

01:01:31.342 --> 01:01:34.051
and approached her from the beginning,

01:01:34.052 --> 01:01:36.851
they would have started...

01:01:36.852 --> 01:01:38.421
- from the same starting line. - Right.

01:01:38.422 --> 01:01:40.852
At this point, he might regret that.

01:01:45.192 --> 01:01:47.432
By the way, Mu Jin was great yesterday.

01:01:47.562 --> 01:01:49.931
Whether we are talking among ourselves...

01:01:49.932 --> 01:01:53.632
or we are talking to the camera after the announcement,

01:01:54.472 --> 01:01:58.572
he didn't regret the choices he made.

01:01:59.402 --> 01:02:02.411
He didn't regret at all. I could see that he didn't...

01:02:02.412 --> 01:02:04.842
mind the age difference at all.

01:02:05.812 --> 01:02:07.011
I thought he was great.

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:08.851
He's praising Mu Jin too.

01:02:08.852 --> 01:02:10.111
Right. He's amazing.

01:02:10.112 --> 01:02:11.481
- That's amazing. - I wouldn't have been...

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:13.252
able to do what he did.

01:02:14.192 --> 01:02:15.851
What I want to tell you...

01:02:15.852 --> 01:02:18.592
is that I used to be someone very similar to you.

01:02:18.962 --> 01:02:20.391
But who I am today is...

01:02:20.392 --> 01:02:22.932
very different from who I was ten years ago.

01:02:23.362 --> 01:02:24.832
I was introverted.

01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:26.502
You remind me of myself.

01:02:26.932 --> 01:02:28.532
I can understand you perfectly.

01:02:29.972 --> 01:02:33.171
You have your own strengths and weaknesses.

01:02:33.172 --> 01:02:35.711
I saw how thoughtful you are in different ways.

01:02:35.712 --> 01:02:37.141
Right. He's thoughtful.

01:02:37.142 --> 01:02:38.311
It's just different.

01:02:38.312 --> 01:02:41.212
Finding the person who matches your frequency is what matters.

01:02:41.452 --> 01:02:43.451
Just because someone expresses everything he feels...

01:02:43.452 --> 01:02:46.151
doesn't mean that's cool.

01:02:46.152 --> 01:02:47.182
Right.

01:02:47.522 --> 01:02:48.892
I will say something funny.

01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:52.622
Someone loves it when a guy hands her a flower...

01:02:52.892 --> 01:02:55.561
in front of a big crowd.

01:02:55.562 --> 01:02:57.291
- Right. - But there's also someone...

01:02:57.292 --> 01:02:59.532
- who cringes in that situation. - You get paralyzed.

01:02:59.802 --> 01:03:00.931
She hates it when a guy...

01:03:00.932 --> 01:03:02.871
confesses his love in front of so many people.

01:03:02.872 --> 01:03:04.242
At the end of the day,

01:03:05.402 --> 01:03:06.501
it's all personal preference.

01:03:06.502 --> 01:03:08.341
So I don't see you as being...

01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:10.112
less cool than Mu Jin.

01:03:10.242 --> 01:03:12.212
- Then... - I see the things unique to you.

01:03:12.712 --> 01:03:14.381
At times like this,

01:03:14.382 --> 01:03:16.211
she's got that "older woman power,"

01:03:16.212 --> 01:03:17.481
- if I may call it that. - That's right.

01:03:17.482 --> 01:03:21.291
She's got that charm of an older woman.

01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:22.651
- Right. - I know.

01:03:22.652 --> 01:03:24.022
I...

01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:26.662
Isn't she so great?

01:03:27.632 --> 01:03:29.491
- I... - Are you in love with her?

01:03:29.492 --> 01:03:30.492
I am.

01:03:31.432 --> 01:03:34.901
Sang Hyeon seems to be...

01:03:34.902 --> 01:03:38.142
regretful and self-sabotaging.

01:03:38.672 --> 01:03:41.311
- She perfectly... - Comforted him?

01:03:41.312 --> 01:03:42.871
- Yes. She... - She understood him.

01:03:42.872 --> 01:03:46.142
She's embracing him in the most perfect manner,

01:03:46.642 --> 01:03:48.982
and that makes her really cool.

01:03:50.482 --> 01:03:53.251
Whenever someone asked about my ideal type...

01:03:53.252 --> 01:03:54.892
in terms of character, rather than looks,

01:03:55.822 --> 01:03:59.161
I always said it was someone who doesn't make me feel small.

01:03:59.162 --> 01:04:00.222
Right.

01:04:01.032 --> 01:04:03.231
Then people asked, "What makes you feel small?"

01:04:03.232 --> 01:04:06.432
I always struggled to answer.

01:04:06.602 --> 01:04:09.072
Someone who doesn't get irritated much.

01:04:09.732 --> 01:04:13.302
Someone who is considerate of me. Those were my answers.

01:04:13.742 --> 01:04:16.112
(Nodding)

01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:22.382
Seeing you, I know now.

01:04:22.852 --> 01:04:25.852
I know the kind of love that doesn't make me feel small.

01:04:26.852 --> 01:04:27.951
Oh, dear.

01:04:27.952 --> 01:04:30.521
Someone who doesn't get frustrated by me being this way,

01:04:30.522 --> 01:04:32.862
someone who's willing to wait for me and accept me.

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.362
I can now say that.

01:04:36.692 --> 01:04:38.932
I feel like he's constantly confessing his love for her.

01:04:39.202 --> 01:04:41.671
Bon Hee's heart must break...

01:04:41.672 --> 01:04:43.602
listening to that.

01:04:44.202 --> 01:04:46.572
Anyway, tomorrow,

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:51.281
we will have to make a decision.

01:04:51.282 --> 01:04:53.162
(They don't have much time left in Yeon House.)

01:04:53.212 --> 01:04:54.882
Whatever I choose,

01:04:59.582 --> 01:05:03.722
I will follow my heart, as you taught me.

01:05:04.622 --> 01:05:05.992
That's packed with meaning.

01:05:08.432 --> 01:05:10.061
He's confessing his love until the very end.

01:05:10.062 --> 01:05:14.872
(Where will Sang Hyeon's heart end up?)

01:05:15.902 --> 01:05:16.932
Should we...

01:05:19.302 --> 01:05:21.072
- take a walk? - Shall we?

01:05:22.442 --> 01:05:23.512
Sounds great.

01:05:34.322 --> 01:05:35.451
You are so eloquent.

01:05:35.452 --> 01:05:37.592
- No, I'm not. - You are eloquent.

01:05:37.762 --> 01:05:39.192
I nearly fell for you.

01:05:40.222 --> 01:05:41.991
- Seriously. - I feel...

01:05:41.992 --> 01:05:44.601
a little more comfortable with you now.

01:05:44.602 --> 01:05:46.702
- It was something I wanted to say. - Be careful.

01:05:49.002 --> 01:05:50.032
And...

01:05:50.772 --> 01:05:52.502
What's your ideal type? Be honest.

01:05:53.342 --> 01:05:54.942
- Me? - Be brutally honest.

01:05:55.472 --> 01:05:56.542
I like someone...

01:05:57.742 --> 01:06:00.641
who's got a nice voice. That's...

01:06:00.642 --> 01:06:02.312
- How's my voice? - It's nice.

01:06:02.952 --> 01:06:04.082
I will tell you that.

01:06:04.522 --> 01:06:06.221
I can tell you right away if something is good.

01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:07.222
Lucky me.

01:06:07.282 --> 01:06:09.752
The date with Bon Hee...

01:06:10.752 --> 01:06:13.162
left a very strong impression.

01:06:13.522 --> 01:06:14.892
That made me...

01:06:16.892 --> 01:06:20.061
very indecisive.

01:06:20.062 --> 01:06:21.171
What will he do?

01:06:21.172 --> 01:06:25.102
It made me regret that we didn't go on a date sooner.

01:06:25.802 --> 01:06:29.572
I felt really sorry that it was our first date.

01:06:30.742 --> 01:06:34.852
I realized my ideal type of woman...

01:06:34.882 --> 01:06:36.052
was actually Bon Hee.

01:06:37.112 --> 01:06:39.452
That made me really confused.

01:06:40.082 --> 01:06:41.852
- Oh, dear. - He's in big trouble.

01:06:41.892 --> 01:06:42.892
What will he do?

01:06:43.922 --> 01:06:46.122
- What will he do? - What will he do now?

01:06:46.792 --> 01:06:50.591
Looking at their date, this is what I thought.

01:06:50.592 --> 01:06:53.261
I thought Sang Hyeon went on the date...

01:06:53.262 --> 01:06:55.301
to end things with Bon Hee.

01:06:55.302 --> 01:06:56.978
But when he was leaving, he seems to have realized,

01:06:57.002 --> 01:06:58.502
"It's true that I like her."

01:06:59.172 --> 01:07:00.871
"I'm in trouble."

01:07:00.872 --> 01:07:02.192
Sang Hyeon came to a realization.

01:07:02.312 --> 01:07:03.832
I think he fell more in love with her.

01:07:03.872 --> 01:07:06.241
How will these late 1-on-1 dates...

01:07:06.242 --> 01:07:08.812
affect their final decision?

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:12.282
I think Sang Hyeon will choose Bon Hee until the end.

01:07:12.822 --> 01:07:15.651
We will have to see how the night date...

01:07:15.652 --> 01:07:17.452
- with So Hyun goes. - Listen.

01:07:17.692 --> 01:07:20.962
We don't know if Sang Hyeon chose So Hyun.

01:07:21.162 --> 01:07:23.592
You're right. Why did we think he already chose her?

01:07:23.992 --> 01:07:25.402
- Right. - We don't know.

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:26.962
But don't you think...

01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:29.472
the night date wouldn't matter at all?

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:31.972
- The night date won't matter? - Right.

01:07:32.142 --> 01:07:33.501
The night date won't have any impact?

01:07:33.502 --> 01:07:35.111
That's what I think.

01:07:35.112 --> 01:07:36.548
(Was the daytime date with Bon Hee that strong?)

01:07:36.572 --> 01:07:37.572
(This is hard.)

01:07:37.573 --> 01:07:38.712
Will it not matter?

01:07:39.812 --> 01:07:42.712
(The second daytime date)

01:07:43.952 --> 01:07:47.651
(The younger man waiting for his daytime date is...)

01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:48.652
It's Mu Jin.

01:07:49.392 --> 01:07:51.562
- He is... - Who is he going on a date with?

01:07:55.262 --> 01:07:57.701
- Who did Mu Jin choose? - Who is it? I'm so curious.

01:07:57.702 --> 01:07:58.862
I'm so curious.

01:07:59.332 --> 01:08:00.762
- Who is it? - The daytime date.

01:08:01.532 --> 01:08:05.701
(An older woman walks towards Mu Jin.)

01:08:05.702 --> 01:08:07.502
- Is it So Hyun? - So Hyun?

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:10.541
Mu Jin.

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:11.982
It's So Hyun.

01:08:12.442 --> 01:08:13.912
- Nice. - Nice.

01:08:15.012 --> 01:08:16.181
- When did you come? - Goodness.

01:08:16.182 --> 01:08:18.581
(So Hyun is Mu Jin's daytime date.)

01:08:18.582 --> 01:08:19.952
It's nice to see you.

01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:22.151
How did you come here?

01:08:22.152 --> 01:08:23.491
What do you mean?

01:08:23.492 --> 01:08:26.761
Coming here, did you know I was the one wanting to talk?

01:08:26.762 --> 01:08:27.792
Right.

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:29.961
Yes, I knew.

01:08:29.962 --> 01:08:31.431
(So Hyun was chosen by Mu Jin.)

01:08:31.432 --> 01:08:33.802
And I wanted to talk to you too.

01:08:35.132 --> 01:08:36.132
(So Hyun and Mu Jin are on their first date.)

01:08:36.133 --> 01:08:37.941
Is this their first date?

01:08:37.942 --> 01:08:39.618
- It's their 1st date. - It's their 1st date.

01:08:39.642 --> 01:08:41.672
This is so awkward.

01:08:41.842 --> 01:08:43.842
(Laughing)

01:08:44.742 --> 01:08:45.911
(She takes a sip of the water first.)

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:49.111
- You never get awkward though. - Me?

01:08:49.112 --> 01:08:53.281
But it's awkward to talk 1-on-1.

01:08:53.282 --> 01:08:54.822
In an unfamiliar space, at that.

01:08:56.952 --> 01:08:58.622
I wanted to talk to you.

01:08:59.862 --> 01:09:02.792
(Staring)

01:09:02.932 --> 01:09:03.962
(Nodding)

01:09:06.962 --> 01:09:08.132
This feels really new.

01:09:08.532 --> 01:09:11.301
So Hyun is awkward and yet...

01:09:11.302 --> 01:09:13.202
- And happy. - She's happy. Oh, dear.

01:09:14.202 --> 01:09:16.642
Did you get to talk to the guys much?

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:17.912
I...

01:09:18.282 --> 01:09:20.382
Who did you talk to and what did you talk about?

01:09:21.312 --> 01:09:22.781
- I want to know. - You want to know?

01:09:22.782 --> 01:09:24.142
Did you talk to many of the girls?

01:09:24.312 --> 01:09:26.522
- I didn't get to talk to many. - Right.

01:09:27.552 --> 01:09:28.552
And...

01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:31.022
when you arrived,

01:09:32.022 --> 01:09:34.162
I thought you were really pretty.

01:09:35.362 --> 01:09:37.162
The way you talked...

01:09:37.432 --> 01:09:40.661
Your aura, should I say?

01:09:40.662 --> 01:09:42.002
You seemed confident.

01:09:42.772 --> 01:09:45.442
I thought it would be difficult for me to approach you.

01:09:46.742 --> 01:09:48.141
- Right. - That's what I thought.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.472
(She hears Mu Jin's thoughts for the first time.)

01:09:50.672 --> 01:09:53.642
When I look at a woman,

01:09:54.882 --> 01:09:56.981
I prefer someone who's got that human touch...

01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:01.152
to someone who's too perfect.

01:10:01.392 --> 01:10:03.651
I get more drawn to someone like that.

01:10:03.652 --> 01:10:05.061
And I get more curious.

01:10:05.062 --> 01:10:06.562
- Right. - Yes.

01:10:06.962 --> 01:10:09.032
- It's the same for me. - Right.

01:10:09.832 --> 01:10:10.832
We talked...

01:10:11.432 --> 01:10:13.631
alone in private.

01:10:13.632 --> 01:10:15.632
- It wasn't a deep conversation. - Right.

01:10:15.772 --> 01:10:17.032
But we did talk in private.

01:10:17.302 --> 01:10:19.972
And we went on that group date yesterday.

01:10:20.802 --> 01:10:22.542
That made me see the human side of you.

01:10:23.772 --> 01:10:25.381
- He saw it too late. - He realized it too late.

01:10:25.382 --> 01:10:26.942
- It's the last day. - That's why...

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:29.311
I wanted to talk to you more.

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:32.221
(That's why I wanted to talk to you more.)

01:10:32.222 --> 01:10:36.422
Of the people I wanted to talk to first...

01:10:37.552 --> 01:10:39.592
when I arrived,

01:10:40.992 --> 01:10:42.661
- you were one. - He was.

01:10:42.662 --> 01:10:44.162
It was Mu Jin and Sang Hyeon.

01:10:44.432 --> 01:10:46.001
We locked eyes,

01:10:46.002 --> 01:10:48.901
and we had small chats here and there. When you reacted...

01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:51.172
and we did small talk,

01:10:51.772 --> 01:10:55.272
I thought you were a good man.

01:10:55.442 --> 01:10:59.082
Then we had a chance to talk one night.

01:11:00.482 --> 01:11:01.911
Right. That's the time.

01:11:01.912 --> 01:11:04.821
(Two days ago, they got to chat unexpectedly.)

01:11:04.822 --> 01:11:06.581
Do you like your job?

01:11:06.582 --> 01:11:09.022
I think I've been doing it because I enjoy it.

01:11:09.092 --> 01:11:11.361
I wanted to marry early.

01:11:11.362 --> 01:11:12.362
(I see.)

01:11:12.363 --> 01:11:13.991
Having marriage in mind,

01:11:13.992 --> 01:11:16.662
I wanted to find a stable job.

01:11:16.892 --> 01:11:18.802
So I got a job very early.

01:11:20.162 --> 01:11:26.402
(Having a sincere conversation, they got to know about each other.)

01:11:27.842 --> 01:11:28.842
I loved...

01:11:31.012 --> 01:11:34.551
the flow of our conversation.

01:11:34.552 --> 01:11:36.951
I loved how slowly you talked.

01:11:36.952 --> 01:11:40.322
And I loved that you were sharing your worries with me.

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:42.252
It felt comfortable.

01:11:42.692 --> 01:11:45.691
That made me want to talk to you a little more.

01:11:45.692 --> 01:11:47.222
That night's conversation...

01:11:47.362 --> 01:11:48.362
must've affected Mu Jin's decision too.

01:11:48.363 --> 01:11:50.491
- I had the exact same thought. - Did you?

01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:51.892
Talking to you, I didn't have to...

01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:55.602
force myself to come up with a topic.

01:11:57.532 --> 01:11:59.042
I think the conversation...

01:11:59.142 --> 01:12:01.642
- Right. - flowed naturally.

01:12:02.212 --> 01:12:06.281
I felt the comfort I didn't get to feel...

01:12:06.282 --> 01:12:08.752
through other people, and that's why I was more drawn to you.

01:12:08.912 --> 01:12:12.852
That's Mu Jin's strength.

01:12:14.082 --> 01:12:18.362
When we went ice skating,

01:12:18.962 --> 01:12:20.421
it helped me hugely that you were there.

01:12:20.422 --> 01:12:22.331
- It was really fun. - Right.

01:12:22.332 --> 01:12:24.062
When we went ice skating,

01:12:24.932 --> 01:12:26.332
I felt that too.

01:12:28.172 --> 01:12:30.102
You caught my attention a little more too.

01:12:32.142 --> 01:12:34.441
(On the way back from the group date)

01:12:34.442 --> 01:12:37.241
Why don't we each share one thing...

01:12:37.242 --> 01:12:40.741
that's been most memorable...

01:12:40.742 --> 01:12:41.882
about the stay?

01:12:42.552 --> 01:12:44.622
I'm sure everyone has an answer to that,

01:12:45.782 --> 01:12:48.452
but there's no need to say it aloud.

01:12:49.192 --> 01:12:52.522
(So Hyun wasn't happy to hear Sang Hyeon's answer.)

01:12:53.222 --> 01:12:55.562
(Getting conscious)

01:12:55.662 --> 01:12:57.631
Did you get to travel a lot to warm countries?

01:12:57.632 --> 01:13:03.131
(Conscious of So Hyun, Mu Jin talked to her.)

01:13:03.132 --> 01:13:04.372
Really?

01:13:05.102 --> 01:13:08.142
(Actually, Mu Jin was conscious of So Hyun.)

01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:12.042
I could tell what was going in your mind.

01:13:12.682 --> 01:13:14.682
- What was going in my mind? - Yes.

01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:18.981
That's why I was more conscious of you.

01:13:18.982 --> 01:13:22.822
I think I was having similar thoughts myself.

01:13:23.752 --> 01:13:25.322
They look good together, don't they?

01:13:25.862 --> 01:13:27.791
They always looked good together.

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:28.831
(They talk comfortably with the same frequency.)

01:13:28.832 --> 01:13:30.832
It's good that they chose to go on a daytime date.

01:13:31.262 --> 01:13:32.402
- You think so? - Yes.

01:13:34.232 --> 01:13:35.702
Don't you feel sorry, though?

01:13:36.002 --> 01:13:37.471
- Don't I feel sorry about what? - Yes.

01:13:37.472 --> 01:13:38.771
That you joined us late?

01:13:38.772 --> 01:13:39.842
Right.

01:13:40.902 --> 01:13:42.412
It might have been...

01:13:42.872 --> 01:13:46.212
nice to have more time.

01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:49.052
That occurred to me.

01:13:51.212 --> 01:13:53.482
- I think it would've been nice. - Goodness.

01:13:53.782 --> 01:13:55.652
- She must've felt that strongly. - Right.

01:13:58.162 --> 01:14:01.262
We feel comfortable when we talk.

01:14:02.162 --> 01:14:03.962
Does Mu Jin feel sorry too?

01:14:04.262 --> 01:14:05.262
He might be.

01:14:06.532 --> 01:14:09.172
Would things have been different if I joined from the start?

01:14:12.072 --> 01:14:13.672
(Thinking)

01:14:14.002 --> 01:14:15.112
He's thinking about it.

01:14:17.542 --> 01:14:18.582
We never know.

01:14:19.082 --> 01:14:20.682
- That's possible. - Yes.

01:14:23.312 --> 01:14:25.022
I think that's very possible.

01:14:26.922 --> 01:14:29.321
Doesn't Mu Jin look shaken?

01:14:29.322 --> 01:14:34.522
(They go quiet.)

01:14:37.362 --> 01:14:40.461
(It was their first date.)

01:14:40.462 --> 01:14:43.431
(Where will their hearts lean?)

01:14:43.432 --> 01:14:45.141
Watching them, I realized this.

01:14:45.142 --> 01:14:47.441
I think life is all about timing.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:48.642
It's the same with dating too.

01:14:48.842 --> 01:14:50.741
If those two had met first...

01:14:50.742 --> 01:14:53.782
and Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon met in the beginning,

01:14:54.142 --> 01:14:57.181
- you don't know... - The story would be so different.

01:14:57.182 --> 01:14:59.058
- how things would've gone. - I'm curious about that too.

01:14:59.082 --> 01:15:00.651
- We'd have no idea. - That sounds so crazy.

01:15:00.652 --> 01:15:02.991
So, I think it's all about timing.

01:15:02.992 --> 01:15:05.368
(Love is about timing! A life lesson learned from Noona is A Woman to Me)

01:15:05.392 --> 01:15:08.862
(The third Day Date chosen by the younger men)

01:15:10.562 --> 01:15:13.731
(Waiting for his Day Date partner...)

01:15:13.732 --> 01:15:14.801
(is Sang Won.)

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.202
- Sang Won? - Oh, Sang Won.

01:15:16.802 --> 01:15:18.401
Who is Sang Won meeting during the day?

01:15:18.402 --> 01:15:19.942
- Sang Won. - I really don't know.

01:15:21.742 --> 01:15:23.371
Appearance-wise, she's so pretty,

01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:24.888
so I'm curious about what kind of person she is.

01:15:24.912 --> 01:15:27.018
She's the closest to my ideal type in terms of looks.

01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:29.882
Whether it's by going on dates or having conversations,

01:15:30.512 --> 01:15:32.122
I think I could make more of an effort.

01:15:34.082 --> 01:15:37.891
(Which older woman is Sang Won's ideal type and Day Date partner?)

01:15:37.892 --> 01:15:38.892
Oh, my.

01:15:40.022 --> 01:15:41.631
- I'm here. - You're here.

01:15:41.632 --> 01:15:43.391
- It's So Hyun. - My goodness.

01:15:43.392 --> 01:15:45.201
(It's So Hyun.)

01:15:45.202 --> 01:15:46.762
So Hyun is going on two dates.

01:15:46.862 --> 01:15:48.932
I might only know at the very end,

01:15:49.032 --> 01:15:51.642
but if I have the chance, I think I could at least try.

01:15:54.442 --> 01:15:57.072
(D-1 from final decision day, the last date continues.)

01:15:58.412 --> 01:16:00.841
(Someone I'm drawn to because she's different from me...)

01:16:00.842 --> 01:16:04.552
(versus someone I'm drawn to because she's similar to me)

01:16:05.622 --> 01:16:07.421
(You were going back and forth...)

01:16:07.422 --> 01:16:09.422
(quite a lot.)

01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:13.492
(After hearing him, I felt very confused.)

01:16:14.392 --> 01:16:15.531
(Realistic worries...)

01:16:15.532 --> 01:16:17.662
(have started happening again.)

01:16:18.602 --> 01:16:22.272
(We have an issue that we have to resolve.)

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:26.102
(I'm going to go inside.)

01:16:26.472 --> 01:16:28.911
(The night at Yeon House gets complicated...)

01:16:28.912 --> 01:16:31.312
(before the final decision.)

01:16:33.182 --> 01:16:34.912
(Is Ye Eun back?)

01:16:36.412 --> 01:16:37.881
(I don't want...)

01:16:37.882 --> 01:16:39.422
(Ji Won to come.)

01:16:39.522 --> 01:16:40.951
(I was curious...)

01:16:40.952 --> 01:16:42.191
(about So Hyun...)

01:16:42.192 --> 01:16:44.022
(a lot.)

01:16:46.022 --> 01:16:47.221
(I was anxious...)

01:16:47.222 --> 01:16:48.832
(and frustrated.)

01:16:49.262 --> 01:16:51.862
(It is a big enough variable that could change my decision.)

01:16:53.862 --> 01:16:59.602
(Bon Hee might worry a bit more than me.)

01:17:00.372 --> 01:17:03.142
(Do I look like I'm worried about something?)

01:17:04.312 --> 01:17:05.642
I'm not really sure.
