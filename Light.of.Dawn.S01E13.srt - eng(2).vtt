=Light of Dawn=

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.510
Let him alone.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.870
Making this decision

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.790
wasn't easy.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.790
Put yourself in his shoes.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.040
If one day,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280
something happened to me,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.360
would you turn me in?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.630
I'm saying if.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.870
I've always kept this tape.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.470
I've never shown it to you.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
Today, let's watch it together.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.240
Mr. Xu didn't have much hair
from a young age.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.630
He had a big head.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.240
It was filled with wisdom.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.190
The woman beside him is Qu Meng.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.310
She's Gao Feng's mother.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.240
She was very close to your mother.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.150
It was as if they were twins.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.630
But I still couldn't figure out

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.520
why they did

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.430
what they did.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.240
Dad, I told you
to cut your ties with the past.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.960
Now, you're bringing up
all these old issues again.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.080
Can we still have
a heart-to-heart conversation?

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.080
Of course.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.520
Come, try to steal the ball.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.800
Go on. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.070
Come, steal the ball.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.920
Come.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.660
(Grave of Xu Peng)

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.100
With the minor crime you've committed,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.070
you should've been released long ago

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.880
since your father-in-law
was an influential figure.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.720
Just when all the evidence

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.070
points to your father,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.630
they release you.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.460
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.830
You're Gao Feng, huh?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.920
Sometimes, I'm also curious

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.000
as to the kind of person your father is.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.720
If he did commit all those crimes,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.510
would Wu Guohao
even commit arson and murder

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.600
20 years later to destroy evidence

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.480
and cover his tracks?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.120
What exactly are you trying to say here?
What's your goal?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.360
I think they must be
close to each other.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.870
Gao Feng, I know
my family has let you down.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.920
We know our faults now.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.310
Please spare us.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.270
Okay?

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.100
I heard that you're going
to be a father soon.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.720
At this moment, you came back
to take a look at your father

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.920
and try to figure out
the kind of person he is.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.490
That's pretty meaningful.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.040
Fine.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.390
For my child's sake,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.360
please spare us,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.040
okay?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.800
If you truly care about your child,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.360
you should think this through.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.630
Don't be like Wu Feifei.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.750
She lived in obscurity.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.940
(Grave of Xu Peng)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.950
The investigation into
the 1009 traffic collision,

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.120
the corpse discovered at Penglai Plaza,
the arson in the attic,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.800
and related incidents

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.120
have now largely been clarified.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.100
According to the testimony
of witness Li Churan,

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.360
the key individual Madam He colluded
with Wang Dan to crash into the statue,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.240
thereby drawing police attention,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.560
stirring public sentiment,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.750
and luring another key witness,
Gao Feng, into the scheme.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.950
The aim was to expose
the illegal transactions

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.480
involving the well-known
entertainment venue,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.990
Binchuan International Club,
during the 1990s.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.480
Other departments
working jointly on the case

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.670
have begun follow-up investigations.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.160
Should any direct connection
be found between them

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.630
and the International Club's
illegal dealings

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.000
we will take control measures

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.040
against the Penglai Group

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.390
and the relevant individuals
at the earliest opportunity.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.600
In a second examination of the scene
where the body was found,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.510
forensic technicians identified

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.430
a previously overlooked clue.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.310
Due to the complex cement structure
at the base of the square statue,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.000
an item resembling a belt buckle
was concealed as exhibit.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.440
Previously, forensic experts
had conducted multiple examinations.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.030
By analyzing the fracture injuries
on the cadaver's hyoid bone,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.260
(Case Report)
they preliminarily determined

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.360
that the weapon that caused
Qu Meng's death was a belt.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.870
Everyone,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.510
let me just say this upfront.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.870
You guys know
how influential Penglai Group is.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.840
Once we start digging,
more dirt is bound to come out.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.120
In 2018, a national campaign was held

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.630
to combat organized crime
and eliminate evil forces.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.120
If Penglai Group
is confirmed to be involved,

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.240
this time,

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.630
we have to get to the bottom of it.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.840
No matter if it's the past

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.150
or the present,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.790
we must ensure that facts are clear,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.490
conclusive evidence is obtained,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.790
and evil is eliminated.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.510
Mr. Xu's belt?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.840
That's right.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:21.960
They say

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.030
the belt buckle was discovered
at the burial site

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.960
of the statue's remains.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.270
They told me to claim it.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.080
But quite some time has passed.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.480
The belt buckle has a bird pattern.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.360
Was it a roc?

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.720
It's a bird that resembles an eagle.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.480
Impossible.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.870
This is impossible.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.550
I suppose Qu Meng did corner Mr. Xu.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.080
My father wouldn't
even dare to gut a fish. Why would he...

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.840
Back then, I was outside the room.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.630
I wanted to stop him.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.270
But he chased me out of the room...

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.320
My father would never kill.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.720
He's not a murderer.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.360
Trust me.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.670
He could never be a murderer!

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.840
Yang.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.200
Calm down...

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.000
How can I calm down? How can I?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.620
How do you guys expect me to calm down?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.270
Fine.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.750
Even if he did murder someone,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.670
how could he be so foolish as to

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.440
leave the body and
the belt buckle inside the statue?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.320
Did he lose his mind?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.570
Something's off.
I'm sure someone is trying to frame him.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.270
Who's trying to frame him?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.960
Was it you?

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.750
Was it you?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.510
Xu Zhiyang!

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.270
Let's clarify things.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.080
Once we clarify things,

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.390
you guys will be able to understand

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.870
why there were so many things

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.080
I have to keep to myself.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.750
Mr. Xu was the one

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.750
who buried Qu Meng's body in the statue.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.000
But why?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.000
It was meant to be a warning.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.080
Back then,
Qu Meng was causing a commotion.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.870
She even instigated others to join her.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.720
In order to stop their commotion

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.270
and make them submit,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.030
Mr. Xu came up

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.870
with that ruthless idea.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.080
Did you know why

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.960
I kept all these things to myself?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.240
It was because
I was worried about you, Yang.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.360
I was afraid that you couldn't take it.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.240
Some things

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.120
are cruel enough just to know.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.670
Whatever happens to me is fine

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.480
if the older generation's affairs
had involved me.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.910
I just didn't want you two
to know about these shady dealings.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.320
I just hope that you two

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.840
will stay sunny

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.200
and happy.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.600
Understood?

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.150
Sorry, Yang.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.670
I promised you.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.510
This is the last thing

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.870
I'm hiding from you.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.300
=Episode 13=
=Exhibit=

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.320
You shouldn't stay outside.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.510
Head to your room.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.240
It's cold out here.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.480
You should have something.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.320
Don't let my grandchild starve.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.150
Don't panic.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.720
I'll discuss this with
Mr. Cao right away.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:38.750
It's pointless.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.840
The cops have already found the belt.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:48.480
We don't know
what will happen after this.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.390
If you keep covering this up
out of emotional attachment,

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.120
you'll be putting
the entire group at serious risk.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.320
Give it to me.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.120
I'll hand it over.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.120
Be a good boy. Give it to me.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.080
If you turn in evidence
of your father's crimes,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.630
that's called putting duty
before family ties.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.600
Legally speaking,
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.000
But morally speaking,

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.630
what do you think

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.440
people inside and outside of the group

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.720
will say and think about you,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.790
especially the elders
who worked for your father?

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.890
Can you bear
the weight of public opinion?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.960
You'll be the subject of gossip
for the rest of your life.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.840
Be a good boy.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.390
Give it to me.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.510
Dad.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.720
From now on,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.720
we should let him
decide for himself, okay?

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960
What should I do?

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.960
I seriously don't know.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.390
Dawg.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.720
This concerns more than the company.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.720
I cannot help you make a decision.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.840
If I do, I'm afraid

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.450
you'll blame me for it
for the rest of your life.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.750
But no matter what decision you make,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.360
I'll never blame you for it.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.630
The kind of person your father is

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.990
has nothing to do with who you are.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.550
I trust you.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.030
You should trust

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.510
that I'll always stay by your side.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.440
Mr. Wu Guohao,

00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:28.175
we are now conducting an inquiry

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.110
regarding the alleged involvement
of Binchuan International Club

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.310
in illegal sexual transactions.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.200
Please answer our questions honestly.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.590
As the primary person in charge
of the club at that time,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.790
were you aware of,
involved in, assisting,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.070
or suspected of
engaging in illegal sexual transactions?

I don't know anything.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.350
As Xu Peng's business partner
and best friend,

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.000
were you aware of, involved in,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.350
or concealed the violent incident
in which Xu Peng murdered Qu Meng?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.400
I'm not sure.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.790
Gao Feng,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.920
based on the current progress
of the case investigation

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.680
and your status as
a direct relative of the victim,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.510
we now need
to share some information with you.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.550
Did you locate the culprit
who murdered my mother?

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.350
Xu Zhiyang came here to submit evidence.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.850
Rumors have been
circulating outside the entire day.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.750
Judging from
the current evidence we have,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.310
the culprit is Xu Peng.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.400
However, we've located
some new leads as well.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.590
Our colleagues from
the Technical Appraisal Center

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.790
used a special method

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.590
to open the golden ball
you handed to us.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.480
Inside the golden ball,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.350
we discovered a series
of hand-engraved numbers.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.000
We think

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.350
that there's
a special meaning to the numbers.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.880
I never knew

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.200
that this stuff could be opened.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.270
I don't know

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.000
what the numbers mean either.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.590
The Technical Appraisal Center

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.110
scanned the golden ball.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.550
We found out

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
that someone had replated

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.590
the surface of the ball.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.550
Their goal was to cover the cut mark

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.160
on the ball.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:05.640
So, what she wanted to say

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.000
had always been inside here.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.240
Gao Feng, we called you here today

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.720
because we wanted to know

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.030
if you had found any other leads.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.680
Nothing comes to mind for now.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.500
However, perhaps I could try again

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.750
with real-world discoveries.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.750
I met Xu Zhiyang a few days ago.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.400
He was in a poor state of mind.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.680
Perhaps there were
internal problems within his family.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.960
And,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.510
do you guys truly think
that Wu Guohao is innocent?

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.960
He told me personally

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.640
that he knew everything
Xu Peng had done.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:45.680
Maybe I can

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.750
provide another breakthrough approach.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.920
My mother's murderer has been found.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.720
I guess I can finally
put this behind me.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.200
Xu Zhiyang handed over the evidence
of his father's crime to you all.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.720
To him,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.750
I think he can finally
put this behind him as well.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.240
But there's one more person.

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:18.590
I don't think it's that easy

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.120
for her to put this behind her.

to ask you to identify her.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.550

bear to abandon her own daughter?

Ms. Wu, you'll be a mother soon.

You should be able to understand.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.360
A mother would never abandon her child

that she hadn't given up on loving you.

On the contrary,

I'm sure she loved you very much.

Why do you think
she chose to come back now?

It's because she knew

all sins would be exposed one day.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.590
It's because she believes

It's a little big for you.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.720
Just make do with it, okay?

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.030
Back when you were
out and about every day,

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:48.640
you didn't even call me once in a month.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:50.720
Whenever I was on my phone,

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.510
I saw news about
backpackers getting into trouble.

I was so worried about you.

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:58.350
I didn't know which snowy mountain
you were exploring at all.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.100
It's auspicious
if you wear the shirt I bought.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.240
The size won't matter too much.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.830
I bought it at a discount.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.550
Sit down. Come.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:25.680

once you're done with your stuff,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.240
the lakes,

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.830
and the grasslands you mentioned.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.550
I might not be able to hike anymore.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640
But I guess it's fine to wander
at the foot of the mountain.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.160
I've never been out there before.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.400
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.240
You were implicated

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.930
just because I investigated the case.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.830
I'm fine with no matter
what they throw at me.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.540
But they can't just
write such filthy words

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.400
on our door.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.030
Feng,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.640
from now on, I'll support you
no matter what you do.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:33.030
You can wander out there.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.480
If you're tired

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.390
or if you're suffering out there,

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.590
you can come back.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.200
I'll wait for you at home.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.160
Have some water.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:55.720
Sit and rest.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.070
I'll try my best to clean it.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:14.550
Let me do it.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.400
(Happy Birthday)
What do you want to do, then?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.350
It's so pretty.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.830
Mom!

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.270
You want Mom?

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.480
You have two moms over here.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.600
Your mom is here.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:45.190
Here, blow out the candles.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.400
Here, Feifei.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.240
Happy birthday to you.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.070
Happy birthday to you.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.030
Feifei.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.990
You're watching the same video again.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.160
I went to see her today.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.350
She was lying on the autopsy table.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.200
Why can I never see her face clearly?

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.750
Her face was blurry in the portrait.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.000
Today, her face is scorched.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.350
Did her face

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.000
look the way you imagined?

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.200
She was burned beyond recognition.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.270
Did she know
that you were already all grown up?

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.480
Did she know
that you'd already gotten married?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.480
Did she know that you were
going to be a mother soon?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.200
Did she know

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.680
that I'd already become a robot
that was carrying a machine?

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.920
She only did the things
she wanted to do.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.440
She was too selfish!

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.240
Has she ever thought about our present?

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.110
Let's not bring her up.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.160
Feifei.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.270
You and Yang should leave.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.880
Go somewhere else.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.200
Start a new life out there.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.070
I'm not leaving.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.030
You should put the past behind you.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.370
It's not that easy
to put the past behind me.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.360
Whether or not I can
get over this hurdle in my heart

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.880
has nothing to do with where I live.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.030
Can we still return
to the good old days?

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.590
The ties of blood cannot be erased.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.920
You guys

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.920
should

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.960
stay together.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.630
The sports shoes,

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.880
they're cleaned.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.230
Hello, Yang.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.070
If you're reading this letter,

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.150
that means

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.070
it's time for me
to bid farewell to this world.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.190
I always wondered

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.480
if you would find this letter.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.190
If you're reading this,

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.000
I suppose there are two possibilities.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.630
Firstly, you'll find
this letter quickly.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.400
That means you'll get over
this hurdle of mine very quickly

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.070
and you'll run on the grasslands

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.550
while wearing the same sports shoes.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.670
If that's the case,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.440
I want to tell you this.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.840
Yang,

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.800
I love you.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.190
As for the other possibility,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.150
you'll only find this letter
after a long time.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.440
If that's the case,

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.630
I suppose you've found out
about my past.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.160
You'll be disappointed in me

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.150
and wish to get rid of the sports shoes.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.150
I assume there are certain things
you will want to know.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.800
I've committed
a lot of wrong deeds in my life.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.030
The club I operated
involved sex transactions.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.230
I harmed a man called Yang Wenyuan.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.630
I even strangled a woman called Qu Meng

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.280
to death.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.030
There are plenty
of other things as well.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.880
I want to tell you them myself.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.960
What to do from here

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.400
is up to you.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:25.760
You're already

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.360
a real man.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.550
I'm not a good person.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.190
But I'm not evil to the core.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:35.670
Yang,

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:37.760
he was the one

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.840
who forced me to do everything.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:42.710
Wu Guohao is the devil.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.480
He had always been the devil.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.340
(Penglai Group)
The past year has been one

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.360
of soaring growth

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.960
and strategic expansion
for Penglai Group.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.920
(1995-1996 Annual Summary Meeting)

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.800
(Penglai Group)
We secured Penglai Plaza

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.630
and a flagship real estate project

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.000
in the development zone.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.230
We must confront
the transformation of our industry

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.630
and align with
the broader trend of sector improvement.

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.190
We must also explore

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.000
(Wu Guohao)
new industries and new fields.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.320
Our group will be making
a major move next.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.920
I hope everyone can
focus on the bigger picture

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:15.990
and try your best to cooperate.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:16.760
Now,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:18.150
let's work hard together

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.710
and create a new prosperous era.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.630
Lastly, I want to give
special thanks to an individual.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.630
He's the most
important person in the group.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.700
He's the soul of our group.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.280
He's the person in charge
of Binchuan International Club,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.320
and the deputy GM of Penglai Group,

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.400
Mr. Wu Guohao!

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.070
Let's welcome him to the stage.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.000
