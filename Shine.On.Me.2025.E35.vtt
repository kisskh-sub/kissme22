00:01:42.612 --> 00:01:43.151
Ms. Qian,

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:44.412
it's midyear.

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:45.672
Your property fee is overdue.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.151
What does that have to do with me?

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:48.612
Go to whoever is necessary.

00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:57.351
Gong?

00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.392
Why are you calling?

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:01.272
Did Chengyuan ask you to call me?

00:02:02.132 --> 00:02:03.091
How is he?

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.351
Is he coming over now?

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:06.532
There's good news.

00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:07.791
The swindlers have been caught.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:09.452
But they've spent all the money.

00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:09.971
Ms. Qian,

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.512
Mr. Nie was sick and hospitalized.

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:13.852
He's still recuperating.

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.512
I'll tell him the news.

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:17.612
But later he probably can't

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:18.832
take care of you anymore.

00:02:18.832 --> 00:02:20.062
Don't contact him anymore.

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:21.072
He thinks

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:22.232
the house you live in now

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:23.952
isn't well-located.

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:27.012
I'm calling to tell you

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.862
that I'll take potential buyers
over soon.

00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:31.031
I hope you empty it soon.

00:02:31.104 --> 00:02:32.214
It's the best for all.

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:34.492
What?

00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:37.332
Is he trying

00:02:37.332 --> 00:02:38.691
to kick me out?

00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.631
I can't accept that.

00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:41.992
It won't be that easy.

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:42.691
Is Nie Chengyuan

00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:43.452
at the company now?

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:44.371
I'll go see him now.

00:02:44.576 --> 00:02:46.336
When Mr. Nie doesn't want to see you,

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:47.471
making a scene is futile.

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:48.792
If you make it ugly,

00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:50.871
what you took before will be gone too.

00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:51.552
Ms. Qian,

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.852
please think twice.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.792
Think twice?

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.332
Nonsense!

00:02:59.052 --> 00:03:00.952
Wanting me gone so easily?

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:02.072
No way.

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.191
The owner is eager to sell.

00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.772
Buying this house
will be a good decision.

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:09.392
Its interior decoration

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:10.211
and location

00:03:10.251 --> 00:03:11.112
are excellent.

00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:11.631
The decor

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:12.191
might not be

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.012
the style I like.

00:03:15.651 --> 00:03:16.172
Mr. Gong?

00:03:17.732 --> 00:03:18.232
Hello.

00:03:18.232 --> 00:03:18.832
Hello.

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:19.931
They're the buyers.

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:20.792
Hello.

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.751
The garden area looks quite spacious.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:24.431
Is the house vacant now?

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:25.471
Currently...

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:27.272
I saw you from upstairs.

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:28.512
So I hurried down.

00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:29.151
Hurry.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:30.832
Come on in.

00:03:30.832 --> 00:03:31.811
- Someone's here?
- Let's go.

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:34.311
I've taken photos.

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:34.971
Please.

00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:36.431
Come in quickly. Let's go.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:44.471
Feel free to look around.

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:45.651
Feel at home.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.095
I thought the house was empty.

00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:49.992
Are you the owner?

00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:52.552
Ms. Qian is the tenant.

00:03:56.151 --> 00:03:56.651
Yes.

00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:58.072
I'm the tenant.

00:03:58.512 --> 00:03:59.371
Not the owner.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:00.672
However.

00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:01.672
I've lived here

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:02.792
for several years now.

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:04.591
If you want to know the details,

00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:06.211
ask me. I know best.

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:08.172
So you're moving out?

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:09.012
Yes.

00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:11.772
Actually,

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:14.832
I've grown attached to this place.

00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:17.371
Hadn't

00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:19.992
my husband

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:21.112
gotten sick here and died,

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:24.451
I wouldn't move out.

00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:26.492
Someone died in this house?

00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:28.732
What's wrong with you?

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:30.691
I warned you repeatedly

00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:32.472
to investigate it thoroughly

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.451
to avoid such things.

00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:35.212
A-And you've recommended me
such a house?

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:35.871
Aren't you

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:37.131
wasting my time?

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.532
We've already

00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:39.811
made careful inquiries.

00:04:40.691 --> 00:04:41.212
Mr. Gong,

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:42.951
what is going on here?

00:04:43.412 --> 00:04:44.751
No one has died in this house.

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:47.511
Ms. Qian,

00:04:48.052 --> 00:04:48.871
stop such nonsense.

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:49.912
Or you'll be

00:04:50.052 --> 00:04:51.011
held legally liable.

00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:53.672
I misspoke.

00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:56.532
My husband didn't die here.

00:04:57.191 --> 00:04:58.912
He got sick here

00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:00.852
and died outside.

00:05:03.532 --> 00:05:05.052
What kind of place did they even find?

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:11.352
Mr. Gong,

00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:12.891
this isn't how you sell a house.

00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:28.652
Ms. Qian,

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:30.612
Mr. Nie has been

00:05:31.232 --> 00:05:32.292
more than fair to you.

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:33.592
Why did you do that?

00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:34.751
At the right price,

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:36.412
selling this place is only

00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:37.672
a matter of time.

00:05:37.992 --> 00:05:38.912
Your little tricks will

00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:40.511
only cause me some trouble.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.212
They'll achieve nothing.

00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:53.931
Mom,

00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:55.092
what do we do?

00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:57.371
Do we really have to move?

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:03.472
I doubt we'll stay here much longer.

00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:06.511
Nie Chengyuan is truly heartless.

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.732
He ignores past feelings entirely.

00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:11.571
That's just how men are.

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:13.011
Back then,

00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:15.131
if he had met someone better off first,

00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:16.811
he might

00:06:17.251 --> 00:06:19.011
have dumped me faster than I dumped him.

00:06:20.592 --> 00:06:22.511
Quick, pack up all our clothes, bags,

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:23.571
and everything else.

00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:26.852
We'll reclaim the old place
we rented out and move in.

00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:31.852
Anyway,

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.571
I've enjoyed these years.

00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:36.112
I didn't lose.

00:06:40.511 --> 00:06:42.691
How can you say that?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.112
I was living perfectly fine before.

00:06:47.131 --> 00:06:48.431
With our own place,

00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.391
I could have found a stable job

00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:51.648
and married a suitable husband.

00:06:51.852 --> 00:06:52.571
But you

00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.271
changed my life completely.

00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:57.131
You brought me here

00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:58.571
and showed me all of this.

00:06:59.052 --> 00:06:59.852
And you said

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.011
you want us to go back?

00:07:01.052 --> 00:07:02.391
How can I go back?

00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:05.412
Do you know the strange looks

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:08.412
I get every day because of you?

00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:11.371
Everyone here looks down upon me.

00:07:12.191 --> 00:07:13.912
But what could I do?

00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:16.191
When I knew nothing,

00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.391
you dragged me here.

00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.311
I always comforted myself

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:20.871
that things would get better,

00:07:21.852 --> 00:07:23.792
and I'd have a bright and shiny future.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.732
But suddenly, it's all gone.

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:31.811
It's like a dream.

00:07:33.112 --> 00:07:34.352
Moving back to our hometown?

00:07:36.532 --> 00:07:37.931
How will the old neighbors see me?

00:07:38.112 --> 00:07:39.311
How will they laugh at me?

00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.571
My life had just begun,

00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:45.472
and you've ruined it.

00:07:46.052 --> 00:07:46.571
Nianyuan.

00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:48.131
Don't call me that name.

00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:51.492
It makes me sick.

00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.092
Mom,

00:07:55.292 --> 00:07:57.431
you only ever think about yourself.

00:07:58.131 --> 00:07:59.592
You're so selfish.

00:08:18.871 --> 00:08:20.712
If it weren't for you losing money

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:21.631
and dragging me down,

00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:24.331
I'd still be living

00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:25.912
a comfortable life now.

00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:27.520
How dare you...

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:29.751
How dare you blame me?

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.571
I...

00:08:32.832 --> 00:08:34.592
I won't give you a single cent
from now on.

00:08:49.051 --> 00:08:49.592
Rong.

00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:51.871
Siliang.

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:52.771
It's a weekday.

00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:54.031
What brings you here?

00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.212
Here on business?

00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:56.832
Miss, what would you like?

00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:58.212
A latte.

00:08:58.712 --> 00:08:59.271
Please wait.

00:09:00.952 --> 00:09:02.092
I came to say goodbye.

00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:04.952
Goodbye?

00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:07.812
Where are you going?

00:09:08.771 --> 00:09:09.312
Shenzhen.

00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:11.391
My flight is tonight.

00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:13.852
After packing my bags,

00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.072
I realized I had some time.

00:09:15.712 --> 00:09:17.440
Your place is on my way to the airport.

00:09:17.972 --> 00:09:18.891
So I came to see you.

00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:20.832
Actually,

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:22.251
I planned to tell no one.

00:09:25.391 --> 00:09:26.671
So you're

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:29.011
sent by the company?

00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:31.511
No.

00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:33.472
I got a new job.

00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:36.291
Why the sudden

00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:37.891
job change?

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:40.131
Sheng Yuan

00:09:40.212 --> 00:09:41.291
is such a great company.

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:43.312
Many want in but can't.

00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:46.732
I remember

00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.371
I mentioned it last time.

00:09:48.832 --> 00:09:49.712
I was working

00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:50.891
with my boss on a project.

00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:52.871
Right.

00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:54.291
I only found out later

00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:56.572
that one of the competitors

00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.371
was Nie Xiguang's relative.

00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.791
So my boss

00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:02.271
asked me to approach Nie Xiguang

00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:03.171
for information.

00:10:04.952 --> 00:10:06.232
You didn't go, did you?

00:10:07.992 --> 00:10:08.832
Of course not.

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:11.072
How could I possibly

00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:12.791
lower my head?

00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:14.751
Yeah.

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:17.212
You wouldn't.

00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:22.891
Last week, the bid was opened.

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:25.171
My boss lost to them.

00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:27.832
Lost to Xiguang's relative?

00:10:30.312 --> 00:10:31.592
So your boss took it out on you?

00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:34.212
Is that why you quit?

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:36.391
He took it out on everyone.

00:10:38.312 --> 00:10:39.612
He didn't fire me, though.

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:41.832
What reason could he have?

00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:43.492
If he had fired me,

00:10:43.492 --> 00:10:44.288
it might be better.

00:10:44.896 --> 00:10:46.171
I could've gotten severance.

00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:48.612
I quit on my own choice.

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:51.232
He wasn't the kind of

00:10:51.332 --> 00:10:53.232
capable, decisive boss I imagined.

00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:55.332
I don't need to stick around.

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:57.151
Besides,

00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:58.592
everyone knows

00:10:58.732 --> 00:10:59.791
his time is up.

00:11:01.112 --> 00:11:02.171
Staying under him

00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:04.171
offers me no room for advancement.

00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:08.031
Well, getting a new job

00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:09.592
does sound pretty good then.

00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:12.852
But why go all the way to Shenzhen?

00:11:13.192 --> 00:11:14.271
Couldn't you find a new job

00:11:14.332 --> 00:11:14.952
in Shanghai?

00:11:20.592 --> 00:11:21.651
I want a new environment.

00:12:02.832 --> 00:12:04.251
When I graduated from university,

00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:07.072
I always felt

00:12:07.531 --> 00:12:09.051
we'd all stay the same as before.

00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.572
But actually,

00:12:14.992 --> 00:12:16.511
even in the same city,

00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.452
we've drifted apart.

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:22.692
And now,

00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:25.651
you're going even further away.

00:12:31.932 --> 00:12:33.031
Did you say goodbye

00:12:34.612 --> 00:12:35.511
to Zhuang Xu?

00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:40.472
It feels like we said goodbye

00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:43.031
a long time ago.

00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:52.572
During senior year job hunting,

00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.492
I truly believed

00:12:56.871 --> 00:12:57.992
Nie Xiguang didn't tell me

00:12:57.992 --> 00:12:59.131
about my interview call.

00:13:00.592 --> 00:13:01.352
At that time,

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.791
I was both angry and excited.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:06.171
I felt like

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:08.411
I'd finally caught her mistake.

00:13:09.992 --> 00:13:11.671
I couldn't wait to tell everyone.

00:13:15.192 --> 00:13:16.031
Zhuang Xu said

00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:19.732
he was never what I cared about,

00:13:22.144 --> 00:13:23.151
and he was just a tool

00:13:23.151 --> 00:13:24.452
I used to feel superior.

00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:25.791
Maybe I am just

00:13:25.791 --> 00:13:26.531
a tool to you.

00:13:28.492 --> 00:13:29.612
You use me to feel superior.

00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:32.932
I was never the reason

00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:35.754
she became your imaginary rival.

00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:38.511
How could he say that?

00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:42.072
Looking back later,

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.232
maybe

00:13:44.932 --> 00:13:46.112
what he said was right.

00:13:47.812 --> 00:13:48.671
Maybe

00:13:49.952 --> 00:13:50.912
he was never the reason

00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:52.051
I cared about Nie Xiguang.

00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:56.592
I've been trapped

00:13:56.592 --> 00:13:57.712
in my own past.

00:15:11.072 --> 00:15:12.592
Siliang invited Feng and me to dinner.

00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.031
Then I found out about that.

00:15:14.452 --> 00:15:15.312
Why did Rong insist

00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:16.411
on going to Shenzhen?

00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:17.852
Aren't there plenty

00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:18.992
of opportunities here?

00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:22.712
Her suddenly leaving
without saying goodbye

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.312
really left me feeling pretty sad.

00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:29.852
Well,

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:32.871
I might not feel very sad

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:34.011
about her departure.

00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:37.531
But it feels like

00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:40.031
the university days

00:15:41.712 --> 00:15:43.531
have suddenly become truly distant.

00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:44.972
Yeah.

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.011
Be it good or bad,

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.312
only memories are left behind now.

00:15:52.551 --> 00:15:54.151
Everyone has their own choices.

00:15:55.732 --> 00:15:56.751
Wherever she is,

00:15:57.612 --> 00:15:58.531
she will do just fine.

00:15:59.051 --> 00:15:59.751
True.

00:16:00.312 --> 00:16:01.511
I won't worry about her then.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.712
(I'm downstairs at your dorm.)

00:16:13.592 --> 00:16:14.871
Head, I can't talk anymore.

00:16:15.051 --> 00:16:16.092
I'm going out for dinner.

00:16:16.812 --> 00:16:18.332
With your super handsome boyfriend?

00:16:20.332 --> 00:16:20.832
Right.

00:16:21.511 --> 00:16:23.712
And my family.

00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:24.871
Cheers!

00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:26.391
Come on, cheers!

00:16:26.432 --> 00:16:28.692
We've won
that big project from Feng Teng.

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:32.511
Sit down and eat.

00:16:34.352 --> 00:16:34.992
Yun,

00:16:35.432 --> 00:16:37.271
you missed the celebration dinner

00:16:37.271 --> 00:16:37.771
in Nanjing.

00:16:37.771 --> 00:16:39.151
It was such a pity.

00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:41.411
We partied until late at night.

00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:43.212
I had unmovable plans

00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:43.932
that day.

00:16:44.131 --> 00:16:44.671
My bad.

00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:45.791
A drink for me.

00:16:48.251 --> 00:16:48.791
It's fine.

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:50.572
Now, it is our family celebration.

00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:51.712
For such happy news,

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:52.871
don't we have to celebrate

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:53.692
multiple times?

00:16:53.832 --> 00:16:55.112
Yes. Count me in.

00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:57.452
Another one for me.

00:16:58.391 --> 00:16:59.492
I'm a simple person.

00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:01.151
I'm thrilled that you

00:17:01.151 --> 00:17:02.051
snatched that project

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:03.332
from Yuan Cheng.

00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:04.811
Mom, Xiguang, you're amazing.

00:17:04.952 --> 00:17:05.851
I toast to you.

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:06.912
What about me?

00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:08.472
You didn't contribute.

00:17:08.692 --> 00:17:10.111
You know everything,

00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:10.972
you brat.

00:17:11.192 --> 00:17:12.912
All you know is to butter up your mom

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:13.712
and Xiguang.

00:17:13.872 --> 00:17:15.652
Dad, aren't you used to it yet?

00:17:16.111 --> 00:17:16.652
Deep down,

00:17:16.652 --> 00:17:17.652
you're not convinced?

00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:18.591
No.

00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:19.811
Not at all.

00:17:20.632 --> 00:17:21.291
Your mom

00:17:21.632 --> 00:17:22.472
is utterly wise.

00:17:22.771 --> 00:17:23.892
I am completely convinced.

00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:24.831
Y-You...

00:17:24.912 --> 00:17:26.048
Stop trying to sow discord

00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:27.291
to profit from it.

00:17:27.952 --> 00:17:28.531
Come on.

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:29.611
Another round.

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:31.672
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:17:36.212 --> 00:17:37.692
That's all for the first happy thing.

00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:39.432
Now let's talk about something else.

00:17:39.652 --> 00:17:40.892
Xiguang, Lin,

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:42.652
I didn't have time

00:17:42.932 --> 00:17:43.851
to ask more back then.

00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:46.791
What's this about you
buying an apartment?

00:17:50.656 --> 00:17:51.571
Buying an apartment?

00:17:53.152 --> 00:17:53.712
Yeah.

00:17:54.152 --> 00:17:56.271
While we were
at the bid opening meeting,

00:17:56.432 --> 00:17:57.212
they actually

00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.051
went and bought an apartment.

00:17:59.331 --> 00:17:59.992
No way, Xiguang.

00:18:00.111 --> 00:18:01.212
Are you getting married?

00:18:01.472 --> 00:18:02.611
Don't shout nonsense.

00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:04.224
Xiguang and I

00:18:04.224 --> 00:18:05.376
bought a place together.

00:18:05.972 --> 00:18:06.720
Soon,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.936
I'll be working at Songjiang's

00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:09.376
Brain Science Research Center.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.732
So we bought a place

00:18:10.732 --> 00:18:12.091
close to both Xiguang's work

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:12.912
and mine.

00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:14.152
Isn't that just for marriage?

00:18:14.831 --> 00:18:15.992
That's the long-term goal.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.751
For now, it's to avoid
a long-distance relationship.

00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:20.851
Lin,

00:18:21.452 --> 00:18:23.291
you don't seem rushed at all.

00:18:24.952 --> 00:18:25.672
I am anxious,

00:18:26.372 --> 00:18:27.571
but with a peaceful heart,

00:18:27.791 --> 00:18:28.692
I'm not so frantic.

00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:30.732
Besides, Xiguang is still young.

00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:32.251
She just graduated.

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:36.611
Which developer built this place?

00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:38.692
Let me see the floor plan.

00:18:38.932 --> 00:18:39.831
I love seeing those.

00:18:41.492 --> 00:18:42.932
A local developer in Suzhou.

00:18:43.392 --> 00:18:44.640
The next few photos are too.

00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:49.751
It's still in Suzhou?

00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:52.331
That's not close to your workplace.

00:18:52.672 --> 00:18:53.172
It's fine.

00:18:53.392 --> 00:18:54.771
About a fifty-minute drive.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.851
It seems closer to Xiguang's workplace.

00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:01.311
Lin,

00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:03.051
do you plan to commute

00:19:03.172 --> 00:19:04.632
between Suzhou and Shanghai daily?

00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:06.048
Yes, Ms. Jiang.

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:10.812
Won't you find that tiring?

00:19:11.452 --> 00:19:13.412
Won't you feel like
you're sacrificing too much?

00:19:13.824 --> 00:19:15.294
Driving from Songjiang to Lujiazui

00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:17.251
or to my grandparents' place

00:19:17.892 --> 00:19:19.452
could take longer

00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:20.692
than getting to Suzhou

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:21.311
in rush hour.

00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:22.712
So,

00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:24.192
it really can't be called hardship

00:19:24.192 --> 00:19:24.831
or sacrifice.

00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:25.872
Furthermore,

00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:27.331
seeing Xiguang every day

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:28.511
is my own need.

00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:30.051
It's not sacrifice.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.091
That line is perfect.

00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:35.152
I need to write it down.

00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:37.472
I can tell that
to my future girlfriend's parents.

00:19:37.472 --> 00:19:38.051
Jiang Rui,

00:19:38.591 --> 00:19:39.972
you haven't secretly

00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:41.132
been dating someone

00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:42.511
at university, have you?

00:19:43.192 --> 00:19:44.152
No.

00:19:44.152 --> 00:19:44.652
But if I do,

00:19:44.672 --> 00:19:45.591
I'll tell everyone.

00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:46.551
Alright then.

00:19:47.168 --> 00:19:48.912
Next semester's allowance
stays the same.

00:19:48.912 --> 00:19:49.632
No increase.

00:19:49.932 --> 00:19:50.591
What?

00:19:51.452 --> 00:19:52.551
You can't be that unfair.

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:53.152
How can it

00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:54.492
be tied to my dating status?

00:19:54.672 --> 00:19:55.791
I need an extra two hundred.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.652
My current allowance

00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:58.091
can't keep up with my

00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:59.672
growing need for cultural enrichment.

00:20:00.152 --> 00:20:01.152
Be specific.

00:20:03.811 --> 00:20:05.432
Like occasionally playing games.

00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:06.892
Not one cent more.

00:20:11.952 --> 00:20:12.452
By the way,

00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:13.251
Xiguang,

00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:15.492
how did your dad react?

00:20:15.992 --> 00:20:17.872
Dad sent me a WeChat message,

00:20:17.872 --> 00:20:19.111
saying, "Congrats."

00:20:20.132 --> 00:20:21.031
How did you reply?

00:20:21.632 --> 00:20:23.571
At first, I thought,

00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.132
since I only played

00:20:25.172 --> 00:20:26.152
a small part,

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:27.552
I probably shouldn't boast.

00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:28.892
But since he

00:20:28.912 --> 00:20:29.831
congratulated me,

00:20:29.972 --> 00:20:32.031
I just said, "You are most gracious."

00:20:33.551 --> 00:20:34.571
What about Lin's grandpa?

00:20:35.212 --> 00:20:36.251
Did he say anything?

00:20:37.088 --> 00:20:37.920
Before dinner,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.136
I got a call from Grandpa.

00:20:39.328 --> 00:20:41.056
He said he'll come see me
in Suzhou soon.

00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:44.152
Is he coming to Suzhou
to give you a hard time?

00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:45.551
I'll face him with you.

00:20:46.176 --> 00:20:47.168
It didn't sound like it.

00:20:47.652 --> 00:20:48.172
But

00:20:48.392 --> 00:20:50.291
if he really is coming to lecture me,

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.270
I'll bring you along.

00:20:59.751 --> 00:21:00.632
Thank you.

00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:03.200
We'll weather the storm together.

00:21:13.051 --> 00:21:15.331
With the recent announcing
of many supportive policies,

00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:17.811
especially the six-point measures,

00:21:18.271 --> 00:21:19.872
the prospects for the PV industry

00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:21.091
have become very clear.

00:21:22.051 --> 00:21:23.311
At this moment,

00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:24.011
by introducing

00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:26.051
new products
with technological advantages,

00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:28.031
you will definitely capture

00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:29.851
a larger market share in the future.

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:33.791
You've managed Shuangyuan very well.

00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:36.611
I joined later.

00:21:37.232 --> 00:21:37.851
If the company

00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:39.271
can later secure orders

00:21:39.872 --> 00:21:40.652
and stabilize,

00:21:41.492 --> 00:21:42.952
it's mainly because of your support

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:44.132
and Mr. Zhang's

00:21:44.311 --> 00:21:45.652
and the employees' persistence.

00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:49.172
No need to be overly modest.

00:21:50.831 --> 00:21:52.591
Last time, didn't you ask me

00:21:52.632 --> 00:21:53.664
about the name change?

00:21:53.664 --> 00:21:54.771
Why isn't it changed yet?

00:21:57.291 --> 00:21:58.591
Xiguang and I discussed it

00:21:59.311 --> 00:22:01.571
and decided
to secure a few orders first.

00:22:04.412 --> 00:22:05.912
You two are thorough.

00:22:07.351 --> 00:22:08.152
What's the new name?

00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:09.071
Guang Yu?

00:22:09.751 --> 00:22:10.251
Yes.

00:22:13.692 --> 00:22:15.492
A little game between the young couple,

00:22:16.652 --> 00:22:18.172
but it sounds better than Shuangyuan

00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:20.412
and is more fitting for a PV company.

00:22:23.432 --> 00:22:23.932
Grandpa,

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:27.551
besides that,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.831
there's one more thing

00:22:28.831 --> 00:22:30.208
I want to ask for your opinion on.

00:22:30.831 --> 00:22:31.571
What is it?

00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:34.272
I want to establish

00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:36.132
a fifteen percent ESOP pool

00:22:36.608 --> 00:22:39.392
to motivate the company's
technical and managerial staff.

00:22:40.732 --> 00:22:41.591
In the future,

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.051
I'll focus on medical research,

00:22:43.872 --> 00:22:44.851
and Xiguang will step up

00:22:45.472 --> 00:22:46.672
in running the company.

00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:48.531
Therefore,

00:22:49.504 --> 00:22:50.880
I plan for the equity incentive

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.212
to come solely from my shares.

00:22:52.512 --> 00:22:53.872
No pro-rata dilution for others.

00:22:54.592 --> 00:22:57.024
It's similar to the renaming matter.

00:22:58.091 --> 00:22:59.872
Since the shares are all yours now,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.132
you make the decisions entirely.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:04.652
However,

00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:07.192
you must think it through.

00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:08.831
The company bylaws

00:23:09.111 --> 00:23:10.271
clearly state

00:23:10.976 --> 00:23:12.176
that decision-making power

00:23:12.952 --> 00:23:14.392
is absolutely tied

00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:16.872
to shareholding percentage.

00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:18.851
By doing this,

00:23:19.011 --> 00:23:20.652
you effectively lose the ability

00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:22.811
to compete with the Nie girl

00:23:23.232 --> 00:23:25.511
for control of the company.

00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:27.051
I understand.

00:23:27.912 --> 00:23:28.511
Thank you.

00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:30.732
Regarding this,

00:23:31.251 --> 00:23:32.791
has the Nie girl agreed?

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:34.560
I haven't mentioned it to her.

00:23:36.472 --> 00:23:37.872
I wanted your opinion first.

00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:41.031
You asked my opinion on renaming

00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:43.571
and setting up the ESOP.

00:23:44.611 --> 00:23:45.531
Then tell me.

00:23:46.531 --> 00:23:47.692
When you helped

00:23:48.452 --> 00:23:50.452
the Nie girl's relatives

00:23:51.492 --> 00:23:52.712
snatch the project

00:23:52.712 --> 00:23:54.212
from Sheng Yuan's hands,

00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:56.412
why didn't you ask

00:23:56.412 --> 00:23:57.271
for my opinion then?

00:23:58.232 --> 00:23:59.091
About that matter,

00:24:00.212 --> 00:24:01.571
how will you explain it to me?

00:24:04.692 --> 00:24:05.192
Grandpa,

00:24:06.336 --> 00:24:07.648
the PV industry is struggling.

00:24:07.648 --> 00:24:08.732
Opportunities are rare.

00:24:09.392 --> 00:24:10.972
We must seize any sliver of hope.

00:24:12.632 --> 00:24:14.051
If Xingjie had approached me first,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.892
we'd have supported him fully too.

00:24:19.132 --> 00:24:20.591
Is that the truth?

00:24:22.392 --> 00:24:23.232
Half and half.

00:24:25.392 --> 00:24:25.892
Well then,

00:24:27.672 --> 00:24:28.912
what's the false part?

00:24:31.372 --> 00:24:32.492
Xingjie wouldn't come to me.

00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:34.611
So it was just empty talk.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.032
And the true part?

00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:38.412
If he did come to me,

00:24:39.432 --> 00:24:41.392
how could we turn down business?

00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:44.551
But we'd do it grudgingly

00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:46.611
for the money's sake.

00:24:51.392 --> 00:24:53.212
Look at you.

00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:57.412
You've always been a smart kid.

00:24:59.692 --> 00:25:01.152
You and your cleverness.

00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:04.432
If only Xingjie

00:25:06.632 --> 00:25:09.111
had half your intelligence
and composure,

00:25:11.251 --> 00:25:12.492
Sheng Yuan's future

00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:14.232
could be entrusted to him.

00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:18.692
The Feng Teng project

00:25:18.932 --> 00:25:20.571
is an assessment for him.

00:25:21.412 --> 00:25:22.212
What I care about

00:25:22.212 --> 00:25:24.271
isn't just the outcome this time.

00:25:26.111 --> 00:25:27.271
More importantly,

00:25:28.412 --> 00:25:29.932
I want to see the approach he takes

00:25:31.031 --> 00:25:32.872
and the character he displays

00:25:34.551 --> 00:25:35.531
in the process.

00:25:40.952 --> 00:25:42.132
You're in good health.

00:25:42.972 --> 00:25:43.632
The succession

00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:44.851
isn't urgent right now.

00:25:46.031 --> 00:25:46.571
However,

00:25:47.511 --> 00:25:48.551
I have an idea,

00:25:49.232 --> 00:25:50.412
but I'm hesitant to share it.

00:25:51.271 --> 00:25:52.392
Speak freely.

00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:55.692
Actually, I've wanted to suggest

00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:56.992
grooming Xingxiu.

00:25:58.351 --> 00:25:59.031
Xingxiu?

00:26:01.888 --> 00:26:03.271
Both Xingle and Xingxiu are smart.

00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:06.412
But Xingle has a flighty personality

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:08.232
and resists constraints.

00:26:09.791 --> 00:26:11.291
Xingxiu is steady and reserved.

00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:13.392
As a successor candidate,

00:26:14.251 --> 00:26:15.912
Xingxiu might be more suitable.

00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:41.311
Why isn't he back yet?

00:26:52.031 --> 00:26:53.432
When did you get back?

00:26:53.432 --> 00:26:54.511
Why didn't you tell me?

00:26:54.803 --> 00:26:57.372
(Shuangyuan Photovoltaic)

00:26:57.372 --> 00:26:57.932
How did it go?

00:26:58.331 --> 00:26:59.331
Your grandpa has left?

00:26:59.692 --> 00:27:00.632
Did he scold you?

00:27:05.472 --> 00:27:09.392
I did say I'd go with you,

00:27:09.452 --> 00:27:10.892
but work came up.

00:27:13.011 --> 00:27:14.672
The equipment is arriving in a few days.

00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:16.331
There's a lot to confirm.

00:27:19.331 --> 00:27:21.031
So you prioritize work now?

00:27:21.652 --> 00:27:23.331
What will happen in the future?

00:27:24.672 --> 00:27:27.152
Drop the act.

00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:31.892
Actually, work wasn't the main point.

00:27:32.932 --> 00:27:34.011
I thought about it.

00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:35.511
It was better for you two

00:27:35.652 --> 00:27:36.271
to talk alone.

00:27:38.432 --> 00:27:40.392
Thank you for being so considerate.

00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:42.271
You're welcome.

00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:43.291
Don't be too touched.

00:27:44.452 --> 00:27:46.172
So did your grandpa scold you?

00:27:46.932 --> 00:27:47.492
No.

00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:49.672
I even made a request.

00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:51.051
What request?

00:27:51.851 --> 00:27:53.132
I invited Grandpa to officiate

00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:53.952
at the company's

00:27:53.992 --> 00:27:55.392

00:27:57.432 --> 00:27:58.511
Impressive.

00:27:59.031 --> 00:27:59.732
No big deal.

00:28:01.952 --> 00:28:03.071
Let's go. Time to clock out.

00:28:03.591 --> 00:28:04.932
You stood me up today.

00:28:05.091 --> 00:28:06.091
Treat me to dinner.

00:28:06.712 --> 00:28:07.212
Sure.

00:28:07.364 --> 00:28:08.064
To the cafeteria.

00:28:08.064 --> 00:28:09.271
I'll talk a bit of work

00:28:09.291 --> 00:28:10.551
over dinner with Mr. Hua.

00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:12.831
Forget it.

00:28:13.111 --> 00:28:14.232
I just remembered

00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:15.904
(Shuangyuan Photovoltaic)
I have some unfinished work.

00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:18.551
No way.

00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:19.791
Let's go.

00:28:20.051 --> 00:28:21.291
Mr. Lin,

00:28:21.712 --> 00:28:23.351
you haven't resigned yet.

00:28:23.452 --> 00:28:25.172
And even if you do,
you're a shareholder.

00:28:25.172 --> 00:28:26.492
How can you slack off?

00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:28.811
Right now, the industry is booming.

00:28:28.851 --> 00:28:30.751
We need to race against time

00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:32.031
to seize the initiative.

00:28:40.511 --> 00:28:41.192
Let me see.

00:28:43.232 --> 00:28:44.111
Xiguang,

00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:45.692
you wouldn't

00:28:45.692 --> 00:28:47.172
be a secret workaholic, would you?

00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:48.732
Of course not.

00:28:58.152 --> 00:28:59.172
The kiss says you're not.

00:29:02.692 --> 00:29:03.611
When did you become

00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:04.791
so childish?

00:29:14.412 --> 00:29:16.172
The person I'm kissing hasn't changed.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:20.071
So sure?

00:29:20.652 --> 00:29:21.291
How about

00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:22.872
you try kissing me again?

00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:30.132
Still the same.

00:29:36.372 --> 00:29:36.932
Xiguang,

00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:39.751
I've wanted to confirm

00:29:41.011 --> 00:29:42.111
something with you.

00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:43.632
What?

00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:45.672
Are you really interested in management

00:29:46.311 --> 00:29:47.672
and the PV industry?

00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:49.811
Don't force yourself

00:29:49.952 --> 00:29:50.611
for others.

00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:53.351
Why would you worry about that?

00:29:54.912 --> 00:29:55.932
Of course it's because

00:29:55.952 --> 00:29:57.212
I'm genuinely interested.

00:29:58.412 --> 00:30:00.412
But I still

00:30:00.412 --> 00:30:01.892
don't have any grand ambitions.

00:30:01.892 --> 00:30:02.692
For example,

00:30:03.071 --> 00:30:04.511
I don't plan on turning Guang Yu

00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:06.251
into some giant corporation
in the future.

00:30:06.632 --> 00:30:08.271
I just want to do the best I can

00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:10.972
with every task at hand.

00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:12.892
Also,

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:15.271
after helping Aunt
secure that project last time,

00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:16.132
I discovered

00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:18.811
that I enjoy the feeling of winning.

00:30:21.531 --> 00:30:22.732
I noticed that ages ago.

00:30:23.172 --> 00:30:24.051
When?

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:26.031
Back at Changbai Mountains skiing.

00:30:27.932 --> 00:30:29.732
You had only been learning for two days

00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:30.816
but were in a hurry

00:30:30.816 --> 00:30:32.096
to run off and practice alone.

00:30:32.432 --> 00:30:34.311
You tried to secretly
become a master skier

00:30:34.492 --> 00:30:35.412
without me.

00:30:35.972 --> 00:30:36.912
That counts?

00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:38.152
Of course it does.

00:30:38.831 --> 00:30:40.172
We see the big in the small.

00:30:42.952 --> 00:30:43.452

Meeting in the cafeteria.

00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:49.732
Once we

00:30:49.888 --> 00:30:51.104
get through this busy period,

00:30:51.104 --> 00:30:52.448
I'll slack off for half a month.

00:30:52.448 --> 00:30:53.031
No,

00:30:53.472 --> 00:30:54.152
a whole month.

00:30:55.972 --> 00:30:56.652
How?

00:30:57.071 --> 00:30:58.331
By using up all my accumulated

00:30:58.432 --> 00:30:59.071

reading novels, and watching dramas.

00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:05.251
With me?

00:31:06.071 --> 00:31:06.851
Absolutely.

00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:08.932
When I'm lying down watching TV,

00:31:09.091 --> 00:31:10.892
I need someone to bring me snacks.

00:31:13.212 --> 00:31:15.172
I'd rather be your pillow.

00:31:16.531 --> 00:31:18.331
A pillow that fetches snacks?

00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:19.851
