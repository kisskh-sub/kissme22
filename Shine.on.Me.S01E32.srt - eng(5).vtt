[Episode 32]

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.979
Wow, there's more today.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.039
Mr. Lin has been ordering us

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.500
snacks and milk tea
for three days straight.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:44.580
Is there

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.280
some kind of special occasion?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.420
I guess so.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.880
Today it's red bean cake

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.420
and red bean milk tea.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.920
Yesterday was red bean soup
with dried tangerine peel.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.160
Xiguang,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.160
is your boyfriend

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.920
obsessed with red beans?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.000
I have no idea.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.580
Maybe his family had
a massive red bean harvest.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.060
Let me ask him.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.680
Hello there,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.000
our generous Mr. Lin.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.860
When exactly are we heading to Nanjing?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.940
Thanks.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.100
Take a seat.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.620
It's been a long trip.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.320
It's fine.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.860
The drive from Suzhou to Nanjing
doesn't take long.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.200
- Here are the documents.
- Thanks.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.740
Wang asked me to come along too.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.060
That's right. Take a look.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.220
We could use some feedback.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.660
Alright.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.380
Come on, have a seat.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.079
Let's get started.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:45.600
Sure.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.579
This is the result

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.480
of integrating

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.960
the PV system

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.160
into our original design.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.320
The PV modules

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.540
are mainly installed on the roof

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.260
and the side elevations.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.900
On the sides,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.300
they function as sunshades.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.520
Take a look

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.480
and give us your thoughts.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.560
I think there might be an issue here.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.640
If the spacing between the modules

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.860
on the lower part
of the building is off,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.020
it could cause

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.720
localized shadows

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.260
when the light shifts.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.340
Those shaded areas

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.780
won't just stop working.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.300
They'll actually consume power

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.860
from other cells and turn it into heat.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.560
This leads to localized overheating,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.660
triggering the "hot spot effect,"

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.240
which degrades the performance

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.060
and lifespan of the PV modules.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.220
While we can use

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220
bypass diodes

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.880
to mitigate the effect,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.980
the risk

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.680
is still quite high.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.160
I see.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.840
I thought our communication

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.720
was thorough enough,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.440
but I didn't expect

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.740
this kind of problem to pop up.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.100
We'll have to keep refining it.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.079
Should we just remove

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.780
the PV modules from the lower section?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.420
But if we do that,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.480
the total power output

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.420
will take a huge hit.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.940
No rush.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.640
We still have time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.320
Have a seat.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.240
Xiguang,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.779
did you have something

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.019
on your mind earlier?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.520
I wanted to ask

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.700
if we're strictly limited to adding

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.840
PV to the original design.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.120
Is it possible

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.000
to make some small adjustments

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.060
to the design itself?

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.460
What kind of adjustments?

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.260
Let's hear it.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.260
How about turning the podium

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.100
into a wave design?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.540
Waves?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.720
I don't know much about architecture.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.640
I'm just thinking out loud.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.460
I mean,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.120
the main building
keeps the sail imagery.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.800
But the part that was the hull

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.260
expands outward

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.600
in layers of curves,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.360
like waves.

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.340
The PV panels would be spread out
like scales.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.440
When the sun hits them,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.000
it would look like sunlight
shimmering on the sea.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.940
This would increase

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.300
the total surface area
for the PV modules.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.160
Plus, a wave design

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.100
makes it easier for us

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.440
to adjust the installation angle

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.300
to the optimal tilt for Suzhou.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.300
Humanity's pursuit of technology

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.240
and the future

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.040
is like a small sailboat

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.100
on a vast,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.720
directionless ocean.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.800
Aunt, you said

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.100
Chengrui's concept

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.860
was "Setting Sail
and Braving the Waves."

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.580
Before, it was just the "sail."

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.820
With this change,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.060
we actually include the "waves" part.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.480
It ties the whole theme
together perfectly.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.380
Yes.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.760
I can see it now.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.780
But

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.860
why didn't you bring this up
during the meeting?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.940
Well, I don't know Mr. Wang

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.000
that well.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.300
If he felt I was overstepping my bounds,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.320
it would have been awkward.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.180
Not at all.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.240
Wang is very straightforward

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.659
and doesn't care

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.060
about social pleasantries.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.880
Still, Xiguang,

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.380
you're so worldly

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.240
and such a natural with people.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.040
I wouldn't call it being worldly.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.780
She's just considerate

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.000
and she always tries to see things

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.700
from other people's perspectives.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.600
Isn't that exactly
what being worldly means?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.880
Still,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.560
you don't have to be that considerate

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.500
all the time.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.200
It's

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600
a bit unfair to yourself.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.760
I won't.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.000
I'm no fool.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.680
Fair enough.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.320
I'll

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.700
pass your suggestions along

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.440
to Mr. Wang.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.040
Okay.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.800
Uncle, Aunt,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.140
Yusen and I are heading back to Suzhou.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.920
Alright.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.080
I'll see you out.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.620
Okay.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.480
Let's go.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.040
Let's go.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.140
I didn't realize you had

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.360
a talent for architecture, Xiguang.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.340
Oh, stop it.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.760
Don't overpraise me.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.500
Anyone can give an opinion

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.880
or have a moment of inspiration.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.880
Turning it into an actual design

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.020
on paper

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.320
requires real vision

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.300
and a solid foundation

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.520
from the designers.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.920
Everyone knows that.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.060
But

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.580
can't I just praise my own girlfriend

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.140
in private?

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.480
Fine.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.360
Your girlfriend
was being a bit of a killjoy.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.280
How about she treats you to dinner

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.740
as an apology?

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.840
How about

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.080
iron pot stews?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.560
What a coincidence.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.960
That's exactly what your boyfriend
was craving.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.800
[Mr. Hua]

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.100
Nie, I almost forgot.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.020
You and Mr. Lin
are going to Nanjing today,

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.380
right?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.100
I've designed

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.180
a few PV gadgets.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.080
Show them to the designers.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.120
Maybe they can use them

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.880
as accents
for the Intelligent Digital Center.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
We just left.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.820
I'll send them over.

I was so excited I barely slept a wink.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.000
How did she

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.440
suddenly end up with a boyfriend?

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.240
I wonder what he looks like.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.460
Yesterday you were going on and on

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.640
about how he just needs
to be a decent guy.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.440
Today, all you care about is his looks.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.840
Why are you being so annoying?

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.480
Don't think you're getting a free pass

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.480
just because you're feeling dizzy.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.240
Fine.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.340
A car's coming.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.960
It has out-of-town plates.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.980
It's definitely them.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.160
Grandma.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.720
Guang.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.460
Grandpa.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.320
Grandpa.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.860
Guang.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.780
Have you two been waiting in the yard
this whole time?

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.420
I just got here.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.000
Your grandpa's been waiting
since early this morning.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.140
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.900
this is my boyfriend, Lin Yusen.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:12.760
This is my grandpa and grandma.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.579
Hello.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.640
Hello, Lin.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:16.660
Hello.

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:19.720
Thank you, Grandma.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.260
Grandpa,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.060
are you still feeling dizzy today?

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.240
Yusen used to be

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.319
a neurosurgeon.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:26.260
Let him take a look at you.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.420
No need.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.300
What's wrong?

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.240
What's going on?

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.660
You've been dizzy for days.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.500
Do we need to go to the hospital

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.340
for a CT scan?

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.100
Grandpa,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.680
look me in the eyes.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.580
It's okay, I'm fine now.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.740
I just can't move
my head around too much

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.900
or keep shifting positions.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.480
The moment I move, everything spins.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.680
Let's go inside and sit down.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.460
I'll give Grandpa

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.300
a quick check-up.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.520
Okay,

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.340
come on in.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.700
Alright.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.680
Come on.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.680
Easy.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.580
- Careful.
- Okay.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.840
Take it slow.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.140
Keep your head still.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.240
Follow my finger with your eyes.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.380
Look left.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.180
Look right.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.020
Look up.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.620
Look down.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.400
Grandpa,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.980
does the dizziness

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:23.920
get worse

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.080
when you turn your head to the left

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.240
or roll onto your left side?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.120
How did you know?

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.000
I can see it in your eye movements.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.960
Does Grandpa have
any underlying conditions?

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.720
Any issues with his neck?

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.860
His neck is fine.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.320
His blood pressure is a bit high,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.860
but he's been taking his meds

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.800
and it's well under control.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.140
Based on his symptoms,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.660
it looks like BPPV.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.940
I'll do a few more tests

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.720
to figure out

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:44.900
exactly which ear crystal
is out of place.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.820
You might get a bit dizzy

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.540
during the exam.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.680
That's fine.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.880
I'm used to it by now.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.860
As long as you figure out what's wrong.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.720
First, sit up.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.060
Alright.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.300
Come.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.300
At this angle,

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.480
does it feel like the room is spinning?

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.160
Not really.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:06.640
Okay.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.240
It's spinning.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.180
This is the worst.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.420
The whole house
feels like it's flipping over.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:22.700
Come on.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.320
It seems like a displaced crystal

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.720
in the left posterior canal.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.340
What does that even mean?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.280
I've never heard of that.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.300
Ear crystals falling out of place?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.540
Me, neither.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:33.220
Don't worry.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.240
It's not a big deal.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:35.760
Think of ear crystals

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.000
as tiny stones

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.360
in your ear.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.300
When they shift,

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.360
they can make you feel dizzy

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.360
and lose your balance.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.860
Let's try a repositioning maneuver
here at home.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.920
If that doesn't work,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:44.660
we'll head to the hospital.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:45.740
Grandpa,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.100
just follow my lead

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:47.940
and don't fight the movement.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:48.840
Okay.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:50.700
There we go.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.060
Lie down.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.740
Here.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:07.480
Come on.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.320
Are you

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.200
still feeling dizzy?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:20.520
It stopped.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.480
So fast.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.520
That's incredible.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.120
The fix for BPPV

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.000
is usually instant.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.260
But Grandpa,
you shouldn't have just ignored it.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.380
If you let it drag on,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.720
it's just going to keep coming back.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:31.340
That's not good for you.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.660
Exactly, Grandpa.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.260
If you'd gone to the hospital sooner

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.180
to get this fixed,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:36.820
you wouldn't have had to

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.760
suffer so much.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.320
Will it come back?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.120
It might.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.780
So Grandpa,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.880
get plenty of rest,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.540
but try to stay active.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.180
Try to stay calm
and don't get worked up.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.820
If it happens again,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.980
give us a call

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:48.940
or

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.080
just go straight to the hospital.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.800
He won't go.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.040
The bank gave us a free check-up,

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.540
and the results came back.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.840
They even brought in

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.080
doctors from the city

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.920
to walk us through the report,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.420
but he still wouldn't go.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.080
It's nothing serious.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.120
Why drag myself all the way
to the city for that?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.340
Then the check-up
would be a total waste.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.540
That won't do.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.500
Get

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.400
the report out

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:10.880
and let me have a look.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.000
Can you even read that?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.960
He can.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.940
Grandma, your blood vessels
are getting a bit stiff,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.880
and your total cholesterol
is a little on the high side.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.960
Your LDL is slightly elevated too.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.720
Nothing serious.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.060
I'll write down

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.780
some dietary tips for you.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.940
I won't be able to read them.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.160
Times were tough when I was a kid,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.660
so I never went to school.
I can't read.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:45.820
In that case,

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.000
Xiguang and I

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.840
will record a video for you.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.020
That's a great idea.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:49.920
Nice.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.900
Should you be on camera, or should I?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.500
Let Lin do it.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.200
Grandma.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:21:59.820
Well,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.060
Lin is a doctor,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.680
so he's the professional here.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.660
She just wants

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.100
to show off to her friends
back in the village

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.320
when they're playing mahjong.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.120
Lin, check out mine.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.740
Come on, look at Grandpa's report.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:21.900
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.920
you're both in great shape.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.320
Grandpa is all clear, too.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.280
Just take your meds on time

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.300
and get regular check-ups.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.220
See? I told you.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.400
It's so good to have a doctor
in our family.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.320
Now we can finally breathe
a sigh of relief.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.180
Lin,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.460
thanks for all your help today.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.440
Just stay put

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.600
while I get dinner started.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.260
I'll help you out.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:41.600
Grandpa,

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.760
you should get some rest.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.040
Since we just fixed your ear,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:44.820
we don't want it shifting again.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.140
Avoid overexerting yourself
or any sudden movements

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:47.940
for the next couple of days.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.340
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.460
Grandpa, why don't you
find a show to watch?

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:52.440
Okay.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:52.840
Here you go.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.560
I'll go help Grandma.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.380
Come on, let's go get the fire started.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.580
Have you ever even seen

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.280
a wood stove before?

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.460
Only on TV

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:11.700
and at those rural retreats.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.180
Spoken like a true city boy.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.640
Aren't you?

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.260
I

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.240
grew up

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:19.800
at my grandparents' house.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:20.960
I didn't move back to Wuxi

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.880
until I started elementary school.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.120
Starting fires, feeding chickens,
herding geese.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.060
I can do it all.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:27.640
Let me show you how to start the fire.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.540
First,

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.700
clear out the ash from the firebox.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.280
There.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.740
Now,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.360
grab me some straw bundles.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:43.280
Give them here.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:44.740
You light it.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.080
There we go, that's enough.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.020
Now,

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.660
add some bean stalks.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.540
Yeah, those ones.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.400
Put them in like this.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.040
And the firewood.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.740
You have to stack it this way.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.600
You need gaps in the middle

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:09.900
for the fire to catch.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.740
See?

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:11.900
Like this.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:16.540
Done.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.140
Grandma, the fire's going.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.220
I think

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.680
I've got the hang of it.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.240
Here,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.360
hand me the tongs.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.580
I'm taking a photo

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.700
to send to Ms. Sheng.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.960
I'll tell her

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.780
you're stuck here doing chores

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.420
at my grandma's.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.880
She'll need

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.000
to send chocolate to bail you out.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:04.820
Then

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.260
that'll be at least five jin of it.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.840
I'm worth at least that much.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.520
That's a bit steep, don't you think?

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.700
What if Ms. Sheng wakes up,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.720
sees the message,

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.280
and says she can't afford it?

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.220
Then I guess

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.440
I'll just have to stay here

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.400
and tend the fire
for the rest of my life.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.700
Works for me.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.240
Not here.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.520
Your face is so red from the heat.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440
I just wanted to check your temperature.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.780
Is it hot?

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.840
Get back behind me.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.020
Let me feel the heat too.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.980
Guang, Lin,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:39.780
look.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.540
The rice crust turned out perfect today.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.200
You're amazing, Grandma.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.060
It's because you two
did such a great job with the fire.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.120
Take the dishes out.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.080
Lunch is ready.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.220
Come here.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:04.820
Here you go.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.800
Thank you.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.180
Thank you.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.940
You have to try
this wild crucian carp soup.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.440
It's so fresh.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.820
The stuff from the supermarket

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.840
doesn't even come close.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.160
This really is the best I've ever had.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.020
I didn't add anything to it.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.140
It's all natural.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.080
And try

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.780
these sweet and sour ribs.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.580
They're Grandma's specialty.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.500
Dig in.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.160
Delicious.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.520
She actually learned

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.020
how to make these from me.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.960
Since I was too dizzy to cook today,

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.580
next time we'll each do half the dishes

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.260
and have a cook-off.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.080
You're on.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.320
That sounds great.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.760
Once you guys have Yusen

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.340
as a judge,

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.840
you can finally get off my back.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.500
It sounds like

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:04.740
you've been the judge for a long time.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.660
Grandpa and Grandma
are both such good cooks?

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:08.920
Of course.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.340
Back in the day,

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.280
having weddings at hotels

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.320
wasn't a thing.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.760
Whenever there was a celebration
in the village,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.160
everyone would ask them
to be the head chefs.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840
I'd just tag along and feast for free.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.580
Too bad I don't have
that kind of talent.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.360
Even if I use
the same ingredients and steps,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:22.920
it never

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.040
tastes the same.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.040
Maybe next time I'll give it a go.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.060
No more messing with the fire for me.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.860
I'm moving up

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:32.900
to head chef.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.420
I can't let Grandpa and Grandma's skills

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.760
be lost to time.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.640
Alright.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.300
I'll teach you everything.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.220
- Yes.
- Definitely.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.480
Now, eat up.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.180
Come on. Dig in.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.140
Hold on, I need to take this.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:49.040
Hello?

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.240
Xiuzhen,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.120
I can't make it to mahjong today.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.380
Yeah,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.480
Guang is back.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.620
And her boyfriend is here too.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.300
Yeah, they just started dating.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.940
He's tall

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.160
and so handsome.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.880
Plus, he's an amazing doctor.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.060
Let me tell you,

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.220
my husband

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.340
had been feeling dizzy lately

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.760
and he fixed him up
in just a few minutes.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.380
Why would I lie to you?

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.080
He even sat down

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.140
with our check-up reports

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.940
and broke everything down

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.100
for us,

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.280
point by point.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.920
For real?

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.480
Could he take a look at mine?

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.560
I just had a check-up too.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.880
Wu took me.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.380
But after I got the report,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.320
no one told me

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.300
what it actually meant.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.980
Well,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.440
I don't know

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.700
when they're leaving.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.060
Guang,

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.600
Grandaunt Xiuzhen is asking

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.560
if Lin could help

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.080
look at her report.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.740
I guess I talked too much.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.040
Sure thing.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.240
We aren't leaving until tonight anyway.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.060
Grandaunt Xiuzhen has

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.660
the best mulberries.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.840
Tell her to bring some over for me.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.040
Okay.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.680
Xiuzhen,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.540
they aren't leaving until after dinner.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.260
Bring your report over.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.020
Yeah.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.780
And...

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.160
You sold me out like that?

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:07.000
Guang wants some of your mulberries.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.800
Mulberries are expensive, you know.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.020
A basket costs a fortune.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.580
I'll go pick some

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.020
and bring them over right away.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.400
You didn't charge much

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.400
for a visit, did you?

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:14.440
How much?

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.840
That's way too much.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.780
A standard visit

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:17.920
was 14 yuan.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.620
Alright.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.000
Fourteen yuan.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.820
That's a win.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.100
You'll even have change left over.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:23.820
Alright.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.980
It's nothing serious.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.820
Lin, do you know how to read pulses?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.140
I don't know how to do that.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.600
Grandaunt,

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.220
I was trained in Western medicine.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.260
Well, you'll have to work harder

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:47.840
to master both Chinese
and Western medicine.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.440
That's a new one.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.140
I'll look into it when I get back.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.580
Why are there so many people?

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.200
I just ran into them on the road

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.460
and chatted for a bit.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.480
I didn't expect them all

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.340
to follow me once they heard

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.080
your granddaughter's boyfriend

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.140
is a doctor

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.140
who can explain the reports.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.140
They even brought some veggies
from their own fields.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.580
I have plenty of my own, though.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.300
The village organized

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.220
check-ups

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.560
for everyone over 70

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.300
last month.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.980
But a lot of people

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.580
couldn't understand the results.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.900
So they wanted to come by

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.620
and get some answers.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.140
Don't invite anyone else.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.080
I promise,

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.360
no more.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.600
I've been taking my meds,

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.360
but my blood sugar still won't go down.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.580
I wanted to ask

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.480
how I should be taking them.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.280
What are you taking right now?

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.780
Let me show you.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.600
Just these two.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.440
[Gliclazide Tablets]
Diabetes.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.270
[Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets]
I'll have to consult

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:52.540
with another doctor.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.140
Granduncle, just a moment.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.640
Is the doctor you're asking reliable?

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.240
Which hospital are they from?

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.060
Very reliable.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.340
He's the vice chair

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.480
of endocrinology at Huashan Hospital.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:11.440
Huashan?

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:12.940
Where's that?

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.960
It's not just some city hospital.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.140
Granduncle,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.220
you've seen "The Legend
of the Condor Heroes," right?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.320
They have
the "Sword Duel on Mount Huashan."

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.480
I have.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:26.920
I've seen it many times.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.320
Eastern Heretic,Western Venom.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.100
What else was there?

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.140
The five masters,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:33.720
vying for the number one in the world.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.780
Exactly.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:36.980
So, anything with the name "Huashan"

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.080
is top-tier.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.180
It's a major hospital in Shanghai.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:40.880
I see.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.000
That'll do.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.380
What?

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:45.440
Nothing.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.580
Have one.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.720
You don't need to get your hands messy.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:01.760
Hi, Dr. Chen.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:03.240
Sorry to bother you.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.580
I have a family friend here,

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.420
72 years old,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.160
with a 25-year history of diabetes.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.880
Why are more people coming?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.340
I didn't tell anyone else.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.120
It wasn't me.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.280
I'll go check.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.380
Okay.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.400
Got it.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.540
I've got it down.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.220
Thanks, Dr. Chen.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.260
What do you think you're doing?

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.720
We're looking for Nie Chengyuan

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.300
to collect a debt.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.580
Don't be a coward!

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:30.780
Where is he?

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:31.380
Tell him to get out.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:31.740
Stay back.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:32.340
Nie Chengyuan!

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.680
Aren't those

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.820
the Wu brothers?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.280
They're always hanging around
with Qian Dashun.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.620
What are they doing here today?

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.360
At first,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.680
I thought it was just Li.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.040
I never expected them

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.320
to just barge right in

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.260
the second I opened the door.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.320
Qin,

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.360
I'm sorry,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.800
but I really had no choice.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.460
Who are you?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:53.800
What are you doing here?

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.500
So, you're

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.820
Nie Chengyuan's daughter?

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:09.620
Look,

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.860
your dad owes us money,

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.060
and we're here to collect.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.219
Nonsense.

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.440
How could Chengyuan possibly

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.620
owe you money?

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.219
Don't you come in here

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.260
talking trash.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.000
Ma'am,

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.500
I have proof.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:22.780
Look,

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:23.860
here's the IOU.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.320
See for yourselves
if you don't believe me.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.080
[Borrower: Qian Dashun]
[Guarantor: Nie Chengyuan]

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.020
Lin,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.580
what does it say?

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:39.639
Read it to me, quick.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.980
Hereby received from Wu Ergun
an investment

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.860
of 350,000 yuan

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:46.199
for the Yuancheng Group

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:46.900
real estate project,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.080
with a three-month term

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.159
and a monthly interest rate of 2%,

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:50.080
guaranteed

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.659
by Nie Chengyuan.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.040
It says it

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.020
right there.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.340
Qian Dashun is the one
who took the money.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.520
Why are you coming after my dad

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.440
instead of him?

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.020
And besides,

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.360
just because his name
is down as a guarantor

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.380
doesn't make it true.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.560
This isn't

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.800
even my dad's handwriting.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:05.780
I don't care

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:06.700
whose handwriting it is.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.500
The paper says he's responsible,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.020
so he has to pay up.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:08.940
What gives?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.720
Qian Dashun is the one
who borrowed from you,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.240
so go deal with him.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:12.880
Why are you here

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.600
making a scene at our house?

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:14.680
It's all one and the same.

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.980
Everyone in this village knows

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.900
Qian Fangping
is hooked up with your son.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.060
It's no secret that your son

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:21.640
and Qian Fangping

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.060
are pretty much an item.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.760
If Qian Dashun

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.540
hadn't sworn
that Mr. Nie was vouching for him,

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.340
nobody would've lent him a thing.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.620
Now look what happened.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.140
That old man got drunk

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.660
and blabbed

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.120
that all the money was gone.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.920
Then he vanished the very next day

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.460
and is not answering his phone,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.140
so we have no choice

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.760
but to come to Mr. Nie.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.760
No matter how you look at it,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.800
this has nothing to do with us.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:43.820
If you're so sure you're right,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.900
go take it up with the police.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.680
Now get out.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.520
- Leave!
- Get out.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.360
Qin,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.320
I'm not here to force Chengyuan to pay.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.440
Please, just have a little heart

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.140
and have Chengyuan help us find him.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.940
I lent them 220,000 yuan.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.120
I gave them

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.180
everything I saved

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:03.980
from a lifetime

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.120
of working the fields.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.760
They've got over 100,000 of mine too.

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.260
That was my money
for my medical treatments.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.640
How could you guys lend anything

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.820
to Qian Dashun?

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.900
Don't you know

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.040
what he's like?

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.780
How could you buy anything
that came out of his mouth?

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:18.900
I heard

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:21.420
Chengyuan was his guarantor.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:22.940
We've been neighbors forever,

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.340
so I figured

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.500
he wouldn't just disappear.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:26.860
I just wanted

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.960
to make a little interest.

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.160
My note

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.640
only promised 1%,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.400
while theirs were all 2%.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.020
I never thought Qian Dashun

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.820
would actually run off.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.180
Guang,

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.580
call your dad.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.240
Tell him to get back

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.520
and deal with his own mess.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.040
Dear,

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:55.860
what's wrong?

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.700
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:58.860
I'm fine.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:36:59.840
Grandma,

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.300
why don't you take Grandpa
back to his room?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:01.660
Alright,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.680
but what about all this?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.060
Xiguang and I will take care of it.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.660
Don't worry.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.200
Thank you,

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.620
Lin.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.200
Let's go.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.360
Sheng Bokai

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.860
is obsessed with fast-tracking
his son's career,

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.600
and he expects us
to do all the heavy lifting.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.020
He really hasn't thought this through.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.360
An opportunity

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.740
like Intelligent Digital Center project,

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.380
right here in Jiangsu,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.860
is way too big of a deal for me
to just let it go.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.900
Exactly.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.300
He expects us

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.160
to just pave the way for them?

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.260
He's clearly

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.360
overestimating himself.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:33.880
With Yuancheng's reputation

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.000
here in Jiangsu,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.600
even if they bring in Durand,

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.440
they still won't be able
to compete with us.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:40.480
Still, we can't get complacent.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.720
The current proposal

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.840
still needs a bit of polishing.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:43.420
Got it.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.660
Xiguang,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.580
why are you calling me today?

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:55.640
I'll be there right away.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.400
My dad is on his way back from the city.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.620
You guys

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.680
should wait outside.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.120
Wait a second.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.860
Why should we have to

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:02.700
wait outside?

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.460
What,

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.680
is your yard made of gold or something?

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:06.740
We can't even stand here?

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.820
If you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.460
Go ahead.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:09.980
Who are you trying to bluff?

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:10.900
You think they're gonna lock us up?

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.140
Besides,

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.160
I'm not scared of getting hauled in.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.660
It wouldn't be my first time anyway,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.320
right?

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.600
We really should call the police.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.280
Whether someone
gets arrested is one thing,

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.200
but every debt

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.240
has its debtor.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.500
The one who owes you is Qian Dashun.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:28.860
Once the police are here,

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.340
we can get this all cleared up.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:33.960
Fine.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.380
We'll be right outside

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.460
waiting for Mr. Nie.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.300
If he doesn't show up,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.420
we aren't budging.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.440
I'm so sorry about this.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.440
You guys

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.920
should head home.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:01.940
It's a mess here,

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.960
and I don't want
any of you getting hurt.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.100
We're staying right here

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.680
with you.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:06.480
It's okay.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.440
I'm going to lock the gate.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.320
I won't be opening it again

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.360
until my dad gets back.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.860
We'd better head out.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:13.680
Okay.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:15.120
Guang,

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.100
if anything goes sideways,

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.400
just give us a shout.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.160
My son's home today
if you need an extra hand.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:20.780
It's fine.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.420
We're heading out.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.080
Okay, get home safe.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:24.580
Dr. Lin,

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.060
those two

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.540
who were making the biggest scene

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.160
are the worst troublemakers
in the village.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.280
We don't

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.160
even talk to them.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.160
Integrity just runs in the Nie family.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.920
Old Nie and Qin

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.480
are the most honest,

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.820
decent people you'll ever meet.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.680
Everyone in the village has nothing

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.980
but good things to say about them.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.120
They're really well-respected
around here.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.260
Grandaunt Xiuzhen,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.540
I know.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.360
I can tell

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:52.460
just by looking at Xiguang.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.080
Alright, I'm off.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.380
Be careful.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.220
Don't worry.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:19.940
Let's go.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.200
Listen up.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.740
Nie Chengyuan's daughter

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:28.820
and her boyfriend are both here.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.500
This is a rare chance.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.100
Even if it's just to save face

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.680
in front of his future son-in-law,

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.860
he'll have to pay up.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.040
Usually,

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.400
it's just his parents at home,

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:41.680
which makes it hard to get our money.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.780
What if

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.700
they fake a faint

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.920
just to frame us?

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.320
Yeah.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.660
Right?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.280
We're camping out right here

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.560
and we can't let them slip away.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:50.740
Are we gonna

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:51.960
scare off

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.700
the girl's boyfriend?

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:54.620
Yeah,

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.280
maybe we shouldn't have blabbed

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.580
about all the mess

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.900
her dad got into.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.520
Your life savings are gone,

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.840
and you're worried

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.140
about her boyfriend?

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.080
If we weren't leading the way,

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:07.900
you wouldn't get

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.320
a single penny back in your lifetime!

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.460
But Qian is the one
who actually owes us the money.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.220
It's all the same.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.480
You think Nie Chengyuan

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.680
is any better?

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.460
Don't worry.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.660
I just finished
the repositioning maneuver for Grandpa.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.800
He'll be fine after he gets some sleep.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.040
Don't be scared.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.540
It's nothing serious.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.040
I'm not scared.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.080
I'm just so fed up with all this.
