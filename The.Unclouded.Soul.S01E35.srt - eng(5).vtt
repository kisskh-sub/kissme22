[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 35]

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.530
You're done?

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.280
Done.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.360
Wait a moment.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.840
Try it.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.660
Be careful, it's hot.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.120
How is it?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.310
So delicious.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.030
When I return, I must

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.190
spread this recipe

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.730
so humans everywhere can enjoy noodles.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.480
So, noodles were invented by
Hong Ye and me?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.120
You should eat too.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.240
Okay!

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.610
Everyone, come quickly!

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.000
There are pearls everywhere!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.120
Where? Where?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.190
Where are the pearls?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.310
Hurry up and come over!

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.870
Coming! Coming!

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.880
I'm coming!

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.060
Come quickly!

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.480
Thank you for the ingredients.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.500
These pearls

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760
are my gift of gratitude to the village.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.480
Dragon Lord,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.560
we have searched everywhere at sea,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.870
but there are only scattered islands

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.560
with nothing special about them.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.950
I haven't seen any springs
on any of the islands.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.950
I really don't know
where this celestial mountain is.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.159
Since it's a celestial mountain,

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.600
it won't be easy to find.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.120
I'll ask other clans later

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.720
if they have any other clues.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.950
Okay.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.920
Dragon Lord.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.510
The Qiong Qi leader is outside.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.120
He says he has something for you.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.050
Qiong Qi is here?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.750
Yes.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.840
Perfect.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.510
I'll ask Qiong Qi if he has any ideas.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.440
Wait for me here.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.920
Qiong Qi!

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.360
Xiao Yao.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.070
I'm sorry.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.270
I was delayed for a few days

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.730
and missed your birthday.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.310
But...

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.240
You'll definitely like

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.300
the gift this time.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.600
What weapon is it this time?

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.880
It's not a weapon.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.990
Little ones,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.360
you existed in this world

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.070
ten thousand years ago?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.040
I've searched high and low for so long.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.370
I can't believe it's still
something you're familiar with.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.460
Familiar they may be,

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.590
but I haven't seen them for a long time.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.170
Thank you.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.560
I really like this gift.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.710
Glad you like it.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.680
At...

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.390
At least my efforts

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.010
weren't in vain.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.920
Come.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.510
Don't be afraid.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.040
I will protect you well.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.510
Cultivation is not easy.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.930
You must hide well.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.990
If other tribes find you,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.370
you won't be so lucky.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.720
Where did you find them?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.900
Mount Zhaoyao.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.170
Take them back.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.880
I thought you liked them.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.390
Wouldn't it be nice to have them
keep you company in the Dragon Palace?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.630
They prefer cold and dark places,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.830
and thrive in groves.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.070
Living underwater

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.000
isn't good for their cultivation.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.960
Thank you for your kindness.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.170
I'll go with you

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.830
to find them a safe place.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.360
Excellent.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.020
Excellent.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.040
These creatures are too small.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.790
I'm too rough,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.470
so I need you to come with.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.370
How did you get injured like this?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.040
On a deserted island,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.160
I startled a pair of love birds.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.120
They chased and attacked me,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.380
and this is the result.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.960
However,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.370
they're not much better off than I am.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.270
Quickly, go ask the Dragon Lord
for ambergris.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.930
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.750
The Dragon Lord asked you
to find the celestial mountain,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.310
not to create one yourself.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.940
Why push yourself so hard?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.110
I must obey

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.560
the Dragon Lord's orders.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.390
Since I've heard them,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.790
I must fulfill them well.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.120
Yes, yes.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.040
Long Zhi,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.310
be gentle.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.510
That's what you get
for overestimating yourself.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.630
Let me try.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.560
The Dragon Lord sent you?

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.560
I heard you were looking for ambergris.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.040
I guessed you were injured,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040
so I brought some.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.270
Since you were injured while searching for
the celestial mountain,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.120
allow me

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.020
to offer my humble assistance.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.060
Your technique in applying medicine
is quite good.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.130
Perhaps because I've been injured
too many times.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.920
You dared to attack the Dragon Lord twice.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.550
Only hurting you is light punishment.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.080
Besides,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.870
our search for the celestial mountain

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.930
is also by the Dragon Lord's command.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.670
It has nothing to do with you.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.470
I understand.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.090
I was foolish before.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.120
After spending time with the Dragon Lord,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.840
I finally realized
the Dragon Lord's intentions toward me.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.330
So,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.720
you've only heard of the Yuli Spring

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.440
on the celestial mountain.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.150
You've never seen it, right?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.680
That is a divine gift

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.050
bestowed upon humans.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.270
Humans who drink it
can achieve immortality.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.320
If demons drink it,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.450
their power can greatly increase too.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.030
It can enhance power?

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:31.630
Yes.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.050
How much must one drink

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.460
and how much can it increase one's power?

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.910
That I don't know.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.910
If it were truly effective,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.600
then all demons would stop cultivation

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.150
and just drink this spring water
to become great demons.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.010
They wouldn't need to
undergo tribulation either.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.990
What is tribulation?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.210
Tribulation is when

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.510
after reaching
a certain level of cultivation,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.970
demons must face trials
arranged by heaven.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.210
It's a test

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.550
and also a punishment.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.080
Only by

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.790
surviving the heavenly tribulation

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.650
can one enter
the next higher level of cultivation.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.670
If one fails the tribulation,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.730
at best, their power will be damaged;

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.960
at worst,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.380
their soul will be destroyed.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.440
Is it that serious?

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.360
Yes.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.250
Enough.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.120
If you're so afraid of tribulation,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.550
then just stop cultivating.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.080
Always talking about
tribulation like this,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.780
you'll speak it into reality.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.670
Why is she so angry?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.390
I almost forgot.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.790
Long Zhi

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.900
is approaching her tribulation day.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.270
For many things,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840
you can't avoid them

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.370
just because you fear them,

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.270
nor can you escape from them
simply out of fear.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.400
When you're afraid,

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.200
think about how you must do it,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.790
how you have no choice,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.190
and perhaps
you won't be so afraid anymore.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.240
I'm leaving.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.440
Tell me more

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.700
about the Yuli Spring.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.850
What else

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.840
did heaven

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840
tell you humans?

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.000
Dragon Lord.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.870
You human,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.400
how dare you not kneel
before the Dragon Lord?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.180
Why should he kneel?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.990
I'm going out with Qiong Qi.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.020
Wait for my return.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.350
While I'm gone,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.640
don't cause trouble.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.150
Rest assured, Dragon Lord.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.060
I'm here.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.870
We're about to face tribulation.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.270
How can we care
about such trivial matters?

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.000
Rest assured, Dragon Lord.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.930
After you leave,

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.550
we will protect Hong Ye.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.270
Here.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.670
Keep it safe for me.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:00.800
Remember,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.510
don't let it leave your side.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.440
Mermaid pearls?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.690
Even one mermaid pearl is rare,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.900
yet you gave a whole string to Hong Ye.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Because I want to.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.000
I...

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.150
Alright,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.430
it's about time to leave.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:22.410
Wait for me.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.600
I'll be back soon.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.350
Okay.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.280
Let's go.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.800
That's all I know.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.270
If you have any news about the Yuli Spring
on the celestial mountain,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.400
you must let me know.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.750
If what you say is true

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.380
and the Yuli Spring

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.910
can make humans immortal

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.770
and enhance demons' power,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.360
wouldn't that break the rules
of gradual progression

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.510
for cultivation?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.750
I'm afraid this might not be good

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.950
for humans or demons.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.340
I thought I had caught a lot.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.620
I didn't expect there was
more to discover here.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:26.910
Okay.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.390
Qiong Qi and I

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.100
will help you build a barrier,

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.110
so you won't be disturbed
by the outside world anymore

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.150
and can multiply and thrive on your own.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.240
Are you willing?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.440
During your celestial worship,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.390
didn't you ask

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.850
which direction the celestial mountain is?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.900
The deity must test our sincerity

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.030
before revealing any divine signs.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.480
There are so few clues.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.550
Indeed.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.130
For many years,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.080
humans have performed
celestial worship every month,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.080
but only that one time

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.840
did we receive guidance from the deity.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.770
What is a month?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.910
Humans

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.790
mark the beginning of each day

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.120
by sunrise and moonset.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.030
Thirty days make a month.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.830
Twelve months

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.750
make a year.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.460
So that's how humans calculate time?

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:39.910
Yes.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:42.670
There's more.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.550
A day is divided into
12 shichen.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.510
Within that, there are

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.770
hours, quarters, minutes, and seconds.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.250
Humans are truly meticulous about time.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:52.670
We demons

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.360
only have

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.000
days, years, eras, and millennia.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.790
The differences
between humans and demons

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.720
are everywhere.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
It doesn't matter.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.720
Once we find the Yuli Spring
on the celestial mountain,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.550
won't you humans

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:05.330
be able to measure time like us?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.600
Do you truly want to help humans

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.890
achieve immortality?

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.650
What's wrong with that?

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.600
Nothing.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.800
The Dragon Lord said

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.150
humans are also part of all living beings.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.360
I don't understand what it feels like
to protect all beings,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.440
but whatever the Dragon Lord says

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.240
must be right.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.330
Humans are truly too fragile.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.600
If you could also achieve immortality,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.200
the Dragon Lord would surely be happy.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.550
When the Dragon Lord is happy,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.440
I am happy too.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:40.550
Come.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.090
To immortality.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.080
To immortality.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.960
The Dragon Lord
has shown me great kindness.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.000
If I could truly obtain the Yuli Spring,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.860
I would have a chance to repay her.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.360
Now that I've fully recovered,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.630
I want to return immediately

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.790
to lead humans in celestial worship

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.270
and seek guidance from the deity.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:06.960
Perhaps

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.750
we could gain more information
about the celestial mountain

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.960
and the Yuli Spring.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.790
The Dragon Lord hasn't returned yet.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.000
You cannot leave.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.470
Could you accompany me then?

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:18.270
But...

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.000
If the Dragon Lord blames me later,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.330
you must explain for me.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.470
Of course.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.530
Can the Dragon Lord fly too?

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.300
Of course.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.240
She flies the highest and fastest.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.870
When she gets tired of flying,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.730
she can ride the mystical turtle.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.930
Then why did she just row a boat

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.870
when we went to sea before?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.800
The Dragon Lord

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.460
must have her own reasons.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.660
This way,

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.119
whether humans or demons come here,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.040
they will take another path.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.109
This will be our secret.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.710
Not a single word
can be revealed to others.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:24.750
All right.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.790
From now on,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.450
pretend you never saw them.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.920
Okay.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.090
You don't like that?

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.170
Of course not.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.460
If...

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.880
I mean, if by chance

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.310
you really see the deity again,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.440
remember to help me ask

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.520
if Yuli Spring can enhance power,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.350
can it also help avoid tribulation?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.790
Sure.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.790
Okay.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.750
Shouldn't you have

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.680
experienced tribulation before?

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.050
Why are you so afraid?

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.240
It's different.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.200
The higher your power,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.510
the greater the tribulation.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.830
Last time was already extremely dangerous.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.110
Fortunately, I prayed
before the Dragon Essence Pearl

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.400
for three whole years.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.410
That's why I returned unscathed.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720
Dragon Essence Pearl?

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.590
The Dragon Essence Pearl

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:10.440
is formed from the essence
from prior dragon generations.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.920
Every dragon prays before
the Dragon Essence Pearl

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.530
before facing tribulation.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.300
If they return successfully,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.680
they add their a sliver
of their essence to the Pearl,

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.200
blessing those who come after.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.330
And so it continues,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.370
making our dragon clan stronger.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:23.510
That sounds

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.440
similar to the deity statues of humans.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.790
It's the dragon clan's greatest treasure,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.640
containing thousands of dragon essences.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.340
It has the power to create a new world.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.610
If someone obtained it,

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.480
wouldn't their power
increase tremendously?

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.570
Since it's so precious,

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.970
it's guarded by the most powerful dragons.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.740
Besides,

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.510
the Dragon Lord now has
the power of the Azure Dragon.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.550
Who could possibly take it?

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.030
It's not just the Dragon Essence Pearl.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.030
The vine serpent clan's Mist Pearl,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.590
the Qiong Qi Clan's
Primordial Pearl,

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.720
and other ancestral pearls of major clans

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.310
all contain immense power.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.240
The primordial spirit and beastly nature
within the pearls

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.500
can affect one's mind.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.450
Eventually,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.270
you wouldn't be using the pearl.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.330
The pearl would be using you instead.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:08.240
I'm still young.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.760
It's not my time yet!

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.180
Could I be facing tribulation early?

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.670
I'm not ready!

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.360
Hong Ye!

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.140
What...

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.640
Why are the waves so big?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.700
What's happening?

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.870
What's going on?

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.260
What's happening?

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.730
Who stirred up these waves on the sea?

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:39.790
I don't know.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.520
Where is Long Yu?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.030
The young dragon is playful.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.500
He's probably still playing with Hong Ye.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.830
Come take a look with me.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.210
Dragon Lord!

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.320
Dragon Lord, please save Hong Ye!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.960
What happened to Hong Ye?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.040
I was flying with him
over the sea,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.270
but suddenly,
the sky and sea changed color.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.410
A huge wave
crashed into us amid the lightning.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.750
When I made it through the wave,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.940
Hong Ye was gone.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.550
I searched in the sea for a long time

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.310
but couldn't find him anywhere.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.590
Do...

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.890
Do humans also experience tribulation?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.110
What just happened
was clearly not a tribulation.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.240
It must've been a great demon
casting spells at sea.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.590
Great demons with such power

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.450
are extremely rare in this world.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.440
Dragon Lord.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.240
Any findings?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.640
Continuing to search like this won't work.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.590
Perhaps you

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.680
could borrow

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.110
the Mist Pearl from the vine serpent clan?

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.030
The Mist Pearl?

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:10.640
It's the vine serpents' treasure

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.170
that can show the current state
of any demon you're thinking of.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.720
It works for humans too,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.250
as long as he's still alive.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.040
But Teng She is carefree

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.550
and always hard to locate.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.010
Where would we find him
on such short notice?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.600
Who are you?

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.630
You're not worthy to ask my name.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.160
Humans are inferior.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.720
I heard you're a human prince.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.600
That makes you the lowest of the low.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.140
You should understand

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.970
that if your life is worthless,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.160
yet you obtain what you don't deserve,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.070
death isn't far away.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.070
That is...

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.210
That belongs to the Azure Dragon.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.880
You think using the Azure Dragon's name

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.350
will save your life?

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.680
I gave it to Xiao Yao once,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.530
so I can give it to her again.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.440
As for you?

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.290
The Azure Dragon is noble.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.960
When you stay by her side

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.120
and touch her possessions,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.830
you're defiling her.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.550
You deserve to die.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.030
Turns out...

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.500
It turns out a great demon like you

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.070
also gets afraid.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:50.680
What?

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.520
You fear me.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.070
Come on,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.030
tell me.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.920
What's there to be afraid of?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.690
You're afraid that Xiao Yao

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.020
truly likes

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.350
a human like me.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.880
You're a mere human.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.160
Within less than a century,

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.430
she won't even remember your name.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.590
But no matter when,

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.910
she will always remember

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.510
that you killed me.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.590
If you kill me,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.550
she will hate you forever.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.970
You worthless human!

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.100
You only spent a few days
with the Dragon Lord

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.550
and you're already using her name

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.550
to threaten me.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.550
What a despicable human.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.400
Instead of thinking of how to survive,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.810
you dare to covet what you don't deserve.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.790
Very well.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:30.920
Today,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.720
I'll let your own kind teach you

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.830
how to be a proper human.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.870
Bring them in!

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.240
Hurry up!

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.490
Prince Ye!

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.310
It's Prince Ye!

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.920
Prince Ye, save us!

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.590
Prince Ye,

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.440
save us!

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.410
Prince Ye, help us!

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.750
Please save us!

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.110
How have my people offended you?

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.680
The obsidian from Mount Qingyuan

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.030
means nothing

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.880
to us demons.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.520
But when humans use it,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.360
it generates yang energy

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.640
and opens meridians,

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.720
so humans always take risks to extract it.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.130
You are their prince.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.240
If you want to save their lives,

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:27.720
crawl over there

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.590
and bring the obsidian to my feet
with your mouth.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.990
For each piece you bring,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.200
I'll spare one life.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.630
What's wrong?

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.790
You don't want to?

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.370
You're not speaking.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.140
Prince Ye, please save us!

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.510
Prince Ye, please save us!

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.840
I don't want to die!

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.720
I don't like the look in your eyes.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.790
Stop!

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.600
I'll kneel.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.820
Yao!

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.920
You came just in time.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.380
I was about to look for you.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.130
How did you know
I wanted to borrow the Mist Pearl?

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.750
You've been spying on me.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.750
This is the greatest treasure of my clan.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.400
I can't just use it casually.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.200
I just happened to see

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.720
that you wanted to borrow it from me,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.920
so I brought it to you...

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.830
Fine.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:09.750
I recently heard that

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.950
you've been especially nice
to a human.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.240
I wanted to see what that was all about.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.590
Finding him is priority.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.030
Finding him is priority.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.160
Carefully recall his appearance,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.720
then project it into the Mist Pearl

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.320
and you'll be able to see him.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.040
The stronger your longing,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.930
the clearer you'll see him.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.020
He has...

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.900
obsidian in his mouth?

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.910
Mount Qingyuan is rich in obsidian.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.150
That's where the Ao Hen Clan dwells.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.900
Him?

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.640
I'll go with you!

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.330
Yao,

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.750
it's just a mere human.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.530
Why should you trouble yourself
to save him?

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.540
Rumors are being spread.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.240
And they don't sound good.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.030
They're saying

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.350
that the way you're treating

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:22.880
a human

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.640
is quite unusual.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.270
I said it's impossible.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:27.230
Those humans

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.160
are both despicable

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160
and incompetent.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.410
But what you're doing will certainly

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.640
cause some controversy.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.480
You...

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.880
Why are you glaring at me?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.440
We've known each other
for a thousand years,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.900
yet I've never seen you
care so much about me.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.650
Then suddenly a human appears,

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.720
and you're incredibly concerned about him.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.110
Hong Ye is the one I once told you about
who captured my heart,

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.030
the husband I chose for myself.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.590
Human or demon,

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.350
I don't care what others say.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.480
But if anyone dares to harm Hong Ye,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.610
I will show no mercy.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.160
How long have you known each other?

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.590
How much do you really know about him?

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:01.920
Don't lose your senses.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.550
Teng She.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.280
I've said what needed to be said.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.790
Thank you for lending me the Mist Pearl.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:10.160
I'll save my man myself.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.270
You don't need to follow me anymore.

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.550
Wait.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.310
Who told you to stand up?

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.120
Quite humane indeed.

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.070
Come on!

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.650
Beg your prince

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.120
to save you!

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.790
Speak!

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.400
Don't!

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:57.870
Prince!

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.160
Prince, save us!

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.010
No need.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.030
Prince, save us!

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:05.940
Too slow!

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.480
Wake up.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.110
Wake up.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.110
Wake up.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.160
You've gone too far.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.070
I'll use their lives

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.960
to teach you how to be a proper human.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.940
You're nothing but a servant to dragons.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.620
Know your place.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.750
You can't even save your own life.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.610
You don't deserve anything more,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.730
much less to be
by the Azure Dragon's side.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.960
If you want to live,

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.040
disappear from Xiao Yao's sight.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:16.720
Understand?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.360
Either endure,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.790
or be ruthless.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.800
Only then can you stand firm.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.870
For you humans,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.640
you can only endure.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.590
Originally,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.200
I also felt unworthy of her.

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.930
I didn't dare imagine
any relationship with the Azure Dragon.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.750
I even

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.350
tried to escape my momentary feelings

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.160
and decided to stay away from Xiao Yao,

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.190
which gave you the chance

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.400
to kidnap me,

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.410
humiliate me,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.180
and kill my citizens.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.070
You say

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:01.010
I don't deserve to stand beside Xiao Yao.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.910
My suffering today

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.550
is precisely because you're jealous

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.880
that I now stand by

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.930
the Azure Dragon's side.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.710
She has saved me twice.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.500
For my sake,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.240
she fought against her own kind.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.470
She went to find the Yuli
from the celestial mountain for me.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.280
She even told me...

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.640
I'm her destined husband.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.200
But you...

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.270
You went to great lengths to please her,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.110
giving her mermaid pearls.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.690
But to her,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:44.940
you can be discarded like worn-out shoes.

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.680
How laughable.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.540
You're just a lowly human.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.390
Shut your mouth!

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.790
Though I am a "lowly human" as you say,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.590
I act with integrity.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.550
I'm not treacherous and vicious

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.880
like you.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.960
Although I have no power,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.420
and cannot protect my people,

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:33.090
I am willing to die alongside them.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.960
I will not beg for your mercy,

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:40.260
nor will I, for the sake of survival,

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.700
agree to stay away from Xiao Yao.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.070
Because

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.070
even if I die,

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.870
Xiao Yao will remember me forever.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.090
If you want to kill me,

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.990
do it.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.320
You're seeking death

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.840
to disrupt my mind.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.670
Delusional.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.280
You think too highly of yourself.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.110
Even if Xiao Yao is the Dragon Lord,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:24.909
she cannot control everything.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.750
Since she has the duty
to protect all beings,

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.860
she would never become enemies

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.679
with the Ao Hen Clan for you.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.830
There's also Qiong Qi

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.110
and Teng She.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.840
Do you think they would approve of

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.100
the Azure Dragon being with you?

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.850
And would Xiao Yao, for your sake,

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.760
turn against both of them?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.699
I admit you're somewhat clever.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.730
But since you're seeking death,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.050
I'll do as you say.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.440
Ao Hen!

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.710
Come out!

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.190
Ao Hen,

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:02.560
come out!

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.760
I know you can hear me.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.440
If you dare harm Hong Ye,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.090
I'll make you regret it.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:09.760
Xiao Yao.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.360
Your life

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.760
will be spared a bit longer.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.070
Guard him.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.440
Where's Hong Ye?

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.940
I risked my life to find this treasure.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.390
Why did you give it to a lowly human?

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:45.830
In your eyes,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.960
am I not as good as a human?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.110
What did you do to Hong Ye?

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.640
He won't die that easily.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.360
You truly disappoint me.

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.860
I fell in love with you at first sight,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.350
yet I never dared to reveal my feelings.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.140
Because you are the Azure Dragon.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.320
You're meant to be exalted

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.850
and revered by all spirits.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.250
I feared I wasn't good enough,

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.090
afraid my feelings would disturb you.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.200
I even took every word you said

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.720
as my guiding principle.

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.970
I devoted myself to cultivation,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.690
no longer committing any wrongful deeds.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.590
But I never imagined

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.150
you would treat yourself like this,

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.000
being intimate

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.480
with a human.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.230
Tell me where Hong Ye is.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.570
Hand Hong Ye over to me now!

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.360
What if I refuse?

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.320
Punish me as you wish.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.230
The Ao Hen Clan occupies Mount Qingyuan

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.000
because of

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.920
the obsidian.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.790
Then the place
with the strongest obsidian energy

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.510
must be where
the cave dwelling is located.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.360
A great demon
has broken through the barrier!

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.760
Hurry and inform Master!

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.030
You are

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.670
Hong Ye?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.110
Yes, I am.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.070
Answering so readily.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.510
You think I'm here to rescue you?

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.920
You've also come to kill me.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.090
Is it because of Xiao Yao?

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.720
How dare you mention her?

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.880
For your sake,

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.670
Xiao Yao ignores all the criticism
from demons.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.300
For you,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.480
she's now fighting fiercely with Ao Hen.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.150
For you,

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.350
she's even willing to

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.230
sever ties with me.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.750
I too received a divine revelation.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:48.840
Would you like to know

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.920
what I saw?

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:54.090
I saw what my future husband looks like.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:55.590
You

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.610
are my destined husband.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.900
What's so special about you

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.440
that she can't live without you?

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.110
I only know

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.420
she is someone

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.590
I'll protect for my entire life.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.190
Fine.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:32.670
This

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.440
is the Samadhi Yin Fire.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.580
Don't be afraid.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.170
It won't kill you.

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.300
It will only make you suffer

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.100
the agony of your body and heart burning.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.180
As long as you live,

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.210
I'll make you suffer each day.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.530
Can't bear it anymore, can you?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.820
I knew

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.360
a human like you

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.190
could never make her happy.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.070
But if you promise me

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.690
to never see Xiao Yao again,

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:09.010
I'll let you go.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.440
Speak.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.020
Just say it,

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.210
and you won't have to suffer anymore.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.560
Say it.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.730
Say it!

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:30.070
Speak!

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.490
Why won't you say it?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.230
Promise me you'll never see her again,

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.440
and I'll free you from this pain.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.430
Just say it.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.730
Say it!

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.650
If I can see her again,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.320
this little suffering

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.150
means nothing at all.
