Care for a drink?

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.030
Sure.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.480
Such bright stars tonight.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.479
Tomorrow's weather will surely be great.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.420
I gave you a chance, yet you missed it!

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.710
Cheers! Come on.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.440
Are you okay?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.030
It's a misunderstanding, Mr. Liu.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.230
A misunderstanding?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.290
How audacious of you.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.880
Do you know who he is?

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.110
What about Zhao Peng?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.750
I know him.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.490
This is his son.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.800
Uncle Tianfei, why are you here?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.840
Why am I here?

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.329
I own this place.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.490
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.280
Mr. Zhao,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.240
that was an honest mistake.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.570
Did I allow you to speak?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.700
How did he hit you just now?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.730
Hit him back.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.710
Forget it.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.630
Just a few light hits.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.710
"Forget it"? No way.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.650
Don't be afraid, Wenxuan.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.630
In this place,

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.519
I won't let anyone bully you.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.350
Things are different now.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.810
Nobody can intimidate us.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.990
Hit him back.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.430
Go.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.830
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Zhao,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.750
please hear me out.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.280
That was an honest mistake.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.890
You hit me, didn't you?

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.890
You hit me, right?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.300
How dare you?

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.240
Sir, sir, sir!

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.950
Alright.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:42.780
Stop it.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.830
Enough, Wenxuan.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.760
It's over.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.020
Calm down.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.159
All is fine.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.430
Everyone!

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.670
I have an announcement to make.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.270
Tonight...

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.670
all your expenses

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.160
will be paid by Mr. Zhao!

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.240
Just say you're a journalist

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.040
who's collecting information.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.159
Captain Qin.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.890
Captain Qin.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.390
Someone

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.409
commented the news
about the Hangang Center incident,

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.630
saying that the report is wrong

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.060
and that there was a fatality
at the site.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.010
We meant to ask him for more information,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.210
but he wouldn't talk.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.790
Who?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.330
[Wrong. A death at the construction site.]
[Hello. Can we talk?]

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.210
Go find him.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.540
Ask him what happened

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.270
and why he posted this comment.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.120
Treat him as a rumor monger
if he doesn't tell the truth.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.800
Wen Bo.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.840
There's one more thing.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.300
We found out who smeared us online

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.480
when we arrested Zheng Gao

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.210
previously.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.260
Liu Tianfei hired him.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.860
The middleman was Xu Jiajun.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.140
Uncle Tianfei?

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.200
Got it.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.950
I'll follow up on that.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.400
Continue.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.180
Xin.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.540
Xin,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.370
there you are.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.120
I was just out for a meeting.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.680
Your assistant...

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.070
Named Meng Yu, right?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.380
Why isn't she with you?

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.750
She has resigned.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.910
Shall we go for a ride?

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.830
Please let me take a rest.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.310
I think you have a real talent
for horse riding.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.310
You're even getting better than me.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.690
That's not true.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.880
It all thanks to you
for being a great tutor.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.510
Have you thought about
keeping your own horse?

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.970
I'm still just a beginner.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.950
It's too soon to think about that.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.750
Preparation is not necessarily a must

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.610
before action.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.360
But now,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.820
I have too much going on

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.530
both at home

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.270
and in the company.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.680
There's very little time for myself.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.920
How can I find time
to take care of a horse?

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.800
You can consult your brother
about company affairs.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.000
He and you are family.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.630
Why do everything on your own?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.960
I hate to rely on others,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.480
especially my brother.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.320
Business and family

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.080
had better be separated.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.530
You're just like your brother,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.190
so respectful of boundaries.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.450
If the two of you joined forces,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.530
there might not be a place
for me and Xinrui Group.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.770
You're joking again.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.010
Xin,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.630
how's the Hangang Center incident
being handled?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.280
Everything's fine.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.940
Hasn't your brother told you?

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.770
No. Maybe he's too busy to inform me.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.260
Come on, have some fruit.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.000
Thank you.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.970
What do you think of this

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.400
newly arrived wine?

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.169
It's okay.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.450
It agrees well with me.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.720
But I'm telling you,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.120
everything works for me,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.810
as long as it's alcohol.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.290
It strikes me as a little light-bodied.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.090
Mediocre, I'd say.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.800
I agree.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.720
This wine is beneath us.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.480
Anything wrong, Tianye?

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.650
Baoshuai!

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.000
Mr. Wei forsook his construction business

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.250
for smuggling liquor

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.450
without telling me.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:12.970
Mr. Liu,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.400
I'm so sorry.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.940
I beg for a second chance,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.540
Mr. Liu.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.420
I understand

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.040
that you're eager to make money.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.000
But there are certain types of business

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.050
you can't touch.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.440
Mr. Wei told me that it was you

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.440
who encouraged him to do smuggling,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.730
and that you invested much money in it.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.150
Is that true?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.540
Tianye,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:35.580
I...

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.840
Last month, you spent a fortune

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:38.780
on two watches.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.350
Where did you hide them?

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:46.190
They're...

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.310
in my apartment downtown.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.850
I bought that apartment for Jiangyan.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.470
Jiajun.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.330
Jiangyan

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.510
is my only sister.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.170
I can't just watch you lie to her

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.750
and do nothing.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.080
Tianye,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.530
we're all family here.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.060
Let's talk things through.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.470
I'll take Mr. Wei out now.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.350
Tianye...

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.160
Well, Tianye,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.630
I bet Jiajun knows he has done wrong.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.360
Such seriousness is uncalled for.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.340
I'm sorry, Tianye.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.670
Tianye,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.050
I admit

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.000
I'm in the wrong.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.170
I was just

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.520
desperate to make money

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.720
and to build my own business.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.030
That was why I foolishly...

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.840
Tianye, could you please keep it secret

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.700
from Jiangyan?

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.720
I promise

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.360
there won't be a next time.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.090
"Next time"?

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.520
This is enough, Tianye.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.920
We're all family here.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.940
"Family"?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.600
What kind of family
would do such stupid things?

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.080
Did you two launch that smear campaign

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.680
when Zheng Gao was arrested?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.150
Tianye,

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.190
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:51.720
I...

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:52.910
Was I asking you?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.750
If you dare hide anything

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.550
from me again,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.680
you'll die a painful death.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.590
Get lost.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.250
Tianye,

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.080
I'm to blame

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.280
for this matter.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.530
It's my fault.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.610
I shouldn't have involved Jiajun.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.480
However...

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.710
Tianye,

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.560
I think you're also well aware

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.060
that Feng has been coming after us
frantically for years...

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.050
Shut up.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.800
What was it for when we took

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.340
all that trouble to clean up the mess?

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.470
We only did it to redirect the flak
to Zhang Xin.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.000
Why did you pull that stunt?

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.900
Wouldn't Qin Feng investigate it himself?

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.420
Uncle Tianye, actually...

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.550
I'm partly to blame.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.670
If I hadn't lost the cufflinks

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.340
and...

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.020
Alright, stop it, Baoshuai.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.430
You stay out of this.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.110
It has nothing to do with you.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.400
This is my fault,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.630
entirely.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.700
Tianye,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.750
I've already owned up to it,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.410
alright?

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:59.880
To be honest,

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.100
Feng has been after us

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.940
over these many years.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.540
Right?

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.220
Tell me.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:05.060
What else could I have done?

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.820
We're family.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.420
Would I have possibly hurt him?

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.060
But there had to be
an answer to his actions,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.020
or a solution, right?

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.350
That can't justify what you did!

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.550
Then what do you think I should've done?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.630
Does Feng even take us as his family?

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.270
He's now trying to tear

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.450
the family apart.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.820
Don't you understand?

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.870
-Why don't you let me speak?
-Stop running your mouth.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.700
Go on.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.550
I'm listening.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.550
Tucked right into my pocket.
Tucked right into my pocket.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.510
Back then, how do you think Ma Jin

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.380
and Luo Bo figured out we took the money?

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.980
Would Jiangyong have died
if you had kept your hands to yourself?

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.740
Look what has become

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.410
of you in recent years.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.120
A complete mess
living in a drunken stupor.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:59.680
I know you're upset
about Jiangyong's death.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.620
I'm not blaming you.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.680
We're all responsible for his death.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.460
But Tianfei,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.400
you can't go on in this way.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.960
The family needs you.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.220
Alright.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:19.370
Enough.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.710
Stop it, Tianfei.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.390
Stop it!

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.070
It's time you quit drinking.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.090
Tianye.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.890
Tianye!

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.980
So far, Liu Tianye has only found out

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.710
the business I did with Mr. Wei.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.690
He doesn't know about

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860
our dealings yet.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.580
He got so mad

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.030
over such a minor issue.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.960
They still haven't accepted you.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.050
Those from Longwan
are just a bunch of country bumpkins

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.070
who only trust their relatives.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.740
They're no different
than those heinous landlords

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.870
from centuries ago.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.040
Ms. Zhang.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.700
I'm fed up with staying in Longwan.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.900
I want to work for you.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.410
You're one of Longwan people now.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.540
If they know you've turned to me,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.260
your life will become even more difficult.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.290
One of Longwan people?

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.550
Has any of them ever treated me
as one of Longwan people?

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.820
They all look down on me,

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.500
calling me an outsider
who sponges off his wife.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.190
Every day, I'm like walking on eggshells
around Liu Tianye.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.000
I'm so sick of this pathetic life.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.670
I'll divorce his sister if I have to.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.400
You must not.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.960
Why not?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.950
Once you leave Longwan,

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.040
you'll be of no use.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.390
What do you mean?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.040
Just stay in Longwan.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.050
Perhaps

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.080
I'll need you for something.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.670
All of you are using me as a tool,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.220
right?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.270
Am I a slave to you guys?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:17.470
Ms. Zhang,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.550
haven't I done much work for you
over these years?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.550
You think you've worked for me?

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.500
I just helped you make some money.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.230
Have you forgotten who you are?

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:28.670
Right.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.900
Your business

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.530
is way out of my league.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.320
I'll quit then, okay?

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.220
Do you think you'll get to live

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.460
if Liu Tianye finds out about
the dirty stuff you've been using

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.920
Longwan's companies for?

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.500
Just the money you've laundered already
amounts to dozens of millions, right?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.040
If word gets out,

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.730
your wife and child
will both be implicated.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.970
I get it.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:01.580
You plan to threaten Liu Tianye
with Jiangyan.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.020
What a deliberate scheme of yours.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.750
It turns out
you've been having this evil plan

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.550
in mind
while pretending to be Jiangyan's friend.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.960
Given the line of business I'm in,

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.160
I have to leave myself a way out.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.790
I've heard

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.470
that you're being ousted

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.620
from the Hangzhou Port project.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.520
Xu Jiajun,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.030
just go back to Longwan
and mooch off your wife.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.630
You'd better behave,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.850
or I'll have your whole family

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.620
suffer for what you've done
in these years.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.310
Xu Jiajun!

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.350
What's wrong, honey?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.720
What is this about?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.310
[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau
enforced the law violently]

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.190
Why would this college mate of yours

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.810
write such an article to criticize

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.609
my brother and the police force?

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.040
I asked him about it.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.890
He said he was introduced by you!

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:10.670
Honey,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.390
-sit down and hear me out.
-Don't touch me!

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:13.050
Explain it!

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.790
Oh, please,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:15.920
just hear me out.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.410
It's a misunderstanding.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.220
I was deceived by Tianfei.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.869
He asked me to introduce
someone from the press

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.349
to him, claiming that he was doing

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:23.579
another person a favor.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.380
I didn't ask for more specifics.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.630
Look what a mess it has become.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.390
It's my fault for being too thoughtless.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.700
Who would've known he'd do such a thing?

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:32.900
If I had realized it,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.570
I wouldn't have introduced anyone to him.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.770
Why didn't you tell me

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.730
the whole story earlier?

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.370
I just felt too awkward about this

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.530
and didn't know how to tell you about it.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.190
But mainly,

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.370
I didn't want to worry you.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.440
Drop the act!

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.350
How much did Liu Tianfei pay you?

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.980
Zero, honey.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.620
How could I have taken money?

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.700
Honey, I admit I did wrong.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.740
I'm sorry.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.040
I should've been more careful.

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:56.980
My apologies.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.950
I promise this won't happen again.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.340
I'm warning you,

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.530
cut off contact with Liu Tianfei

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.740
from now on.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.900
Longwan and Tianyun

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.460
are not associated in any way!

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.720
Yes, sure, honey.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.010
I'm sorry.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.740
I know

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.890
I did wrong.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:15.850
Tianye.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.090
Why didn't you tell me about your visit?

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.150
Tianfei had someone write an article
attacking Crazy.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.260
Do you know that?

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:24.570
Yes.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.280
Did you tell him to do so?

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:26.850
No.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.640
You heard that from Jiajun?

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.170
Yes.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.760
Now,

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.090
Tianyun is about to be a contractor

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.820
of the Hangang Center project.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.540
This is a crucial time for us.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.950
So I wouldn't let my people go rogue.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.050
But in this matter, Tianfei and his guys

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:46.990
have really gone out of line.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.290
I've reprimanded them.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.750
Then keep Tianfei in line.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.340

happen again.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.380
Why ask that out of a sudden?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.380
I think you should spend more time
managing

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.700
the company affairs.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.940
Sometimes Jiajun could be too impulsive.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.540
I'm worried that he might...

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.750
get conned.

The political landscape in Hanzhou
is highly complex,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.740

to serve as an advisor
to the special task force

so as to make use of his expertise.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.600

established this task force

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.150

to track us down here.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.030
sharp as a tack.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.240
In light of that, I also have

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:39.460
some information to offer.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.660

Yes.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:49.740
The task force already started

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.740
investigating it

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.280
in secret some time ago.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.600

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.090
substantial information.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.150
Have you found anything about Guazi?

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.920
We discovered Guazi's trails

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.300
exactly when we were

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.980

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.260
Director Chu,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.920
we've actually

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.030
spent years searching for Guazi,

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.630
but never caught him.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.590
Those people are accustomed

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:13.850
to killing witnesses.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:16.460
Feng Jiang is in imminent danger now,

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.520
as Guazi is looking for him.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.380
So we must keep up the pace.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.760
The more you charge forward,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.760
the more it benefits the task force.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.610
Look,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.460

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.830

through your mentor.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.070
Does it mean I am...

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.960

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.310

No.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.290
It's just too abrupt.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.720
the manhunt for Guazi has been underway
for many years.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.160
It's been more than

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:58.380
three years since his last crime.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:00.930
Mai Hongchao

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.510
has participated in several CI operations

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.170
and provided important leads

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.290
in the course of solving

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.610
multiple major cases.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.690
Therefore, I think

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.610
he can be assigned a special role.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.540
I know what you're thinking.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.720
You're trying to give a mentee of yours
closure

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.990
and put a wish of your own to rest.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.650
I agree to your idea.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.750
This web of criminals in Hanzhou
is intricately,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.890
complicatedly,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.610
and solidly woven.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:31.900
Now that

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.760
we're here with firm determination,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.220
we'd better not hold back.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.980
Let's use all resources within reach

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.240
to tear this web apart.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.660
So you're well?

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:53.490
Yes.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.190
But I heard from Crazy

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.620
that your medical report didn't look good.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.870
I'm in perfect health.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.320
The medical report

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:02.630
was tampered with by those

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.830
with ill intentions.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.450
Is your leg all good now?

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.280
Yes.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.200
It's fine.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.510
I'll be off if that's all.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.090
Hold on.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.520
I need to tell you something.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.630
Guazi...

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.940
has shown up again.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:25.390
Any leads?

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.370
Yes.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.360
As soon as he surfaces,

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.360
we'll definitely catch him.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.610
Take care of yourself.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:41.250
Those dark circles under your eyes
seem worse now than before.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.880
Enough.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:25.530
Buddy,

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:27.560
you already signed the papers

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.680
and took the money.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.140
But you backed out afterwards.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.960
Really uncool, wasn't it?

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.180
Don't even think of filing a complaint.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:38.740
It won't work.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.680
The body's already been cremated.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.790
Cops investigates cases

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.030
based on evidence.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.600
Got it?

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.220
Karma will get you sooner or later.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.650
You'll die a horrible death.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.220
Listen,

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.830
when you're out of here,

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.430
try making wiser decisions.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.550
If you're brought back here again,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.180
I won't be this nice.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.580
I'll chop you up.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.150
You'll be cut into pieces

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:18.620
just like pork.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.460
My name is Feng Jiang.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.430
[Name: Feng Jiang]

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.560
I'm hereby making a formal allegation
about the Hangang Center incident.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.930
Someone

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.330
has colluded with local criminal gangs

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.620
to threaten a victim's family.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.480
Uncle Tianye, let me handle this.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.770
We've dealt with this guy before.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.640
Go find him out.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.400
Got it.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.120
My brother died in this accident.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.610
But those people

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.830
forged his death certificate

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.750
and forced us to sign off on it.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.160
Okay.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:19.500
Thank you very much.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.700
Otherwise, he'd beat us up.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.290
I've called the public order office.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.660
The police stations will let us know
if they have any news

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.330
about Feng Jiang.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:24.540
Now,

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.730
[Name: Feng Jiang]

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.170
I can't go home.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:29.950
Captain Qin.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.150
We've checked with the funeral home
as you instructed.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:35.280
The death certificate was issued
by Tianyun Hospital,

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.850
stating that Feng Hai
died of a sudden heart attack.

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:39.570
But the staff of the funeral home

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.180
gave a very different account.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.420
They said the body
showed many external injuries,

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.430
as if the victim was killed
by heavy objects.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.140
But they didn't give it too much thought.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.740
Feng Hai's family
signed off on the papers,

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.830
and his death certificate was provided,

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.760
so the staff had his body cremated.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.880
Look at this.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.760
I've watched this video many times,

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.910
in which Feng Jiang makes an allegation.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.310
His story doesn't sound fabricated at all.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:03.910
Kill me if you want.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.540
Feng Jiang...

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.540
is truly determined.

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:12.110
Suppose Feng Hai

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:14.929
died in the construction accident,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.650
and Tianyun Hospital

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:18.600
forged his death certificate...

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.370
Then his family signed off on it.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.790
Tianyun Hospital...

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.409
And Hangang Center.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.909
Feng Jiang's report of crimes

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.250
would involve a lot of people.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.370
Who could be this powerful?

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.889
I think Feng Jiang is in danger now.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.530
We

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.460
must find Feng Jiang

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.570
before those people do.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.429
Otherwise, we'll lose this lead.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.400
Understood?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.659
-Understood.
-Understood.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:51.909
It's a very important task.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:52.870
Take action now.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:53.469
Let's go!

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.320
The weather is so nice today.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.760
Sir.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.420
In fact,

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.520
the weather hasn't been good lately.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.530
I sincerely pray to Buddha

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.760
for good weather

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.550
and unity

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.060
in Hanzhou.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.170
Sure.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:22.650
It's a wish

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:24.010
shared by us all.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.540
At this age, I no longer

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.790
seek great achievements.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.250
All I want is to retire with dignity.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:39.530
How time flies. I've been working
in Hanzhou for so many years.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.820
Now, the voice inside me

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.550
is just like what the posts
at construction sites

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.430
say,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.670
"safety first."

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.250
Sir,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.490
don't worry.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.290
My people are already
looking for Feng Jiang.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.890
He can't hide for long.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.460
Action matters most.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.650
You see,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.590
I just got a tip.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.420
The provincial department

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.390
has sent a special task force here.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:09.950
A special task force?

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.020
Yes.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.210
During this critical time,

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.860
be careful with your approaches.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.310
Focus on finding Feng Jiang

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.860
and fending off the task force
at the same time.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.260
You must figure out the members

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:28.880
of the task force, their movements,

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.610
and if they have planted anyone

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.400
in the police department.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.950
Well, Sir, look,

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.430
as per the standard procedure
within the police system,

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:39.660
special task forces usually operate
in secret.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.950
The first thing they'd do
is an internal investigation.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.690
Don't you think
I'm in too sensitive a position now?

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.830
I'm afraid any conspicuous moves I take

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.470
might backfire on me.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.480
Shouldn't we lay low and still

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.770
at a moment like this?

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.290
How's your relationship with Yan?
Pretty good, right?

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.220
Yes, we both worked in narcotics before.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.530
But he's a director now,

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.080
while you're just a deputy.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.690
When will it be your turn?

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.840
Honestly, at your age,

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.500
I was already in a leadership role.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.930
It's time you thought about

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.980
how much higher
you could climb up the career ladder.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.460
Only those in charge
get to work in the office,

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:35.860
while everyone else
is just a foot soldier.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.750
You do know that clearly

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.970
without me telling you, right?

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.930
Yes, I do.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.160
Of course I know that.

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.440
A person had better

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.460
assess the situation correctly

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.430
and keep a clear head.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.760
How old is Yan now?

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.060
Isn't he older than you?

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.980
You're a competent officer.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.650
In my eyes,

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.130
you're better than him.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.830
Why isn't it you
who's being the leader now?

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.140
Sir,

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:10.600
allow me

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:12.220
to state my position.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.670
Please rest assured.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:16.780
I won't be a disappointment

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.350
to you.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.190
Good.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.570
Come on, have a seat.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.550
What beautiful scenery.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.700
Such a lovely place.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.420
It's eye-opening.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.130
This mansion belongs to Master Wenxuan,

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.530
nephew of Mr. Liu from Tianyun Group.

00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:44.840
The point is, you have a really nice car.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.300
Master Wenxuan, care for a speech?

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.130
Just address a few words.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.130
Look at this house.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.860
How much area does it cover?

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.070
Alright, keep it down.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.750
If my dad's home, we're done for.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.900
Okay. Sure.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:57.400
Got it. Got it.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.150
Let's go.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.730
Who's there?

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.200
What are you doing back there?

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.500
Who is it?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.050
What are you doing outside my home?

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.380
Where are you going?

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.000
Come back here!

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.800
Where do you think you're going?

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:24.730
Say something.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:25.390
Who are you?

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.430
You're a thief, huh?

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.380
Let me see what you stole.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:29.800
Come on.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.260
-Take it out!
-Take it out.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:32.860
I didn't steal!

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.960
I'm looking for Zhao Peng.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.290
You're looking for my dad?

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:40.520
Who are you?

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.680
Why do you want with him?

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.410
Zhao Peng is a real thug.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.180
That construction project of his

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:53.730
caused...

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:56.120
my brother's death.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.450
He's a murderer.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.060
That's nonsense!

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.380
Master Wenxuan!

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.380
Master Wenxuan!

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.080
-Beat him up!
-Let's beat him!

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.920
How dare you slander my father, you loser!
