WEBVTT

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:54.600
That's the smell.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.359
Coal Mine Old Street

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.960
I'm back.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.159
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:06.599
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.400
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.319
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.560
Neighbors

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.359
Zhao Fengsheng

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:12.879
I'm back, neighbors.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.000
Get out of here!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.959
I'll kill you!

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.640
Get lost!

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.079
Wait a second.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.159
Neighbors

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.400
Don't waste such good food.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.560
Neighbors

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.640
You dare to come back?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.799
Neighbors, listen to me.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.519
Hold on.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.519
Hit him!

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:26.879
I've turned over a new leaf.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:27.799
Neighbors

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.760
My name is Zhao Fengsheng.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.280
Five years ago,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.439
my brothers and I crossed

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.640
the underworld in Bian Shui.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:33.599
The trouble spread to the Old Street.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.599
Neighbors,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:36.959
you had some small grievances with me.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.920
Boss.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.159
Boss.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.079
Members of the Yunting Mercenary Group's Southwest Squad,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.120
reporting for duty.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.079
Report for what?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.719
This is a gift from your brothers.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.159
This is Bian Shui,

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.120
not Amir.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.439
With your big show of force,

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.120
what if you scare my dear neighbors?

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:10.960
Boss,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.680
we know

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.159
you're returning home quietly this time.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.000
That's why we only dared to wait for you here.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080
We didn't go near the Old Street at all.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.479
Xiao Jiu is still the sensible one.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.039
Brothers,

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:20.759
this time I'm back

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.520
just wanting to live a simple, quiet life.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:23.960
It's also my parents' dying wish.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.240
So take the gift back.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.000
Boss,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.479
it was all thanks to your leadership

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.520
that we brothers

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.199
were able to get out of Amir,

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.759
that living hell.

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.439
Yes.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.159
Now,

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.039
the brothers have all inherited their family businesses.

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:36.080
My family

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.919
has also agreed to let me take over

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:38.479
all the operations in the Bian Shui area.

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.039
So,

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.599
from now on, just say the word, boss,

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.159
and in the Bian Shui area,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.080
there's nothing my Li family can't handle.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.039
What's all this shouting?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.599
Can't you understand plain speech?

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.000
All of you, go back.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.719
I'll call you if I need anything.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.240
Yes, sir.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.120
Those who forced me out of the Old Street

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.080
should get to know

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.120
Madman Zhao all over again.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.800
Zhao Fengsheng is back in Coal Mine Old Street.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.960
We can't let him find out

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.319
our secret in the Old Street.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.560
Find a way to drive him out.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.479
Fight!

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.400
Go, go, go!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.280
Fight!

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.199
Let's go, let's go!

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.960
What a disgraceful pose.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.120
Can't control your pants, huh?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.560
Who gave you the guts to sleep with my girl?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.360
Brother Xiaobei,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.919
Gangzi and I drank too much.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.280
You can't blame him entirely.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.199
Did I tell you to speak?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.360
Chen Xiaobei, you human trafficker!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.960
What kind of man bullies a woman?

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.280
If you've got something, take it out on me!

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.240
That's more like it.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.400
Brother Crow says

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.759
we're going to renovate this dump of a bathhouse

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.719
properly.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.840
Turn it into Bian Shui's biggest money pit.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.080
That way,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.639
Zhou Xiaoman and her sisters

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.240
will have a place to earn money, right?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.080
Crow ruined the Old Street so badly.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.919
And you're still working for him?

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.319
Don't you believe the neighbors will kill you?

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.479
In the neighbors' hearts, I, Chen Xiaobei,

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.800
am a good boy.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.199
Do you think they'll believe me

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.519
or you, one of the Four Pests of the Old Street?

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.800
Besides,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.639
the one who harmed the Old Street was Zhao Fengsheng.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.600
What does that have to do with me, Chen Xiaobei?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.360
Xiao Bei.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.439
Why is it that as soon as I'm back,

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.160
I hear you talking trash about me?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.040
Shengzi!

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:34.240
Madman Zhao!

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.720
It really is you!

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.279
What are you doing?

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.360
Stop being so girly.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.519
Because of Zhou Xiaoman,

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:41.879
Crow's people

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.279
want our bathhouse.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.319
Brother Shengzi, all these years you...

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.079
Cut the crap.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.439
Is this enough?

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:58.680
You think a lousy watch will get rid of me?

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.560
I want the whole darn bathhouse!

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.720
Think I'm giving you face, huh?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.000
While I was away,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.519
you tried a honey trap on my brother?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.959
How about

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.879
you and I have a proper fight?

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:10.759
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.160
You still dare to oppose Brother Crow?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.680
You ungrateful traitor!

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.199
Brother Xiaobei!

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.519
Since when is Zhao Fengsheng such a good fighter?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.560
Want to stay and learn a few moves from me?

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:46.639
Brother Shengzi!

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:48.399
You just wait!

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.839
Brother Crow will send people to deal with you!

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.480
Let's go.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.839
Xiaoman.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:53.240
Brother Gangzi.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.920
Come on, let's go.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.600
Go.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.399
Hurry, go!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.839
Shengzi

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.079
Oh my god

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.680
Bro, I've missed you to death

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:08.240
Don't be so girly

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.680
Still haven't lost that Northeast accent

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.959
I'm a Northeast boy through and through

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:13.879
Don't wanna change it

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.319
How've you been all these years in prison?

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.199
Hurry up and take your clothes off

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.000
Let me see if you're missing anything

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.120
Who went to prison?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.279
Who's spreading that rumor?

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.079
I wasn't in prison

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.720
Then why didn't you call once in five years?

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.199
I thought you...

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.439
Can't you wish me well?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.959
You know what, kid?

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.639
Ever since the rumor you were in jail spread

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.959
Your "Madman Zhao" reputation got even louder

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.199
Now, in our Old Street

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.839
Whenever a kid starts crying

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.839
Just mention your name

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.000
They're guaranteed to shut right up

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.879
You're really my good brother, huh?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.639
You've completely ruined my reputation

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:49.199
I'm sorry

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.519
Sorry, sorry, Shengzi

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.720
You just got back

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.879
Let me welcome you properly

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.120
Wash away the bad luck

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.160
Where's Hua Lian?

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.240
Hua Lian had some business to attend to

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.120
We won't wait for him

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.399
Let your big brother entertain you first

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.160
Can we get something a bit more decent?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.160
Wait upstairs

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.720
Let's get you a girl for a massage

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.439
I'll make sure you're taken care of real nice

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:29.839
Hello, big brother

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.360
I'm your masseuse for today

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.519
Just call me Lele

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.759
Gangzi's doing alright

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.720
Keeping such a sexy lady around

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.879
So, big brother, can I start

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.000
your massage now?

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.639
Lele, right?

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.839
Sure, sure

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.480
You look a bit unfamiliar, big brother

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.519
You're not from our Old Street

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.399
Just got back from abroad

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.279
It's normal you don't know me

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.600
Abroad, huh?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.879
But I heard

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.000
girls overseas are very open

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.680
No, no, no

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.240
Whether they're open or not

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.040
depends entirely on personal charm

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:23.839
Take my looks, for example

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.759
Wherever I go

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.800
there's always

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.519
an open-minded sisterhood

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.519
Lele, Lele

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.240
A little lighter, please

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.279
Sorry, big brother

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.559
I'm pressing the acupoint for your kidneys

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.000
You're not... kidney-deficient, are you?

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.279
Kidney-deficient?

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:43.080
That's absolutely impossible

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.360
Press harder

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:46.039
I won't make a single sound

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.320
Alrighty then

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:02.879
Shengzi just got back

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.600
Er Ni, take it easy

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:06.000
Don't break him

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.799
Er Ni?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.480
It's your old lady, me

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.360
Who let this young mistress out?

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.440
Er Ni

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.919
Long time no see

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:29.639
You're something else, Zhao Fengsheng

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.559
No wonder I chased you for so long

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:32.840
and you never agreed

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.799
Turns out you like foreign girls

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.000
What's the matter?

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.559
Think I'm not open enough?

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.159
I'm wrong

00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.120
I'm really wrong

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:44.679
Then tell me

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.320
why didn't you come find me first when you got back?

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.120
No, I... I...

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.120
Fine, don't say it

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.600
Come on, let's go get our marriage license

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.440
What?

00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:54.600
Get married

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.559
I've waited over ten years for you

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.600
You dare disagree?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.559
I was only gone for five years

00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.000
How did it become over ten?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.320
You're still playing dumb here?

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:04.240
I've been following you since I was sixteen

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.720
How many times have I confessed to you?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.679
Every time, you found an excuse to avoid me

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.879
What's that supposed to mean?

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:10.399
You look down on me that much?

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.120
No

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.799
Er Ni

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.480
We're like brother and sister, too familiar

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:15.399
I don't mean it like that

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:15.639
I...

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:16.879
You don't mean it like that?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.360
I don't believe it

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.320
Today, I'm gonna

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.639
force myself on you

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:33.440
Don't

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:40.480
You've grown up, huh
