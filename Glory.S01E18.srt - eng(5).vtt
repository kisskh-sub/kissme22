Come here!

Since Lady Shanbao fell sick,

people from the Hualin Courtyard

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.680
have rarely come out.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.770
I've been keeping a close eye
on Miss Xiu Qiong,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.970
but I haven't discovered any movement.

Stay away from Xiu Qiong.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.770
Since ancient times,
those who manage households

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.250
have always been suspicious.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.980
Lady Shanbao is especially so.

To find Madam Yang,
we must lie low patiently

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.100
-Okay!
-Spread it over here, too.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.500
Okay!

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.110
You blind fool!

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.960
Song! Song!

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.360
Song!

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.810
What are you doing?

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.010
How could you hit him?

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.110
He hasn't slept

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.910
for three consecutive days.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.240
Do you have no humanity?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.270
It's his own fault for being useless.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:05.840
Why are you all

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.670
staring at me?

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.790
Hurry up and dig ditches to drain water!

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:10.510
If the roots of the tea trees
rot or wither,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.830
all of you will be held accountable!

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.090
None of you can escape!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.260
Get to work now!

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.280
Stand up! Take them to work now!

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.390
I'm quitting!

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.190
You hit people indiscriminately.
Let's quit!

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.290
I'm quitting! I'm quitting! I'm quitting!

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.300
You're all tea slaves of the Rong family.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.010
Each of you
has signed the servitude indenture.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.630
So what if I hit you?
What can you do about it?

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.310
I'm quitting! I'm quitting! I'm quitting!

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.290
Stop it!

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:13.710
I'm telling you all to stop it!

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.850
Stop it!

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.660
Stop it, you all!

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.710
It's Lady Shanbao!

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.040
Lady Shanbao is back!

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.080
Rong Yunyin.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.300
Is this how you manage the plantations?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.240
Buddies!

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.630
The Rong family
doesn't treat us as humans!

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.270
Lady Yunyin
is her own younger sister.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.510
How could she possibly
speak for outsiders?

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.570
-That's right!
-Yeah! That's right!

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.380
-They're a family!
-That's right!

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.910
The tea plantations at the foot
of the mountains are all flooded.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.640
Many tea trees on the mountains

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.370
have also been damaged by hail.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.770
This year's autumn tea

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.660
depends entirely
on these several plantations.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.800
Guys, please help to

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.970
dig ditches to drain water overnight

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.300
so that the tea trees
won't soak in water for too long.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.030
We must find a way

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.250
to preserve next year's harvest.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.870
Your Rong family
always abuses and exploits the workers.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.290
How could you still expect us
to work hard for you?

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.600
That's right! I'm quitting!

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.630
Let's go down the mountains tonight!

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.000
-Let's go!
-Let's go! I'm quitting!

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.930
-Let's go!
-That's right! Let's go!

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.990
What rights do you have to hit others?

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:30.460
Stop!

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.390
Exactly!

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.790
The monthly wages in Rong's Plantation

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.720
are already 10% higher than the others'.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.320
During every tea-picking season,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.960
Lady Shanbao would even give you

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.750
extra five dou of rice each month.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.170
Those who have elderly people at home

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.150
would receive
additional firewood, wine and meat.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.480
Lady Yunyin may be overbearing,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.270
but Lady Shanbao has never

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.550
treated any of you unfairly.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:49.080
Besides, you all

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.500
have signed the servitude indenture.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.510
Once you defy the tea plantation's owner,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.720
sending you to officials for punishment
would be a minor consequence.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.390
In the future, if Lady Shanbao

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.920
makes a statement about it,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.200
which tea plantation
will dare to hire you?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.700
For a momentary fit of anger,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.480
you might make your family members
live a hard life.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.480
It's not worth it.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.700
That's truly not worth it.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.630
Capture that ringleader

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.320
for me now!

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.990
I'd like to see who dares to do it!

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:18.510
W-Well...

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.670
Shanbao.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.320
All of you, look carefully!

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.720
The mark on this whip

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.960
is in the shape of tea leaves

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.670
and has been passed down for 400 years.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.750
The Rong family
has planted vast tea groves here

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.270
and established tea trade routes.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.420
In the city, hundreds of

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.550
large or small shops

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.280
all make a living by tea leaves.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.000
You are all mountain people,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.030
who have lived here for generations.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.620
You depend on the mountains for a living

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.030
by growing and processing tea leaves.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.360
Without tea, you cannot survive.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.960
Without tea,

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.030
up and down the mountains,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.690
how many people would starve?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.550
Tea is the lifeblood of tea artisans.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.790
This tea plantation is my lifeblood.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.840
Those who are willing to stay tonight

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.720
will receive extra two months' wages.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.670
As for those who dare to
leave the mountains without permission,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.150
if the autumn tea leaves
can't be delivered

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.940
and the reputation
of the Rong family's tea is damaged,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.500
they would be considered as destroying

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.360
the livelihood of countless tea farmers

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.510
and making enemies

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.440
with me forever.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.680
Just see if I would spare him.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.390
What Lady Shanbao said makes sense.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:35.960
Yes.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.120
Lady Shanbao truly

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.750
shows solicitude
for rough fellows like us.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.030
With Lady Shanbao here,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.320
we don't need to worry.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.200
Yi.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.700
Give her a hoe.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.090
Tell her to go down there
and clear the silt too.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.720
Take a hoe!

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.830
I'm not going!

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.490
I'm not going, Shanbao!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.920
I'm your own sister.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.670
How could you treat me like this?

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.800
I'm sorry, Shanbao!

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.720
I'm not going! I'm not going!

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.360
Shanbao!

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.890
This boy just fainted from shock.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.560
His life is not in danger for now.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.760
Take him down to bandage his wounds now.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:20.850
Lady Shanbao.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.870
Get to work now.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.390
Let's get to work!

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.360
Come on!

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.440
Let's get to work!

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.180
Just disperse.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.330
Having whipped her this time
will deepened her hatred.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.600
If you want her to truly submit to you

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.380
and try to make peace with her,

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.170
I don't think
you can achieve that in the future.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.200
Her feelings for me are worthless.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.080
But my tea leaves are extremely valuable.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.550
I can't afford to wait.
Nor do I dare to wait.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.730
Your kindness has been wasted.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.079
However, as for what I've promised you,

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.560
I will definitely keep my word.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.589
Rong Shanbao, you'd better

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.720
truly remember

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.780
this promise well.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.430
The weather has cleared up.
Guys, act quickly!

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.770
-Okay!
-Okay!

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.560
[Rong's Tea Plantation]

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.110
Lady Yunxi, Lady Xiangling.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.160
Mr. Yan.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.350
Wasn't there some trouble

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:09.920
in the tea plantations on the mountains?

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.850
Where is Yunyin?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.310
Yunxi!

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.220
Yunxi!

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.860
Yunxi, save me now!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.220
Save me now!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.510
Yunxi!

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.800
I... I can't stand it anymore!

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.090
Take me back home now!

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.160
Yunyin.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.980
You were sent here
to manage the tea plantations.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.750
How did you end up
looking like a mud monkey?

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.680
What happened?

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.300
It's all Rong Shanbao's fault.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.970
I fell into a mud pit.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.550
Shut up! All of you, shut up!

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.030
Who dares to laugh?

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.550
Shut up!

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.750
Shut up!

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.030
Believe it or not,
I'll slaughter all of you!

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:51.760
Lady Yunyin.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.550
I'm afraid
what you're saying doesn't count.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.510
That's right.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.400
Yeah! That's right! Exactly!

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.360
Where is Lady Shanbao?
How come she's not here?

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.160
Lady Shanbao
was worried about the new plantation,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.290
so she asked Mr. Lu to go there with her.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.200
Is there any medicine for wounds here?

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.600
Mr. Yan is badly injured.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.240
He must have got injured

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.830
from clearing the obstacles
on the roads previously.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.000
I told you not to do it personally,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.870
but you refused to listen to me.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.960
How are we supposed to explain this
to Grandmother?

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.030
Hurry! Take him

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.490
to the tea shed over there
to apply medicine.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.310
Young Master, you're too honest.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.750
Look how cunning that guy is.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.400
He always chooses the perfect moments
to curry favor.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.130
It's not Lady Shanbao's fault.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.920
Yunxi, take me back home now!

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.440
Yunxi!

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.240
Yunxi!

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.270
You withdrew all the workers
who were repairing the embankments,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.960
which caused the 800 acres of tea fields

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.700
at the foot of the mountains
to be flooded.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.720
Tonight,
you've been left here to dig ditches,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.720
which could barely count as
atonement for your mistakes.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.190
Otherwise,
if Grandmother hears about this,

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:13.850
you'll be in serious trouble.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.860
After you've made such a big mistake,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.350
except for

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.830
your own sister born from the same mother,

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.590
who else would help you clean up the mess?

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.590
This is not just punishment for you,

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.450
but she's also trying to save you.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.690
Rong Yunyin,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.930
you've been muddle-headed
for so many years.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.590
Who is close or estranged?
And who is good or bad?

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.220
It's also time for you to wake up.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.280
My Lady, he's the one from the He family.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.910
Tell him to go back.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.400
Haven't we already asked someone
to deliver the message?

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.510
When Lady Yunxi has time,

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.750
she will surely meet with you.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.880
Master He, please wait patiently
for a few more days.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.940
Please go back now.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:51.110
No more nonsense.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.960
The tea mountains are all flooded.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.280
You're still trying to fool people, huh?

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.540
Bring her down to talk.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:00.760
Come down!

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.550
Lady Yunxi!

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.200
Previously, I heard that your He family

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.420
was a powerful non-native,

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.550
specializing in gaining improper benefits

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.790
on the waterways.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.810
I thought it was just a rumor,

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.240
but now I'm seeing it with my own eyes.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.090
Who do you think my Rong family is?

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.920
How dare you, a non-native,
act so impudently?

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.510
I can't worry about all that now.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.310
After this year's autumn-tea-leaf picking
is finished,

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.070
if the Rong family
can't deliver the tea leaves,

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.200
half of my assets

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.790
will be lost in there.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.840
Unlike you,
I wasn't born with a silver spoon.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.720
I've earned every copper coin

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.720
by fighting through wind and waves.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.440
Lady Yunxi, I'm sorry but you have to

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.240
come with me.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.350
When Old Madam Rong
gives me a definite answer,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.240
I promise I'll send you back home
safe and sound.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.000
Stop it!

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.920
Lady Shanbao has said
these several days might not be peaceful

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.550
and has specifically ordered me

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.280
to escort Lady Yunxi back home.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.270
Alright.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.790
I've also lived my life
on the edge of a knife

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.450
and have never feared anyone.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.480
Truth has never depended on
how loudly one speaks.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.140
Your Rong family
owes me 1,000 jin of tea leaves.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.710
It's all clearly written

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.070
on the paper.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.750
We may have to settle this
at the County Office,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.440
which will cause you great trouble.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.960
Go ahead and file charges if you want.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.720
There are still a few more questions

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.250
Lady Shanbao
would like to ask you, Master He.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:23.480
He Gui!

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.720
Have you settled

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.750
the murder case

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.120
you committed in Pingjiang?

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.000
Your 5,000-tael stolen money

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.350
can't be used to buy our legal tea leaves.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.310
I suggest you to keep the money
to buy your life instead.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.600
In Linji's territory,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.050
even a powerful non-native
would become a struggling scoundrel.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.070
Lady Shanbao
wasn't going to deal with you,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.360
but you're
asking for trouble here yourself.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.890
Your deposit
has been sent back to your place.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.510
Your eight sworn brothers

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.400
who traveled with you

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.270
are now tied up

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.390
under the big willow tree
at the Shili Slope outside the city.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.310
In the future, if you dare to be violent
and aggressive again,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.110
killing innocent people

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.590
and breaking
the Rong family's cardinal rules,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.440
even with the 100 thievish guards

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.750
you've brought,

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.760
just see
whether you can leave the city or not.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.000
Was it really Rong Shanbao

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.460
who asked you to pick me up?

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.970
Lady Yunxi, please.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.630
[Rong Mansion]

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:26.010
Thankfully, my dear Bao is here.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.930
If we had relied on those several girls,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.330
who can't tell right from wrong,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.160
I'm afraid they would have

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.240
made terrible mistakes

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.590
and would ruin
our Rong family's century-old business

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.520
sooner or later.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.750
I was right about you.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.500
You are truly
the pillar of our Rong family.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.640
We can't be without you even for a day.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.030
Grandmother, I'm back.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.460
You boasted about it in front of me,

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.550
but you didn't even show up
after causing trouble.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.000
Is this
how you sisters take responsibility?

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.660
Kneel down!

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.830
Grandmother, please let me explain.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.690
It was Yunyin who swore to Heavens

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.030
and asked me to entirely entrust
the tea plantations to her.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.510
She said even if the sky fell,

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.170
she would be able to handle it.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.480
It's my fault for being gullible

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.330
and believing in her boastful words.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.670
And I was too focused
on the autumn tea business,

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.200
so I didn't monitor the work
in the plantations on a daily basis.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.110
Laster, I became so soft-hearted that

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.510
I was deceived by others,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.680
signing a contract with the He family.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.480
I didn't know he was such a brute,

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.510
who somehow

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.830
heard some gossip

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.510
and believed that the Rong family
couldn't deliver the tea leaves.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.110
It almost led to big trouble.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.440
Because of that,
Lady Shanbao had to work while being sick,

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.240
and you got so worried and angry.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:52.550
Please forgive me, Grandmother.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.480
I'm sorry.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.400
Yun'e.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.030
Intercede for me now.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.930
Three days ago, right in this hall,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.790
Yunxi and Yunyin firmly made a guarantee,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.310
only saying
for a hundred years in Linji,

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.070
there had never been heavy rain
destroying the tea leaves.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.960
You even withdrew the people

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.480
Lady Shanbao had sent
to repair the embankments.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.640
It showed that you only cared about
immediate benefits

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.040
with no long-term plans.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.440
Unfortunately, Heaven wasn't on your side.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.480
The tea plantations at the foot
of the mountains are all destroyed.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:25.590
The tea trees on the mountains

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.250
were all damaged by hail, too.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.270
Now that this disaster has happened,

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.930
with all this mess left there,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.200
what should we do?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:33.750
Your knees

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.350
aren't made of gold and jade.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.680
The tea trees that were washed away

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.930
won't come back
no matter how long you kneel.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.560
Besides,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.890
you've always been close to Yunyin.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.400
You two are on the same side.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.590
How would you bear to let her

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.480
suffer alone in the tea plantations?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:45.920
Perhaps you'd better

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.780
share some of the burden with her.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.750
Please don't be angry, Grandmother.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.480
When a newbie tries to pan-fry tea leaves,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.310
he might scorch them,
make them too yellow,

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.070
overdo it

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.170
or fail to dry them thoroughly.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.110
No newbies could do it perfectly
without any mistakes.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.070
At this point,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.700
blaming Yunxi won't help.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.790
Let's just find a way to make up for it.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.270
But please don't worry, Grandmother.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.500
I've already asked people

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.000
to urgently transfer tea leaves
from the prefectures and counties

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.060
that are unaffected by the disaster.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.640
However,
the Longjing tea leaves produced elsewhere

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.570
are not as good as those from Linji.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.070
Yunxi, I'd like to ask you

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:32.950
to visit our old customers one by one

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:33.760
and discuss

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.410
how to make up
for this year's autumn tea leaves first.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.740
We absolutely cannot
damage the Rong family's reputation.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.050
Of course.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.330
Watch your step.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.160
Come here.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.080
There's another matter

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.910
I need to tell you, Grandmother.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:06.850
This child's mother

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240
was a tea worker in our plantations.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.100
She often delivered meals
and did trivial work at the embankments.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.070
A few days ago, she was unfortunately
washed away by the flood.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.680
Seeing that this child has nowhere to go

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.510
and she's so adorable and beautiful,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.970
I want to keep her by my side

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.770
and adopt her as my daughter

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.480
to prevent her from being homeless

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.010
and all alone in this world.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.960
She's just a child.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.860
If you like her,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.660
just keep her by your side.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.040
It's her good fortune as well.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.110
Did you hear that?

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.680
From today onwards,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.940
you are a daughter of the Rong family.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.240
Look.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.350
It wants to eat something.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.200
Put it here.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.550
It's all spilled out.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.790
Rong Shanbao.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.790
You were aware of Mr. He's background.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.790
You also knew
Yunyin's temperament very well.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.030
Obviously, you set up a trap

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:30.640
and tried to make us fall into it.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.040
Do you think I can't sense

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.960
these schemes of yours at all?

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:35.960
Sooner or later, I'll expose everything
in front of Grandmother.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960
Then none of us can get any benefits.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.540
Now I understand,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.020
three years ago,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.180
when you went all the way
to Fuzhou to learn tea skills,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.110
you truly benefited a lot from it.‌

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.620
A moment of passion

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.440
resulted in this romantic entanglement.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.240
Even if Grandmother finds out about it,

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:55.920
I'll just be labeled as

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.320
a rebellious young girl.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.580
It won't shake my foundation.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.880
Grandmother will still have to
keep me around

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.160
to compete with you.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.130
This is what an heir

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.080
must go through.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.110
Just like a whetstone,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.680
I'm still of great use to Grandmother.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.410
How would she easily give me up?

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.980
Don't think that

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.870
you can threaten me

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.660
with this child.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.330
Call her Mother.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.570
You...

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.790
In the past, children from our Rong family

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.360
were treated by all sisters
as their own kids

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.820
and were raised together.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.490
If you teach her
to call us Mother or Aunt,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.060
it would just create alienation instead.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.520
Since she calls me Mother,

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.530
calling you Mother as well

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.420
is simply following the old custom

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.750
of the Rong family sisters
raising children together.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.190
What right do outsiders have to comment?

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.200
Mother.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.310
Regardless of what kind of person

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.770
her birth father might be,

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.920
and whether Grandmother
would allow him to join our family,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.850
I only acknowledge this one thing.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.400
The offsprings of the Rong family

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.330
cannot be left abandoned outside.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.400
Let's raise and teach
our daughter properly.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.880
Don't let her become as wilful

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.240
and undisciplined as Yunyin
when she grows up.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.640
By that time,
it'll be too late to regret it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.920
Pack up the young master's things

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.520
properly.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.000
Then take them to the Xinfang Pavilion.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.410
When did I say I was moving out?

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.060
Who told you to touch my things
without permission?

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.230
Jun Dai! What's going on?

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.820
Say something.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:48.790
I ordered them

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.440
to move your belongings

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.100
back to the Xinfang Pavilion.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.440
Lady Shanbao,
you haven't recovered from your cold yet.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.750
There should be someone
taking care of you by your side.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.610
I'm not moving.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:59.280
Go ahead.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:03.840
Put them down!

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.290
I've thought carefully
about what you said.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.070
Though we are sisters

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:33.790
from the same family,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.500
I can't always give in,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.140
which might pose a threat.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.960
Those who should be suppressed
must be suppressed, too.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.060
Those who should be restricted
must also be restricted.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.790
I have to make plans decisively

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960
and implement them appropriately.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.750
I can't damage our sisterhood

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.480
or break Grandmother's heart.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.960
I also need to handle everything
nicely and decently.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.800
Therefore, I've made up my mind.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.040
I'll keep Yunyin

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.160
in the tea plantations
to atone for her mistakes.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.590
She always complains
that Grandmother favors others

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.480
and doesn't allow her
to enter the plantations.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.920
So I'll just ask her to start with

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.590
such trivial work as digging ditches
and planting tea trees.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.480
Once she understands others' hardships,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.440
she'll realize what mistakes she has made.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.550
We'll discuss this matter later.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.409
But Lady Shanbao, I'm not moving.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.770
Delivery of this year's autumn tea leaves
will inevitably be delayed.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.920
Some of our old customers
are difficult to deal with.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.920
I'm afraid they won't save face for Yunxi.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.760
I'd better visit them personally
to smooth things over.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.440
Rong Shanbao, today, why are you...

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.630
Xiu Qiong,
stay home and make preparations.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.920
You don't need to come with me.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.440
Yes.

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.030
Rong Shanbao.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:31.920
I haven't finished speaking yet,

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.520
and you're already leaving.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.020
You used me and then dumped me.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:40.010
How could there be such a person
in this world?

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.620
Congratulations, Mr. Lu!

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.770
Mr. Lu, there will be a wedding.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:52.880
A wedding?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.840
Once we finish the ceremony
in front of the paired pillars

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.880
in the Rong family's ancestral hall,

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.010
we'll be husband and wife officially.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.590
In the hundred years
of the Rong family's history,

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.150
there has never been another case
like this.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.080
That's not okay.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.510
My Lord, you are a distinguished official
in the imperial court

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.150
and a close minister to the Emperor

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.670
with limitless prospects.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.670
You're only gaining experience
in the provinces for a few years.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.440
You'll return to the capital
sooner or later.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.800
If you're truly going to get married,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.030
you can choose a prime minister's daughter

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.630
or even a prince's daughter.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.150
How could you stay in Linji

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.070
and become a son-in-law
to that Rong family?

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.320
As an official, I strive to
bring benefits for the local people.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.030
It doesn't matter

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.560
where I work as an official.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.760
Even though there are many powerful people

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.700
and beautiful ladies in the capital,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:29.670
how could I possibly find

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.920
another Lady Rong Shanbao from there
to be my match?

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.250
Fortunately, I've been

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.960
steadfast in my principles
and cautious from the start.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.630
I never curry favor with the powerful men

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.360
or make marriage promises easily.

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.190
I've been determined to wait for someone
I truly love.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.300
Otherwise, if I were to change my mind
and get engaged to Lady Rong Shanbao now,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.180
wouldn't I become

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.780
a person who breaks his word?

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:50.830
What did you just say?

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.970
I think you're just jealous

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.830
and trying to stand in my way.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.630
My Lord!

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:57.840
Alright, alright.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.190
I know no matter how hard you've tried,

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.400
you still can't get into the Rong family.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.190
Being able to see Bao once

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.960
should be considered as your good fortune.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.880
If one constantly
harbors jealousy and anxiety,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.080
it's easy for illness
to develop in his organs.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.550
That would be unfortunate.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.840
What are you implying?

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.280
My Lord, you're going to marry a beauty

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.440
and are quite satisfied,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.230
but you mustn't
forget the important matters.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.670
The Wei family's old case
remains unsolved,

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.150
and Madam Yang is still missing.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.840
Nor do we know what tricks

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.240
the Rong family has played
in this process.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.730
As the presiding judge,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.130
you will eventually face her in court.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.750
If you two truly get married,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.110
how will the Wei family's grievances
be redressed?

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:32.770
And how will you make a ruling?

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.430
I will certainly be fair and impartial,

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.760
showing no favoritism.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:50.400
Even if you maintain absolute fairness

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.940
and show no favoritism to relatives,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.980
Lady Rong Shanbao

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.160
is extremely proud.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.030
She will surely suspect that

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.030
you have ulterior motives
for infiltrating into the Rong family.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.560
Let alone becoming lovers,

00:36:59.110 --> 00:36:59.760
I'm afraid

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.130
she might confront you with weapons.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.130
She won't do that.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:05.250
And I certainly won't.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.630
Even if that doesn't happen,

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.320
how will you handle the situation?

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.710
Therefore,
this wedding with the Rong family

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.310
absolutely cannot proceed.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:11.900
No way.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:12.950
My Lord!

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.150
You haven't even thought this through.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.110
The Rong family is prestigious

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.550
with great power throughout Linji.

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:24.510
How would they tolerate me
refusing the marriage arbitrarily?

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.240
Although I've infiltrated into
the Rong family now,

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.670
I haven't seen Madam Yang yet.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.180
My household has even been attacked,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.830
and my status remains unclear.

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.150
Before reinforcements
arrive from the capital,

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.950
can I even leave the Rong family?

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.520
My Lord, you're right.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.000
I've failed to consider it thoroughly.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.380
What should we do then?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.900
To find Madam Yang,

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.520
I already have a plan.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.000
However, there's an important matter

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.400
that I need you to handle.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.400
Last night, while interrogating Qing Yun,
I got his confession

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.320
that after his success,

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.670
anyone who wanted to
curry favor with Xu Song

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.110
must first pay him a visit.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.360
He also didn't reject anyone's visit

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.810
and has benefited greatly from it.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:57.630
He even keeps

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.670
an opera performer as his mistress
in the Zhenhe Street.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.500
She possesses

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.020
a ledger secretly,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.630
which has records about all bribe money
Xu Song has received.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.400
But you can't deal with it in person.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400
I'm afraid Xu Song

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.670
has already become suspicious of you.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.010
Since it's the vital physical evidence,

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.180
I should go myself.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.710
My Lord, don't worry.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.320
I will be extra cautious.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.900
It's getting late.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.880
My Lord, you should go back now

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.140
lest the Rong family's members
should become suspicious.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:28.510
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.970
Come and take a look!

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.630
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.550
Fragrance pouches and sachets!

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.590
[Baozhi Pharmacy]

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.390
Young Master.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.110
After the heavy rain,

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.000
Lady Shanbao has been incredibly busy.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.590
Her daily medicine

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.920
is all decocted in the tea plantations.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:51.670
There are available doctors
accompanying her.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.840
Why did Miss Xiu Qiong

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.970
go to the Baohe Hall?

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.780
Let's talk when we get back.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:04.630
Young Master.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.090
These two men are acting suspiciously.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.290
There must be something fishy going on.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.270
Lady Rong Shanbao
is difficult to deal with.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.110
This is a perfect chance
to let those two men

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.230
be my vanguards.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.360
It's also good
to have them test the water.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.690
Keep a close eye on them.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.390
If there's any unusual activity,

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:18.790
report it to me immediately.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.270
Yes.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.590
-Young Master!
-My tofu!

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.800
What's wrong with you?

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:43.710
You knocked over my tofu.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.640
You can't leave!

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.650
Take this.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.480
This is not okay.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.960
Tofu means "gathering luck."

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.360
You've knocked over my container,

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.030
and my luck has run away.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.800
We've given you the money.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800
Why are you still trying to pester us?

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.150
Such a small sum of money is not enough.

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.960
Do you know how hard it is

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.800
to make tofu?

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.800
You can't leave!

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.600
That's right.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.110
Mr. Hu, stop moving around.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.340
Let me carry this stuff there for you.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:14.650
What's that noise?

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:16.370
It seems to be coming from the tea house.

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:17.770
Let's go check it out now.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.360
Isn't this Yang Yitang?

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.200
Did you two see that?

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.940
A thief tried to attack me.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.700
You ungrateful scoundrel!

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.400
We usually treat you as an honored guest

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.320
and provide you
with the best food and drinks.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.030
I can't believe
you turn out to be a thief.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.510
Tell me!

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.710
Why did you sneakily

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.570
follow us here?

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:48.910
Could it be that you want to steal

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.070
the Rong family's tea-making methods?

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.280
Lady Shanbao, I'm innocent.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:52.960
Help!

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.440
How dare you still tell lies?

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.990
Xiangling, stop it!

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.590
I... I followed Mr. Lu

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.230
in here.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.480
Everyone in this mansion is saying

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:06.320
Lady Rong Shanbao has allowed him
to pay respects at the ancestral hall

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.150
and complete the wedding ceremony.

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.320
It's such wonderful news.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.380
I... I was going to congratulate him.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.590
But I saw him change into casual clothes,

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.800
avoid people
and sneak around suspiciously,

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.920
so I followed him in here.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:15.550
You're still lying?

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.920
Lady Shanbao, if you don't believe it,

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.230
ask Mr. Lu to come over here.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.440
I'm willing to confront him face to face.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.190
Just ask him to come over here.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.320
Then you'll know the truth.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.400
Heaven is watching above us.

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.070
If anything I've said is untrue,

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.930
just let that lightning
strike half of my body down.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.550
Do you know this trick

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.060
has been used by someone else before?

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.280
Why on earth

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.150
did you follow him here?

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.360
My...

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.670
My... My cousin was perfectly fine

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.060
when he entered the Rong Mansion.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.960
Then he died
and was carried back home on a board.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.800
After that, the elders sent me here,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800
hoping that I could accomplish something.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.320
Last time, a woman visited the house
and claimed to be a relative.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.880
I thought

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.680
Mr. Lu was keeping someone here.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.150
I expected to get something on him

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.550
so that I could threaten him.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.510
But unexpectedly,

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.840
I offended Lady Rong Shanbao.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.090
What are you talking about?

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.300
You're talking nonsense.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.960
I think you've lost your mind.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.590
Mr. Hu has been working on
pan-frying tea leaves

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.980
in our plantations for 30 years.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.340
He unfortunately injured his leg.

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:19.600
I accompanied Shanbao here to visit him.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.710
Amazing!

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.440
No matter how many plasters I used,
it wasn't effective.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.230
Thankfully, Lady Shanbao brought me

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.860
the prescription from the Baohe Hall.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.190
It's really effective.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.610
Look at this leg.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.990
I can even walk a few steps
without any pain now.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.800
In this way,

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.830
it won't hinder me
from pan-frying tea leaves.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.910
I'm glad it's effective.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.190
Lady Shanbao,
we've searched the entire courtyard

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.960
and found no outsiders.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.150
The footprints on the low wall

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.880
belong to just one person, too.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.800
You shameless liar!

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:47.350
What else can you say now?

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.000
I saw him enter the alley
with my own eyes.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.400
He must have been trying to mislead us.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.920
Lady Shanbao, if you hurry back now,

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.050
I'm sure you can catch him red-handed.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:01.120
Go!

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.230
[Rong Mansion]

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.480
Those dragon-and-phoenix

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.510
and marital-harmony patterns
are too vulgar.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.260
It's better
to choose the Magnolia patterns.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.030
Let's also not waste

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.050
that pair of phoenixes
you've carefully drawn.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.220
Make them into shoe uppers.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.320
I'm sure Lady Shanbao will be pleased.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.110
I got it.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.530
Thank you for your guidance, Young Master.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.320
If you want to use flowers,

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.650
why not choose peonies?

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.480
That would symbolize
wealth and prosperity.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.880
It must not be too vulgar.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.400
Okay. I got it.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.630
Alright.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.200
Fortunately,
I didn't go in there recklessly.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.330
It was indeed a trap.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.780
[West Lake Longjing Tea]

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.400
I've already asked people

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.960
to urgently transfer tea leaves
from the prefectures and counties

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.020
that are unaffected by the disaster.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.670
However,
the Longjing tea leaves produced elsewhere

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.600
are not as good as those from Linji.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.070
Yunxi, I'd like to ask you

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:35.860
to visit our old customers one by one

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:36.750
and discuss

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.360
how to make up
for this year's autumn tea leaves first.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.230
We absolutely cannot
damage the Rong family's reputation.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.350
