(full of doubts)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.680
(will all be reopened for retrial.)

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.120
(If you hadn't persisted until now,)

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.639
(many injustices would never
have seen the light of day.)

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800
(This case is not only for my brother,)

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:46.519
(nor only for me,)

(You did it.)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.959
(Both Li Fuyuan and Li Yuan'er)

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:01.639
are now without regrets.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.760
It's all over.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.119
It's time to think of our own matters.

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.180
Let's pick an auspicious day

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.440
and hold again

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:19.520
a lively wedding banquet.

From now on,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.000

together

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.919
we'll renovate this courtyard again

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.160
and plant some plants.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.960
Holding a private trial

Mr. Cui.

All the old case files are here.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.519
Everyone.

00:07:34.799 --> 00:07:35.640
Thank you for waiting.

00:08:19.359 --> 00:08:20.480
You're back.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.359
Master.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.119
Do you understand what it means
to "perish when meeting a stone"?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.760
After leaving the mountain,

00:08:27.119 --> 00:08:29.359
I indeed encountered
the person you mentioned

00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:30.839
that's relevant to "stone".

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.559
Every time I see him,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.760
I feel a bit uneasy.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.039
I thought I would die by his hand,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.000
but unexpectedly,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.119
just seeing the stone marrow he wears

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.320
reminds me of my brother in prison,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.400
having his fingers broken

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.359
and tongue cut off.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.119
That's why the pain is so unbearable.

00:08:51.599 --> 00:08:52.880
Thank you for your guidance.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:56.359
I realize now what you said

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.400
was not a prophecy or curse,

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.239
but a lesson
on how I should act in the end.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.159
If my actions

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.559
involve him,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.799
he would fail as a county magistrate

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.440
seeking justice for the people.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:10.239
Dying by his hand

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.799
is the best outcome.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.799
"Perish when meeting a stone"
doesn't mean death is fixed.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:20.760
Heaven and earth are one;
life and death are intertwined.

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:22.919
The stone is a trial,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.280
a barrier,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.640
a turning of energy.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.679
If you cling to obsession,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.359
death is real.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.400
If you go with the flow,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.400
death may mark a new beginning.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.000
People think
I transformed into a celestial being,

00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:41.359
but I just used an illusion to escape.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:46.760
You said before that all of this is just
the beginning of a long journey.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.799
So this is what you meant.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.520
(Now I understand)

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.119
(death is the end of the setup.)

00:09:56.359 --> 00:09:57.239
(Living)

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:59.159
(is the beginning of the solution.)

00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:02.787
(One Month Later)

00:10:03.479 --> 00:10:06.440

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.760
Come take a look
at folding fans and bead baskets.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.640
Aged wine.

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.679
Which lady is that for?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.280
Don't even mention it.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.719
It was returned when I gave it away.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.400
Where are you going?

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.119
I got a few seeds.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.880
I'm going back to the courtyard
to plant some melons for my wife.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.039
(Tea)
The book says,

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:42.559
"There's a tale of the thrush
with seven lives, astonishing all."

00:10:42.719 --> 00:10:45.239
The world will always see bright days.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.840
Keep a loyal heart and let it guide you.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.280
We have all kinds of silks and fabrics.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.679
Miss, come take a look.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.679
New rouge and powders.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.320
These are the latest styles
from the capital.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.250
I'll take a few of each.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.520
Thank you.

00:11:12.637 --> 00:11:22.600
