=To Kill a Songbird=

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.425
(Adapted from Shen Xiaoguan's
Bird Kills Seven People)

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:14.325
=Episode 19=
(How to Foresee A Bird Killer?)

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.879
So,

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:20.040
that is how you intend to do this.

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:21.279
Very well.

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:23.720
The young are truly formidable.

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.959
But...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.599
A weight has been lifted off my chest.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.360
You knew we would act today,

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:39.400
so you deliberately...

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.639
You want us to reveal our cards.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.800
What a clever lady.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.599
So you're striking now

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.199
to...

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.959
Exactly.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.040
As long as everyone here dies,

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:57.680
no one will gossip again.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.839
Official Liang.

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:59.680
You can't...

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.319
Murder.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.479
He's dead.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.199
There's no hurry.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.279
One by one.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.839
Take it slow.

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.880
But I must thank you, Miss Li.

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.080
Your thrush illusion

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.320
is famous in Huachang County.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.039
So these people dying

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.399
under your uncontrolled illusion

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240
isn't exactly strange.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.839
Don't you agree?

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:44.279
I'm here.

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.720
You...

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.720
(I knew you wouldn't involve me.)

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.399
(How could I not be alert?)

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.160
(Bound as husband and wife,)

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.279
(we share life and death.)

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.919
(At a time like this,)

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:00.800
(don't think of abandoning
the husband you just wed.)

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:02.759
Do you think

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.639
I'm a villain?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.720
I was born a commoner

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.839
with no ancestral protection,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.199
nor noble patronage.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.399
If I followed the rules,

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.759
serving as a minor county magistrate,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.320
how long until I get promoted?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.960
How long to help more people?

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.199
After leaving
and taking office elsewhere,

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.559
how many achievements did I gain?

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.800
How many people

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.000
truly thanked me as their magistrate?

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:38.479
How many

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.800
capable officials without backing
did I promote?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.559
How much did I do
for this overstaffed court?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.960
Did you ever know?

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.080
Yet now you condemn my past mistakes.

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.360
Aren't you shortsighted?

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.520
A fine couple.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.039
What a pity.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.360
A bright moon over a gutter.

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:05.440
You're like Li Ji.

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.639
You lack that fortune.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.119
Kill them.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.119
The evidence is here.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.650
(Master Jiang.)

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.480
(Liang Andao knows I learned the truth.)

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.990
(Leave the city as per your plan
and lure out the hidden scouts.)

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.519
(Then help me find one person)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.679
(as my final gamble.)

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.959
Tell them

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.000
who you are.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:33.640
My surname is Huang.

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:36.440
I'm Inspecting Envoy Zhai Lu's wife.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.040
Liang Andao.

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:40.839
You captured me and my children.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.239
You forced my husband to die for you

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.839
and planned to kill us all.

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:49.359
How vicious.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:51.679
I have household records.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.160
My identity can be verified.

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.079
Liang traitor, what can you say now?

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.440
This is your so called evidence?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.160
The evidence is here.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.160
(Mr. Cui San.)

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.760
(You know the truth best.)

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.959
(This chance is rare.)

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.040
(I ask you to feign death)

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.959
(to help expose this darkness.)

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.000
This letter

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.440
was taken from a hidden compartment
in Fan Jili's home.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.519
It's the anonymous letter you used

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.320
to have him
slander Li Ji and fabricate evidence.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:32.519
You guard gentlemen
but not against villains.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.119
You invited Fan Jili to the wedding

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:37.600
to silence him as well.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.279
And if I went to his house,

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:44.279
his family would naturally hand
his lifesaving trump card over to me .

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.959
Though this happened over ten years ago,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.880
the incident was sudden back then.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.990
There was no time to find someone
to write this letter.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.920
This handwriting

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.279
is yours.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.200
The proof is right here.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.399
(Mrs. Shen.)

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.279
(Yexin and Huiyi are with me.)

00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:04.590
(Their lives may be in danger.)

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.880
(I've verified Liang Andao's men.)

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.679
(They're all mountain bandits.)

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:11.799
(They only want payment.)

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.600
(Now,)

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.320
(you may reunite with your two sons.)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.440
This is my husband Shen Xiu's real head

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.119
and Zhao Chengxi's confession letter.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:32.160
It details how you once ordered him

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.559
and the Huang brothers
to kill Li Ji through Shen Xiu.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.920
It was written back then
for self protection

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:41.440
and hidden in the tree hollow
with the body.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.720
Official Liang.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.000
This evidence
cannot be called unreliable, right?

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.000
We must thank Zhai Lu for this.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.359
If he hadn't deliberately reminded us,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.720
we would never have thought

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.880
of that thrush.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:58.799
Unexpectedly,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.559
the little thrush

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:02.880
we released back then

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.279
turned out to be

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.799
the key to breaking the case.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.839
That Mofeibai was my husband Xiu's bird

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.079
for many years.

00:07:11.359 --> 00:07:12.480
It knew the way home,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.760
so it flew back on its own
after the murder.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.559
Since it knew the way home,

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:18.880
it wasn't hard to find the crime scene.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.839
Though the head had turned to bone,

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.279
unexpectedly,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.760
the letter was intact.

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:27.839
It's a miracle, or perhaps fate.

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:29.720
Even so,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.519
I could kill you all.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.640
Let's see who could convict me.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.279
Liang Andao.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.600
Official Liang.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.600
You're the imperial censor,
patrolling on behalf of heaven.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.760
Local officials cannot judge you.

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:51.399
But I, Vice Censor-in-Chief,

00:07:51.799 --> 00:07:54.679
should still be able to question you

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.600
and take charge of this matter.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.519
You fell off a cliff days ago

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:02.640
and alarmed Master Lu.

00:08:02.799 --> 00:08:04.920
He insisted
I urge Official Liang to come.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:08.839
Official Liang,
you worked with Official Cen for years.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.679
You must have recognized him long ago

00:08:10.799 --> 00:08:11.959
and thus had misgivings.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.359
Otherwise,
Master Lu and I would be dead.

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:16.600
Because you feared Official Cen

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.359
and knew this couldn't be ended lightly,

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.200
you coerced Zhai Lu

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.959
to take the blame and close the case.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.559
I've reviewed
all evidence Jiang Chun sent.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.839
I have also detained your men.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.799
So be it.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.320
Didn't you...

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:42.440
Didn't I already leave?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:45.000
That's because someone

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.640
stopped me halfway

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.799
and told me the whole truth.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:50.440
Sorry.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.790
I couldn't tell you
the truth this morning.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.520
Why do you smell so strongly of dew?

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.880
I slept poorly last night

00:08:57.359 --> 00:08:58.359
and went out for a walk.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.919
I was the one
who invited Official Cen back.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.679
I lost.

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:10.799
- But I don't...
- You don't understand how?

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:14.200
Please enlighten me.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.080
Official Liang once asked Zhai Lu

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.200
where the minor official

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.440
who spoke for the people went.

00:09:21.719 --> 00:09:22.559
Official Liang.

00:09:23.239 --> 00:09:25.280
Were you not also speaking of yourself?

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:27.280
Now that you have become this,

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:30.239
how will you face
your wife and children?

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:31.320
Sir.

00:09:31.559 --> 00:09:33.640
You shouldn't ask me how.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.080
The official world is unstable.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.840
Pure and tainted are one.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.520
The career path is perilous.

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:44.159
It's not yet time for you to understand.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.039
Official Liang.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.559
We could have avoided pursuit

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:51.400
by hiding our tracks

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.000
and avoided this disaster.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.719
But we all came back anyway

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.080
and took part in this.

00:09:57.239 --> 00:09:59.479
Do you know why?

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:01.440
If you don't remember,

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll tell you a case.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.799
In the first year of Chongning,
a wealthy household was robbed.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
An old man was named as the culprit.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.400
He was flogged 40 times

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.000
and died in the courtroom.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.479
There was no solid physical evidence.

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:18.090
Neighbors only claimed
he got rich suddenly

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.580
and bought several jars of fine wine.

00:10:19.599 --> 00:10:21.559
They declared him guilty of theft.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.280
His son was originally a coroner.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.359
Due to this case, he could no longer
serve at the magistrate's office.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.159
With no other methods to make a living,

00:10:31.599 --> 00:10:34.599
he buried his father
and jumped into the river that night.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.039
Sir.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.880
That young coroner was my predecessor.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.760
This case was doubtful, was it not?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.520
Official Liang.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:46.039
I also have a case.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.200
There was a scholar surnamed Shen

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.880
who argued with someone
and pushed him by accident.

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.559
Unexpectedly, that person

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:54.119
mysteriously died that evening.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.919
The scholar was thus convicted

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.479
and thrown into prison,

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.919
where he soon died of illness.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.840
This scholar surnamed Shen

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.200
was my father-in-law.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:06.200
Because of his crime,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.440
my husband Shen Xiu lost the qualification
for the provincial exam

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.400
and made a living
by raising birds from then on.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.280
This case is questionable,

00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:16.080
was it not?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.320
Sir.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.799
These two cases

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
were all recorded
by Li Ji in the petition.

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:23.119
48 case files.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.200
48 sentences
stating "this case is doubtful."

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.840
When you read them back then,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.840
did you feel any awe

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.960
or a hint of guilt?

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.719
You have probably forgotten by now

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.239
what Li Ji wished to tell you

00:11:37.599 --> 00:11:39.559
behind these case files.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.039
Today, I wish to

00:11:42.599 --> 00:11:44.359
say it to you once again.

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:50.479
There are three essentials
in legal matters.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.159
First, evidence must be solid.

00:11:52.479 --> 00:11:53.640
Solid means

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:56.159
there must be verification
by two or more people.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.039
(Second, verify carefully
at the appointed time.)

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.960
(With multiple people present,)

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.239
(examine the terrain)

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:03.840
(and record it properly.)

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.799
(Use written, oral, and case records.)

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.719
(These form the three records.)

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:16.640
Yet the essence of judgment
lies in the people, in the common folk,

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.200
and depends on justice and fairness,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.960
not on merit or fame.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.719
I heard that you

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.559
were once a good official
who petitioned for the people.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.880
May you never forget
your original intent.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.440
(Petition to Official Liang Andao)
Reflect on old ambitions.

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:40.000
Hence this petition today.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.239
I hope you review old cases,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.359
redress the wrongs,
and separate the pure from the corrupt.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.159
Serve the people for the people,
and uphold the name of Justice.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.640
You may not wish to be this clear wind,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.679
but there will always be
someone who does.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.679
And someone will always remember

00:12:59.159 --> 00:13:00.400
what he has done

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:03.159
and the paths he has taken.

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:06.125
(Pure And Righteous Mind)

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:06.919
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
(Official Liang.)

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.200
(Each word of this petition)

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.359
(Pure And Righteous Mind)
(expresses my concern.)

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:15.119
(I earnestly request
you take time to read it.)

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.200
(If you accept a suggestion or two,)

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.479
(Petition to Official Liang Andao)
(it will be a blessing to all.)

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:23.359
(And I will have no regrets.)

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.599
Don't blame the clear wind
for dispelling my filth.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.799
Li Ji.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.000
