00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
What gives you the right
to fire my employees however you please?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.760
You're the one
who gave me full authority

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.440
to make decisions in this company.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.360
Didn't you say Din would be out by now?!

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.040
I didn't think he'd flip the game
and turn sales around like that.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.000
Stop wasting time with excuses.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.560
Just kick him out directly.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.080
I'm so happy!

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.720
Hey, hey, careful.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.680
You're drunk. You're gonna fall.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.720
I'm not. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.040
If you don't believe me,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.320
look at me up close.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.120
If you're going to bed,
I'll turn off the lights.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.480
You're not sleeping?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.080
I still have work to finish.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.680
Then I'll get back to it.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.760
What do I do now?

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.280
Sarah, you idiot.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.240
What…

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.400
What did you do?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.560
I must've been really drunk.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.280
Wait.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.520
Was I that drunk?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.480
Hey. No, no, no.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.520
I was drunk. I was definitely drunk.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.120
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.360
I was drunk. So drunk.
You were drunk, Sarah.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.840
Din.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.200
Din, wake up. It's morning.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.640
Huh?

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.480
Yo?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.160
Why are you sleeping out here?

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.840
And why are you in here?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.160
I came to get something yesterday
and forgot my iPad.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.880
So…

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.960
Why are you sleeping here?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.840
Did you fight with your wife

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.400
and get kicked out of the room?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.440
Am I right?

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.080
Of course not.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.360
I was working. There's a lot to do. See?

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.440
Today's meeting

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.480
is to acknowledge and appreciate

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.440
the significant rise in sales.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.160
Yes, our sales

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.200
have hit a record high

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.560
and brought hope back to the company.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.200
Even though sales are good,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.720
I still think this company needs a change

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.720
to move in a new direction.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.840
What do you mean?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.600
I propose we replace the CEO

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.560
to align with the company's new policy.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.920
What gives you the authority to remove me?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.840
If I don't resign,
the shareholders have to vote.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.720
Or do you think

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.960
you have enough shares to push me out?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.160
Then take a look for yourself.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.040
Ms. Namnuan

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.840
has sold all her shares

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.120
to Mr. Praphop.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.680
And here's
the shareholder transfer contract.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.560
PD GROUP SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.080
Why would you betray me?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.040
I'm just looking out for myself.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.520
You never succeed at anything.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.120
You couldn't even get Nam to marry Nina.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.320
And you run the company terribly.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.760
So, I had to do this.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.240
But things were finally getting better.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.800
"Getting better"
doesn't mean they'll stay better.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.320
Selling the shares
while people still think it has a future

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.400
is better than waiting for the fall.
I won't take that risk.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.240
How long have you been doing this?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.640
-Doing what?
-Playing both sides.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.160
I've always wondered

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.240
how the words from when
I advanced that money to help Eyes

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.480
got to Chakrit.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.680
I think I know now.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.760
Hope this helps you.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.480
Do whatever you want with it.
Just make sure

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.440
my salary and benefits

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.120
stay the same.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.920
You run the entire accounting department.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.280
Details about money
only leak from one place.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.120
I actually suspected it at first,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.040
but I told myself…

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.920
you're my mother,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.160
and I'm your son.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.760
Even if you didn't love me
like your real child, I never thought

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.080
you'd do this to me.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.960
People have to put themselves first.
That's just how it is.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.400
Are you okay?

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.760
It's alright.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.640
How could you do that to Din?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.360
Don't raise your voice at me.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.520
I'm only here to tell you

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.720
that you have to vote
for Mr. Praphop's side. That's an order.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.880
So, you actually want Din
out of his position?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.480
Can't be helped. That's their condition.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.760
But he's my brother.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.120
And I'm your real mother.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.280
I already promised Mr. Praphop.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.920
He'll take care of the debt we owe him,
including my personal debt.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.520
If I don't do this, I'll get in trouble.
Is that what you want?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.640
That's how it is.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.040
All I can do is listen.
The decision is yours.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.280
Just having someone to talk to
makes me feel a lot better already.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.640
Right now, I feel like I'm on my own.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.680
One side is my brother.
The other side is my mother.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.000
I don't know who to choose.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.520
You're not alone.
I told you I'm here to listen.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.800
Then why'd you flick my forehead?
That hurt!

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.720
See? You're not down anymore.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.120
Just thinking about facing Chakrit

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.040
already drains me.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.240
Don't give up yet.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.600
I told you there's always a way.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.320
Hello, Baicha. What is it?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.160
Sorry, I'm late, Baicha.
I had urgent documents to sign.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.080
It's fine. I already know everything.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.480
So, I'll get straight to the point.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.840
About…

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.960
These are my PD Group shares.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.000
Over the years, I've bought quite a lot.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.800
If we combine them with yours

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.960
and the minor shareholders',

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.680
I think we can beat Mr. Praphop.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.040
Thanks for helping me out, Baicha.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.280
I do have one condition though.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.720
What condition?

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.760
You have to divorce Ms. Sarah.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.520
Baicha.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.600
Her offer is reasonable.
It solves everything neatly.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.760
You keep your position, and I…

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.960
I complete my duty.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.840
We'll talk later.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.720
But this offer benefits everyone.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.120
Are you going to let your father's company
fall into someone else's hands?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.040
I said we'll talk later.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.360
You don't have any other options.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.320
At this rate, you'll lose the vote.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.680
If it helps you win, I'm fine with it.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.400
Thanks for helping me out, Baicha.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.359
I do have one condition though.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.200
You have to divorce Ms. Sarah.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.040
I'm sorry, Din. I really am.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.400
I just don't want to lose you.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.800
As you've seen, Mr. Phong,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.600
our gift set is trending everywhere.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.840
Sales are shooting up every day.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.120
I hope that as a shareholder…

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.960
Hello, Mr. Soranut.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.360
I'm sure you've heard
about the upcoming CEO vote.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.280
Is that so, Mr. Weerapol?

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.960
I've been doing my best.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.280
And now we're seeing light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.800
The gift set is really taking off.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.920
And I'm more than ready

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.800
to continue leading the company
and taking care of this product line.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.000
If we replace the CEO now,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.480
there's no guarantee
Mr. Chakrit can perform better than me.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160
You're back late.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.280
I've been talking to the shareholders.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.680
Just divorce me.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.440
Why are you holding on?

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.160
All it takes is a signature,
and everything is resolved.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.520
I know.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.440
Then why?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.200
Because I'm trying not to let it end.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.320
Why bother?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.120
Our marriage

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.920
was for our mutual benefit from the start.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.240
You did it for yourself. For the company.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.120
Or do you want to hand over
your power to someone else?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.280
I don't like people
taking advantage of me. Okay?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.560
No, it's not.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.880
Because you took advantage
of me too when I was desperate.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.560
Otherwise, how would
this marriage even exist?

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.960
-Yes, but…
-There is no "but".

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.800
Let's just get a divorce.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.440
If not, you'll lose everything.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.360
But I don't want to lose…

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.440
Anyway, I'll handle it.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.360
Mind your own business.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.080
Why are you so stubborn?

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.640
Are you really that afraid of losing face?

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.320
You think I'm that kind of man?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.880
Do you really think that?

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.360
What's the matter?

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.160
You should know.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.120
Din.

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.960
I think you should give up.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.680
Just step down as CEO, that's all.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.440
You'll still keep your shares.
I'm the one who sold everything.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.600
Let it go already.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.480
I think the one clinging on is you, Mom.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.440
You're clinging to your own comfort.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.520
You only care about the perks. You don't
even care who built this company.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.720
Look at Dad's picture.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920
Look at his face.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.920
And tell me what you did was right.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.160
Alright!

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.280
I was wrong.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.520
But I did my best.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.360
Your best?

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.520
By helping others take over
the company Dad built?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.920
If I ran it poorly and it went under,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.320
I wouldn't complain.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.600
But we're recovering, and you push me out.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.920
How much do we owe Mr. Praphop?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.640
If I don't get rid of you, will I survive?

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520
I know

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.800
that you never loved me.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.520
You never treated me like a son
the way you did Nam or Yo.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.120
But I never thought…

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.640
you could be this cruel to me.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.280
Cruel?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.680
You don't know
what I've had to go through.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.840
If I were truly cruel to you,
you wouldn't have made it this far.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.960
If you knew what your father did to me,

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.520
you'd thank me for raising you!

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.520
As for the CEO position,
you'll lose it either way.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.680
I've already arranged a comfortable exit.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.480
Whether you accept it or not is up to you.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.520
Right now, we hold 27% of the shares.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.440
Din has 20%.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.360
And?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.760
He's gathering shareholders' votes.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.080
He might get it up to 25.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:21.840
Not bad.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.560
Still talking big?
Soon, he'll have more than us.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.960
Then let him.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.520
Let him charm whoever he can.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.040
And if he actually gathers them all,

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.080
we'll be the losers.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.600
I'm not underestimating him,
but most of the shares

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.560
are tied up with Nam

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.680
and Wayo.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.000
-And?
-Wayo is his mama's boy.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.960
If we can control Namnuan,
we control Wayo.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.800
As for your beloved Nam,

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.000
who knows where he is now.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.520
Even if he's here,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.800
with that sibling rivalry going on,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.680
he won't help his brother.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.080
I'm begging you, Mr. Nop.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.560
It's not that I don't sympathize with you,
but I'm close with Mr. Praphop.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.320
We've known each other a long time.
I don't want to ruin our relationship.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.640
I'm sorry.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.720
Wait, Mr. Nop. Mr. Nop.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.160
The shop's still open as usual.
Please come support us.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.720
But I haven't been live much lately,
and I haven't posted videos.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.040
Don't forget me. Love you all, mwah!

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.160
DIN

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.080
So, can we talk now?

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.920
If there's anything, just say it.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.760
BAICHA

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.720
I'll be straightforward with you.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.960
I want to ask you to vote for Mr. Din.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.680
I want him to stay on
as CEO of the company.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.560
And what will I get?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.800
I'll divorce Mr. Din,

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.360
just like you asked.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.680
Are you sure
you really want to divorce Din?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.160
If you promise,
I will definitely get the divorce.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.640
So, you don't love Din at all?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.600
You're divorcing him so easily.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.400
I'll answer honestly.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.720
I don't know

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.560
how I feel about him.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.600
I only know

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.680
that Din is important to me.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.160
I don't want to see him hurt.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.360
I know the company means a lot to him.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.240
And me divorcing him…

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.680
is my way of doing something for him.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.720
Then go get the divorce first.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.720
Or have Din confirm

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.360
he will divorce you for real.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.680
Only then will I promise to help.

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.640
But it won't be in time.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.720
That's your problem, not mine.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.160
Din, did you hear everything?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.000
I heard.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.560
Congratulations.
Ms. Sarah did this for you.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.560
Thanks, Baicha.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.560
So now, it's only up to you.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.920
Will you accept my proposal?

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.880
No.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.480
I will never divorce her.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.600
Even if you have to lose everything?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.480
Even if I lose everything,

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.760
I'll still have Sara.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.200
Okay.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.960
I understand now.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.120
Thank you.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.880
What's wrong?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.480
I've lost, Nam.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.520
I've lost…

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.080
There's nothing I can do anymore.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.920
It's alright, it's alright. It's okay.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.400
Good evening, Mr. Arun.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.840
Mr. Din, you're hanging out here too?

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.480
No, not really.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.240
I actually came to see you, Mr. Arun.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.640
I couldn't get hold of you,
so I checked with the secretary.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.320
She said you were hanging out here.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.280
So, I came by.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.360
Mr. Arun's a VIP here.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.160
You did your homework well.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:23.520
But you're a bit late.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.640
Mr. Arun.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.040
As promised.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.880
Please enjoy.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.640
Go.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.760
Alright.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.360
I really like this.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.160
Come on, girls.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.600
Let's go have fun inside.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.240
-Daddy.
-Yeah.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.400
What are your names?

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.400
Sorry about that, Din.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.920
But you're a bit late.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.960
I'm just not one
for opportunists like you.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.400
Whatever it takes, I don't care.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.480
If I can get what your father
stole from mine back,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.480
I'll be satisfied.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:08.880
How long have you been
going on about this?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.520
It's obvious

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.520
that your father misused company funds.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.400
If my dad hadn't forced him to sell
shares, the company would've collapsed.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.920
I don't buy your fairy tales.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.560
It won't be long.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.360
-You won't make it.
-If I don't make it,

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.720
it won't be because of you.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.320
You can't do anything to me.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.480
The real winner will be Uncle Praphop.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.880
You're just a pawn.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.600
And that talk about
getting everything back, in the end,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.400
you won't get anything either.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.880
If I get to watch
you people crash and burn,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.680
that alone

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.440
is satisfying enough.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.840
Ms. Sarah did so much for Din.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.920
But he still won't let go.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.880
They didn't marry for money, did they?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.040
You really think so?

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.960
There, there, stop crying.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.480
It's getting too loud.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.720
So… Why did you come back?

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.120
Because of your email.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.760
You sent it to me like that
and you're still asking?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.480
So, what now with Din?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.000
Good afternoon, sir.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.320
Is the office too small?

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.960
Get ready to move into the CEO office.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.760
If it weren't for your backing,
I wouldn't be here.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.960
There's just one step left.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.160
Once the vote's done,
everything will be official.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.640
That matter

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.760
is no longer an issue.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.560
What's important

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.200
is what comes next.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.200
So, don't worry, sir.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.520
Anything profitable, I'll keep doing.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.440
Like that gift set
Din worked so hard to make popular.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.760
I won't touch it.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.000
But the one behind it must be removed,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.200
so we won't have to look
over our shoulders.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.120
Good, very good.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.200
That's what I want.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.600
And remember this.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.080
What's hard to gain is harder to keep.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.160
Yes, sir.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.360
It's time for the meeting.
Shareholders are all present.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.440
I'll be there soon.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.360
You can still call Ms. Baicha now.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.920
I told you,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.560
I won't divorce you.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.679
Mr. Din.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.480
The CEO post matters to you.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.920
You can't just give it up

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.760
when there's a way out like this.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.440
Just divorce me

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.840
and you'll be safe.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.120
You said you wouldn't leave me.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.000
No matter what happens.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.240
I won't leave you either.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.800
Sorry I'm late.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.880
It's alright.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.840
We've only just gathered,
not even five minutes ago.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.360
This meeting

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.320
is for shareholders only.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.640
You've sold all your shares.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:28.400
So, I'll have to ask you to step out, Mom.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.560
I'm here on Wayo's behalf.
Here's the authorization letter.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.760
Alright then.
Let's not waste any more time.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.720
Let's begin the voting.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.120
I'd like everyone

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.840
to cast your vote for whoever you support.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.800
Please go ahead.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.440
You're back.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.440
My brother's in trouble, isn't he?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.080
You know what's going on?

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.040
On a day like this,
how could I possibly miss it?

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.280
I'm not sure

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.400
why you hate your brother.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.080
But what I am sure of

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.840
is that your brother
did everything for the company.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.520
He did whatever it took for the company.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.080
So much that he didn't care
how anyone else felt.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.440
So, if he loses his position today,

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.520
it's only fair, isn't it?

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.800
You're not jealous of me.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.480
You're jealous of Sarach, you snake.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.360
I don't even want to imagine

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.920
that you could be this selfish.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.640
Even if I weren't,
you'd never choose me anyway.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.200
I thought
I was the only one who was allergic.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.920
I already checked.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.720
Our cream doesn't cause reactions.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.960
Even you, with your sensitive skin,
can use it just fine.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.440
Someone is sabotaging us.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.120
