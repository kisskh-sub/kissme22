00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
My name is Zhang Shan.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.680
I am 28 years old.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.359
I graduated from Stanford University.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.200
Majoring in finance.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.599
My specialty is...

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.640
Stanford University.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.439
Right.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.239
Then explain...

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:21.799
the basic principles of the...

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.280
Black-Scholes option pricing model.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.599
Brian what?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.040
Graduated from the Chinese department.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.200
Yes, President Qin.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.280
I have worked as a secretary...

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.879
at several Fortune 500 companies.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.000
I have extensive experience.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.040
I have memorized the list of all...

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.120
past...

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.200
My specialty is being time-sensitive.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.200
From the moment you entered the room...

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
how many seconds have passed?

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.479
Boss...

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.199
You forgot to have them take off their clothes.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.120
I'll call them back now.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.159
That won't be necessary, Secretary Lin.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.000
None of them are qualified.

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.039
Careful!

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.400
Sit down.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.360
I'll get an ice pack.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.479
I've already booked you...

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.560
an appointment with a specialist at a nearby hospital.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.599
Please rest for a moment.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.840
I've already asked Lao Wang to send a car...

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.319
to take you to the hospital shortly.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.120
President Qin...

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.319
Are you...

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.240
unwilling for me to resign?

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.400
It seems Secretary Lin has truly...

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.439
learned the essence from me these past three years.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.360
Very self-righteous.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.680
I simply don't want...

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.599
after you leave...

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.319
my work to go undone, that's all.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.120
Then why are you giving them such a hard time, President Qin?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.879
President Qin...

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.360
Who's giving them a hard time?

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.400
I'm not giving them a hard time.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.919
Then are you giving *me* a hard time?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.800
Let me say it again.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.759
I am not giving anyone a hard time.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.560
They genuinely are not qualified.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.400
Then what are the full names...

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.080
of all the past Nobel Prize in Literature winners?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.479
I'm afraid you don't even know them yourself.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.560
Sully Prudhomme.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.719
Theodor Mommsen.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.840
Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.159
José Echegaray.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.560
Frédéric Mistral.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.759
Henryk Sienkiewicz.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:05.960
Giosuè Carducci.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.400
Rudyard Kipling.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.159
Shall I continue?

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.639
Alright, boss.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.839
I will continue to work hard...

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.079
to find you a new secretary.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.600
But whether you accept it or not...

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.639
I will still resign one month from now.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:38.240
Did you order the milk tea?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.040
Yes.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.399
Thank you.

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.240
Keep the change.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.279
She's the one.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.639
My new secretary.

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:48.319
Within one month...

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.680
train her to be as capable as you.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.519
But President Qin...

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:53.199
She's not here for an interview.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:54.480
She's just from the milk tea shop downstairs...

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.279
delivering an order.

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.800
It doesn't matter.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.920
I like her.

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:58.560
But she's a woman.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.279
I think a male secretary is inconvenient.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.879
The new secretary must be a woman.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360
Is there a problem?

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:05.600
No problem.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.639
I'll get her up to speed as soon as possible.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.040
You don't need to go to the hospital with me.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.959
I'll go myself.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.120
You take this...

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.040
Qin Xue...

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.759
Xiao Xue...

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.000
and get her familiar with the work.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.720
Will this work?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.759
Cici...

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.480
Sorry to trouble you, but please help me entertain her.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.160
No problem.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.639
Then Ms. Qin, please come with us over here.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.439
Wait...

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.319
Who said I want to be a secretary?

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.279
Tonight, I'm going back to the Qin family home for dinner.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.639
You're coming with me.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.079
Yes, boss.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.199
Let's go, Lao Wang.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.480
Stop staring.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.600
I finally made it back for a visit.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.439
Let's eat.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.560
What do you mean?

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.240
It's precisely because you're finally back...

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.360
that I want to look at you a bit more.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:59.759
How has the company been...

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.680
lately?

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.480
Very well.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.439
Except for expanding into overseas markets...

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:08.680
some shareholders opposed it.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.720
President Qin has already handled it.

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.000
Well done.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.800
With you by her side...

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.920
I feel at ease.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.680
Dad...

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.040
No talking during meals, no speaking before bed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.800
Look...

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.639
It might be a sprained ankle.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.519
I'll go check.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.879
Ah, no need.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.959
You're finally here for a visit.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:29.759
Eat more.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:36.000
Secretary Lin

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.319
You're twenty-eight this year, right?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.079
Yes.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:39.560
I'll be twenty-eight after the New Year.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.560
What do you think of our Meili?

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.079
Young President Qin.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.560
She's very intelligent.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.720
And, as her name suggests,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.560
she's also very beautiful.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.800
One could say she's quite perfect.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.839
Of course.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.000
The daughter I raised,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.000
has had half my life's effort poured into her.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
So many people envy her.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.480
Both beautiful and capable,

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.720
and highly competent.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.800
It's just that

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:03.920
she doesn't want to get married.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.399
Secretary Lin doesn't seem to want to marry either, right?

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:08.959
You see,

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.639
neither of you wants to get married.

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.040
But Secretary Lin is outstanding.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.399
If he were to marry,

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:17.720
he'd have to find someone as perfect as our Meili.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.160
What are you saying?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.240
Nothing.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.680
I just mean that

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.879
we're not unenlightened parents.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.480
We never care about family background.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.759
As long as he's good to our Meili,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.240
you understand, right?

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:33.879
Secretary Lin.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:34.399
Yes?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.600
Here, have some food.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.080
Okay.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:36.879
Eat a bit more.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.240
My little princess.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.200
Mom.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.799
How have you been lately?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.919
Smoothly.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.679
At the company, I've basically already...

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.639
I'm not talking about work.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:52.639
Your love life.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.120
Is your love life going smoothly?

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.440
Is it?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440
What love life?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.799
I don't have any love life.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.440
Look at you.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:01.440
You won't accept blind dates,

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:02.840
so you should go out yourself

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.639
and explore the market more.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.600
You meet so many people

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.799
in your work and daily life.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:09.519
Is there not a single one you find pleasing?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.080
If you really can't,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.240
pay more attention to the people around you.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.240
Right? For example...

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.399
For example...

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.639
That tall guy is so handsome.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.440
Mom!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.600
I've already told you,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.559
we're not people who look down on the poor and fawn on the rich.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.720
You don't necessarily have to find someone

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.799
from a matching social status.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.799
As long as you two are compatible

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.679
and he treats you well.

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:31.799
Don't follow my example.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.080
You're already thirty,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.320
yet you're still acting like a child.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.960
Mom!

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:36.600
Twenty-nine!

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.840
Isn't that almost thirty?

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:39.759
And you're still not anxious?

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:40.240
Stop talking.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.559
You're driving me crazy.

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.200
I'm really not interested in men.

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:44.720
You're not interested in men?

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.360
Then are you...

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:48.720
Are you...

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.600
Mom, what are you thinking?!

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.480
How could that be?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.120
Of course,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.480
even if you were, it wouldn't matter.

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:56.360
I've already said,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.799
we're not unenlightened parents.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.480
Right?

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.879
Really.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:01.879
Mom...

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.360
Actually, I really do...

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.480
You...

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.480
You really like...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440
I'm teasing you, Mom!

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.279
How could that be?

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:18.480
My blood pressure just shot up.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:20.200
Don't mess around with me like this.

00:10:23.159 --> 00:10:24.360
I hit your leg.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.440
Don't try to scam me.

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:37.120
Go on home, Mom, Dad.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:38.639
Goodbye.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.360
That boy is really handsome.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.039
The key point is,

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:51.000
he's also quite capable.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.559
Secretary Lin, when are you getting married?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.559
Because some unexpected things happened,

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.559
so I'm not getting married for now.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.480
You got dumped, didn't you?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.519
Boss.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.480
That falls under my private affairs.

00:11:27.879 --> 00:11:28.600
It probably doesn't fall

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.080
under the category of things I need to report to you.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.320
Well, since you're not getting married,

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.759
why are you still resigning?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.320
Because I want to start a new chapter in my life.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.039
A new chapter?

00:11:42.279 --> 00:11:43.679
So, being with me

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:44.840
counts as the old chapter?

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:56.679
Secretary Lin.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.759
Let's get married.
