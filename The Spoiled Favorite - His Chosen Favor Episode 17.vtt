WEBVTT

00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:23.584
=His Chosen Favor=

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:26.912
(Consort Xi returned reborn
to claim my life)

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.768
=Episode 17=
Xiao Yicheng,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.960
I must save my child today.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.560
Whether you are willing or not,

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.920
this is not up to you!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.144
What's that on your chest?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.352
Let me go!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.080
This birthmark was unique
to the late emperor.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.320
Your Majesty,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.560
it really is you.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.760
You didn't die.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.360
None of your concern.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.400
Your Majesty,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.944
you admit it!

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.600
Then my unborn child

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.680
is yours.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.440
My child?

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.320
Chen Wanyi,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.320
you couldn't have your own child.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.120
What?

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.400
The sterility potion.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.360
You

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.840
could never bear your child.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.760
A sterility

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.960
potion?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.840
Why are you so cruel to me?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.920
Why did you sleep with me

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.240
as you said you love the late emperor?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.600
Chen Wanyi,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.920
your love is utterly disgusting.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.760
Your Majesty!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.280
Your Majesty!

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.200
Being playful again.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.760
Your Highness, this is the calming tea.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.960
Have a cup

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.920
and you'll sleep well.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.120
This tea tastes strange.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.440
It always tastes like this.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.000
Rest now.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.880
Everything will be better
when you wake up.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.040
Lu Zhen'er, you witch!

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560
Give me back my life!

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.720
Return my life!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.768
Your Highness.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.680
What's wrong?

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.880
Yindan, I...

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.720
I dreamed

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.480
of Consort Xi.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.520
Consort Xi?

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.080
Your Highness,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.920
what's wrong?

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.920
Your Highness!

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.720
Someone!

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.720
Come here!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.520
Your Majesty,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.160
Consort Lu isn't ill.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.400
She's been poisoned.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.080
Poisoned?

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.920
Yes.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.080
The poison is Seven Days Doom.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.680
It won't kill immediately,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.720
but takes seven days.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.880
Without taking the antidote
in seven days,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.360
Her Highness will die.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.120
Taking the antidote before then,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.520
she'll be alright.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.000
Do you have the antidote?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.240
I lack the skill.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.040
Sir, you may leave.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400
Yes.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.760
The Zichen Hall is sealed tight.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.160
How could she be poisoned?

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.760
It was my oversight.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.800
Please forgive me.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.040
This has nothing to do with her.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.160
Don't blame her!

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.120
I don't think so.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.864
Yindan,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.000
stand up.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.320
Yindan, please leave us.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.080
Yes.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.960
Stop suspecting Yindan.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.720
Everyone in this hall answers to me,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.960
except her.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.000
It can't be her.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.040
Lu Zhen'er,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.280
you trust her that much?

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.640
If she harmed me,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.120
I'd willingly accept it.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.680
But I think it isn't her.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.760
Because

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.760
I had a strange dream last night

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.560
that Consort Xi demanded I pay
with my life.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.040
She choked me.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.680
Look,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.000
strangulation marks on my neck!

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.800
The poisoner

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.520
is Consort Xi's spirit?

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.960
No.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.640
I think

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.320
someone is using her name

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.760
to kill me.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.120
Rest assured.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.320
It's so cold tonight.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.960
This palace is so eerie.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.720
Consort Xi!

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.560
How dare you!

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.640
Bow before me!

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.480
- Ghost!
- Ghost!

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.880
A ghost!

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.680
(Lu Zhen'er, I'm back for revenge.)

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440
The Zichen Hall is magnificent.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.600
I wish to reside here.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.520
I wish to be with His Majesty forever.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.680
It's all your fault!

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.440
All your fault!

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.240
Pay with your life!

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.280
Are you alright?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.680
Again I dreamed

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.320
of Consort Xi.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.160
Your Majesty, word of ghosts
has been going around lately.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.120
They claimed to have seen Consort Xi.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.160
Could it really be...

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.000
I've never believed
in ghosts or spirits.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.208
But there are

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.440
only three days left.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.680
Have you heard?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.360
Yes. Consort Xi has come back to life.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.800
She's come for Consort Lu's life.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800
Consort Lu was poisoned.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.880
Won't live past seven days.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.760
Won't live past seven days?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.720
Don't spread rumors.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.760
Stop it!

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.680
Let's go!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.880
Tomorrow is the final day.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.968
(Day Six)

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.640
(Your Majesty, come to Zhongcui Mountain
alone at this midnight.)

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.720
(Murder demands a life.)

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.480
(Otherwise,
Consort Lu won't survive this.)

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720
With so many people around,
no one saw who shot.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.760
I'll send men to search
Zhongcui Mountain now.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.560
Halt!

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.160
Didn't you read the letter?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160
"Alone!"

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.960
Send so many men into the mountain

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.240
to get Lu Zhen'er killed?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.640
Your Majesty wants to go alone?

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.480
This is not advisable!

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.280
My decision is final. Prepare my horse.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.552
I'm here.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.240
Who is behind this charade?

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.000
(It really is Consort Xi.)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.960
(Impossible. It can't be her.)

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.000
Who are you really?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.360
Rest easy, Your Majesty.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.440
As long as Your Majesty complies,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.760
Consort Lu will be fine.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.360
You'd better keep your word.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.560
She is so nice.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.040
I would never harm her.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.360
Then why this elaborate scheme

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.040
to lure me here?

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.480
To kill you.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.000
To kill me?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.760
If I'm your target,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.400
why not strike in the palace?

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.240
Why disguise yourself

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.280
and lure me here?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.160
Fear your true identity may be found?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.280
Enough talk!

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.600
Today is the day you die!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.304
You and I have no quarrel.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.560
Your hands are soaked in blood.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.000
Can't remember how many you've killed?

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680
Whom did I kill?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.800
My parents!

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.600
So this is why you schemed

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.600
to stick with Zhen'er.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.560
Yindan.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.400
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.264
You have some conscience,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.120
not revealing your true identity to her.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.280
In her heart,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.320
you are still her dear sister.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.320
Don't talk nonsense!

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.960
I've never killed the innocent!

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.040
I heard those in black said
it was the late emperor's orders.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.320
Can't be any misunderstanding.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.480
The late emperor's doing has
nothing to do with me.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.440
I advise you

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.920
to avoid the wrong target.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.280
Get the facts straight
before you strike.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.120
Actually, you don't have to die.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.840
Had you not come,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.600
I could have taken Her Highness away

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.600
to live the life she desires.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.880
Don't worry.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.600
After we get out,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.440
I'll open a clinic.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.040
My job's diagnosis,
and yours is payment.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.800
We'll make a good living.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.280
And we absolutely won't go hungry.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.064
We'll open a clinic.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.824
Her job's diagnosis,

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400
and mine is payment.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.120
I wouldn't have to kill you,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.120
but you came.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.000
Don't worry.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.080
As you are sincere to Her Highness,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.640
I'll make your passing less painful.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.760
(I won't let you have your way!)

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.352
If you refuse to take this,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.320
Consort Lu won't survive.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.440
Take it or not?
