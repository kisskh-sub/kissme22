[Episode 33]

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.520
Here he comes.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.920
You scoundrels!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.700
Who gave you the nerve

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.640
to cause such a scene at my door?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.520
Mr. Nie,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.760
you're a big shot,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.940
not just in Wuxi,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.080
but across the entire country.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.960
We wouldn't dream of
causing trouble for you.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.460
Qian Dashun

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.100
hit us up for some cash,
and we each ended up

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960
lending him around two
or three hundred thousand.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.640
He told us you were the guarantor.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.640
Since we couldn't get a hold of you,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.579
we had no choice but to come here

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.700
and ask your parents.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.720
Qian Dashun borrowed money from you?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.780
What does his debt have to do with me?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.540
Why isn't Nianyuan back yet?

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.560
I wonder

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.120
how the search is going.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.300
You two really played me for a fool.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.880
Now look what happened.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780
I've borrowed nearly two million
from the villagers.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.360
If you don't help me pay them back,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.620
I can never go back after this.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.720
He told everyone
he was borrowing it for you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.860
and even said you guaranteed it
and signed for it.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.040
It's all right there on the IOU,

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.060
plain as day.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.620
A couple of days ago, he got drunk

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.500
and told us everything went south.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.400
Then the very next morning,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.480
he just vanished

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.620
and won't pick up his phone,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.460
so who else were we supposed

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.980
to turn to but you?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.760
Where's the IOU?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.380
I told you to bring the money

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.000
I gave you before.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.400
Who told you to borrow from others?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.500
What happened to the money I gave you?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.520
Did you blow every single cent?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.060
Were you gambling again?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.820
I...

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.880
Unbelievable.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.540
I kept my money with you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.580
because I didn't want Nie to find out.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.160
Some plan that was!

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.020
Now it's all gone!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.480
What am I going to do?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480
I don't have a penny

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.840
left to my name!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.680
Just ask Nie Chengyuan for more.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.980
[IOU]
Is it for real?

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.340
Nie Chengyuan is vouching.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.480
Would a big boss like him

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.400
be short a few million?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.579
Of course he wouldn't.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.600
He's just giving me a break,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.820
letting me make some quick money
on the side.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.540
I'll take the lion's share,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.360
and you guys can have the rest.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.760
You're not playing me, are you?

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.160
Why would I lie to you?

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.740
Nie Chengyuan is my son-in-law.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.760
There's no way I'm scamming you.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.120
Fangping and him
have been legally married for years now.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.480
If you're out,
then quit wasting my time.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.200
I'll just put in less
and take a smaller cut.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.900
Turn it off!

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.380
You have to keep the villagers

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.140
in check

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920
and don't let this spiral
out of control.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.900
We can't let Nie Chengyuan

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.940
hear a whisper of this.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.520
I'll find a way to get
the money from him bit by bit.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.520
Maybe

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.100
everything will be fine.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.820
Nianyuan is already at the factory

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.940
in Suzhou looking for her.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.760
We might get news

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.920
any minute now.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.900
Is that Nianyuan calling?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.120
It's Chengyuan. Don't make a sound.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.220
Chengyuan,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.180
why are you calling me
during work hours?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.880
Where is Qian Dashun?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.500
Is he at your place?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.720
No.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.200
I haven't been in touch with my dad

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.460
for quite a while.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920
Why the sudden interest?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.780
Are you sure?

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.840
Do you have any idea

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920
your dad has been borrowing money

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.159
all over the village

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.860
using my name?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.040
Is any of this true?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.720
I

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.680
didn't know.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.780
Tell me the truth!

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.200
I...

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.880
He borrowed...

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.800
a little bit.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.620
I only just found out myself.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.340
Nearly two million,
and you call that a little bit?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.060
What do you need all that money for?

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.680
Haven't I given you enough?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.300
Nianyuan.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.240
It was Nianyuan.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.780
She told me about an investment

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.740
that was a sure thing

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.400
and asked me for some capital.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.580
At first, it actually paid off,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.200
and we got the principal
and interest back.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.000
I had no idea that when we reinvested,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.880
those two would just take
the money and run.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.160
I...

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.460
Chengyuan.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.940
I was scammed too.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.760
So, Mr. Nie, what's your call?

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.240
Look,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.280
if you don't own up to this,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.880
we'll have to post it
all over the Internet.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.940
We can't just keep it bottled up
after getting ripped off.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.060
Gotta let it out somehow.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.440
Get the IOUs

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.480
and their transfer records

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.159
verified

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.380
and sorted.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.180
See?

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.860
I knew Mr. Nie was a smart man.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.900
Things would get very ugly

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.020
for everyone

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.040
if this blew up into a scandal.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.659
So,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.300
besides the principal,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.280
what about our interest?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.960
You want interest?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.220
You are fully aware

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.920
this has nothing to do with me.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.680
I don't have to give you a single cent.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.580
If you want interest,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.720
you won't get anything at all.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.380
You can take your chances
in court with Qian Dashun.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.980
But...

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.940
isn't he your dad-in-law?

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.780
Since when do I have a dad-in-law?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.900
Mine died a long time ago!

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.720
I'm settling this debt today,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.260
but there won't be a second time.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.900
And

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.840
if I hear

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.940
even a whisper

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.120
of this outside,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.560
I...

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.660
Fine.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.260
Alright.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.580
We'll take the loss.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.900
Forget the interest.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.600
Let's just leave it at that.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.000
I don't agree.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.360
You have to pay Li and the others

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.220
back,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.400
including interest

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.900
at the bank rate.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.700
You can settle up
with Qian Dashun later.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.880
But

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.100
the Wu brothers

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.159
and those two

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.880
won't get anything.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.040
They're always

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.840
thick as thieves with Qian Dashun.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.420
They probably set this whole trap

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.300
up together.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.180
I won't allow it.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.159
Mom,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.360
let me handle this.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.440
Just stay out of it.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.260
Handle it? My foot!

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.820
You pay them back today,

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.520
and in a few days,
someone else will claim

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.940
Qian Dashun owes them money.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.180
What then? You're going to pay them too?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.720
Is something wrong with your head?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.740
Unbelievable.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.520
I've thought it over,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.500
and the only way is to call the police.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.600
Let them investigate and find out

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.320
exactly how much

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.580
that old geezer owes.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.800
This is fraud.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.860
He should be locked up.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.660
Mom, let's take this inside.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.000
"Inside"? For what?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.320
Mom.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.560
There's nothing left to say.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.600
Are you afraid of losing face?

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.760
After the scene you caused today,

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.940
everyone in this village knows.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.060
Now you're worried about your "face"?

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.640
You didn't care much for your dignity

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.580
when you were fooling around

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.840
with Qian Fangping.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.180
Look at this.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.900
Guang's boyfriend is here

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.600
for the very first time,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.400
and you've dragged this filth

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.760
right to our doorstep.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.360
I can't even hold my head up anymore.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.040
You've dragged our family name
through the mud.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.520
I am beyond humiliated!

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.500
Guang, call the police.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.420
Don't.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.060
Go ahead!

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.100
Don't!

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.460
Do it!

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.740
- I said call them!
- Mom!

00:07:59.220 --> 00:07:59.580
Dad.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.380
[Radiation Area,
No Entry When Light Is On]

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:14.900
Guang,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.620
did I chew your dad out so hard

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.780
that he actually collapsed?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.300
Don't worry, Grandma.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.060
Don't overthink it.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.440
Dad probably just

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.100
got worked up and passed out.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:24.780
This isn't on you at all.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.520
If anything, it's Qian Dashun's fault.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.180
Exactly.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.640
It's all on that old geezer

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.720
and on Chengyuan himself.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.220
So don't let it get to you.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.900
But I cursed him,
saying something's wrong with his head.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.880
Could there be something actually wrong
up there now, Lin?

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.179
I wouldn't go that far.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.480
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.400
why don't you both have a seat?

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.440
It's going to be a while

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.080
before the CT results are out.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.080
Have a seat, Grandpa.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.740
Alright.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.540
Doctor,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.580
what's actually wrong

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.620
with my dad?

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.460
Are you the patient's daughter?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.400
Your dad's right internal auditory canal

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.200
is significantly enlarged.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.440
There's an isodense lesion

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.660
in the opening area.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.320
We strongly suspect an acoustic neuroma.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.980
A tumor?

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.800
An acoustic neuroma

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:22.760
is a benign tumor.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.300
It's usually not life-threatening.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.820
Excuse me,

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.680
but would it be okay if I took a look

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.260
at the raw CT scans

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.760
on your computer?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.960
The lesion is right here.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.340
It's not very clear

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.320
on the CT.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.280
We'll need an MRI to confirm.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.660
It's most likely an acoustic neuroma,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.260
measuring roughly two centimeters.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.160
That's on the larger side,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.000
but fortunately,
the compression isn't that severe.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.980
The adhesion
shouldn't be too bad either.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:53.740
Acoustic neuromas

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.920
tend to adhere to the auditory

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.620
and facial nerves.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.080
If the adhesion is serious,

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.400
it can lead to a range of facial

00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.680
and hearing symptoms.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.860
Are you a neurosurgeon?

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.660
How could you tell all that?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:07.920
I used to be.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.080
I've performed

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.400
a few acoustic neuroma surgeries myself.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.820
So what do we do now?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.560
We still need an MRI

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.300
for further confirmation.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.440
If it is confirmed,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.960
we'll have to get him in
for surgery to have it resected.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.280
Craniotomy?

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.000
Then we'll get the MRI
as soon as he wakes up.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.920
A tumor

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.940
out of nowhere?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.820
He's only fifty, for crying out loud.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.480
He's still in his prime.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.200
Back when he was with Jiang Yun,

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.460
things were great.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.380
But now?

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.040
He's let Qian Fangping brainwash him

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.420
into a total idiot.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.340
Not a single day of peace
since she showed up.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.520
Even if he was dead set on remarrying,

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.400
he should've at least found
someone decent,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.500
with actual character.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.240
How could he be so blind

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
to trust a con artist like Qian Dashun?

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.820
Now look where that's gotten him.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.500
A tumor.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.000
What on earth are we going to do?

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:19.800
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.100
don't stress yourselves out too much.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.220
The doctor and Yusen said

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.400
it's a benign tumor.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.840
Malignant ones are incredibly rare.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.340
He'll be fine
once it's surgically removed.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.100
I can't even imagine the toll

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.220
he'll have to endure
with going through brain surgery.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.400
Grandpa, Grandma,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.860
at least try to get
a little something down.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.140
I'm not eating.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.240
Grandpa,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.600
are you still feeling dizzy?

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.780
I'm fine.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.340
The scare snapped me right out of it.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:52.400
What I have is just minor stuff

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.720
but here he is so young

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.120
and facing a major crisis like this.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.900
It's all that drinking
and those late nights

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.280
catching up to him.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.820
You're awake.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.700
Dad.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:12.920
- Easy.
- Easy.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.520
Hurry,

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.340
lie back down.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:14.880
It's okay.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:16.680
Where am I?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.260
Miss.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.340
- You passed out.
- My dad is awake.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.220
You're in the hospital.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.060
I'll go get the doctor.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:26.420
Mom,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.960
what are you crying for?

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.140
What's wrong with me?

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.660
Don't hide it from me.
Give it to me straight.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.940
First of all,
don't start imagining the worst.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.660
The doctor said
it's not life-threatening.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.120
The CT scan shows

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.060
you might have

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.600
a benign growth

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.740
in your ear.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.500
But we still need an MRI

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.480
to be sure.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.060
What kind of growth?

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.400
A tumor?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.360
That's impossible.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.740
How could I have a tumor?

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.560
Doctor.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:24.920
How are you feeling?

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.780
Still dizzy?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:27.780
Much better,

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.180
but my right ear won't stop ringing.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.180
We need to get that MRI
scheduled as soon as possible.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.120
Is there still time to do it today?

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.900
Tomorrow is the earliest.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.060
It's too crowded here,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.220
and we have to wait in line.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.840
I'll go to another hospital.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.660
Public hospitals are always crowded,

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.000
but I'd still recommend

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.280
getting treated in one.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.640
I have

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.080
my own professional medical consultants.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.960
Where's my phone?

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.600
Just listen to Lin.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.360
He helped your dad with his dizziness

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.560
and it cleared up in no time.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.220
What does he know?

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.040
He's fine for minor aches and pains,

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.440
but how can he handle a tumor?

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.480
My consultants

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.320
are all seasoned professionals.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.460
Besides,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.760
even if we switch hospitals,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.520
when it comes to the surgeon
down the line,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.620
I'm going with the best,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.840
public or private.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.720
Grandma,

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.680
let him handle it.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.280
Told you.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.260
This company

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.340
[Andong Wealth Advisors]
was only on a short-term lease,

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:46.800
and they moved out just last month.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.380
Excuse me,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:14.800
[Deqiu Eatery]
where's Miss An?

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.820
Miss An.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.680
About this tall,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.960
wearing a red coat,

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.020
with big eyes.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.420
You met her last time.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.160
To be honest, I have no memory

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.300
of this Miss An you're talking about.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.460
She's

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.620
the factory owner's daughter.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.060
You were the one hosting us last time.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.240
You were super polite to her

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.420
and kept calling her Miss An.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.860
The owner's daughter?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.260
What owner?

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.340
Isn't this the restaurant

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.700
for the factory next door?

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.760
I heard it was mainly for their VIPs.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.840
It used to be,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.500
but it's been independent
for a long time now.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.680
By the time it got to our boss,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.780
it had already changed hands twice.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.920
But,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.240
the factory does send their VIPs

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.420
over here all the time.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.380
But isn't the factory owned

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.300
by someone named An?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.320
I checked it online.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.400
It's definitely An.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:50.840
True,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.040
but word is

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.900
she only has a son.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.740
No daughter.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.620
Li,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.760
you've got a good memory.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.120
Do you remember

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.980
hosting a customer

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.000
named An last month?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.500
The one who was with me.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:10.740
It rings a bell.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.720
Skinny,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.160
red coat?

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:15.740
Exactly.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.520
When she booked the table,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.260
she told us her name was Miss An,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.780
so of course that's what we called her.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.740
I remember

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.920
she showed up pretty early

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.940
and specifically told us

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.120
the guests were important,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.940
so we should pull out all the stops.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.780
She even took me for a stroll
around the factory.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.780
The security at that plant

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.060
is pretty lax.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.400
It's easy to find someone

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.740
to show you around.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:06.540
Fangping,

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.619
we're in the clear.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.900
Wu told me

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.800
Chengyuan covered all our debts,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.300
so I can come home tomorrow.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.579
I told you

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.300
we should've just talked to him sooner,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.660
but you just wouldn't listen.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.839
Give Wu a call

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:25.780
and find out the specifics.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.380
Hey,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.220
Wu,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.440
you absolute scumbag.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.680
What the heck were you doing

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.380
causing a scene at my son-in-law's?

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.860
You think I'd actually stiff you?

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.800
I just went away for a few days,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.880
and look at you, getting all worked up

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.300
and making
a complete spectacle of yourself.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.760
Drop the nonsense, alright?

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.400
Your son-in-law?

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.580
That big shot

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.720
doesn't even recognize you as family.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.540
Mr. Nie made it crystal clear

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.180
his dad-in-law passed away ages ago.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.060
Don't even dream of
getting a single cent

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.720
out of me from now on.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.100
And that "son-in-law" of yours

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.960
got so livid that he collapsed

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960
and was hauled off to the hospital.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.340
What?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.180
Nie Chengyuan is in the hospital?

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:04.940
Let me tell you,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.980
your free ride is officially over.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.280
Wait,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.200
Nie Chengyuan is in the hospital?

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.300
What exactly happened?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.800
He hung up.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.100
He said he passed out from pure rage.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.300
You should give him

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.000
a call.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.500
Did you find Qian and Mr. Zhao?

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.640
No.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.760
I've looked everywhere.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.360
The factory isn't even hers,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.660
and that investment firm
is a ghost town.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.600
It's all fake.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.000
The whole thing is a sham.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.680
They're just a bunch of con artists.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.100
A scam? For real?

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.680
What about Luo Ke?

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.020
Is he a fraud too?

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.140
Luo Ke?

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.740
He got taken for over a million himself.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.520
And he's just letting it slide?

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.020
Doesn't his family
have some serious pull?

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.640
Can't he pull some strings
to track them down?

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.420
I asked him.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.820
He said he doesn't care.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.280
To him, it's just pocket money
for a couple of months.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.180
As long as his dad doesn't find out,
he's fine.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.960
It's over.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.480
We're totally wiped out!

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.220
I put everything I had into that,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.300
and now it's all gone!

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.840
Good grief!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.060
You idiot!

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.900
You've completely ruined me!

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.420
I only put in two hundred thousand
at first,

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.520
and I pulled it out.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.260
You're the one who insisted
on investing more later.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.220
How can you even think of
pinning this on me?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.560
If you hadn't been out

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.220
running with that shady crowd,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.020
I never would've fallen

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.340
for such a massive scam!

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:54.860
Yuan,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.660
don't panic.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.940
Your step-dad covered all the money

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.160
we borrowed from the villagers.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.300
It's okay if we're broke for now.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.460
Once things settle down,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.280
we'll just ask him for more.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.540
Just play nice
and say some sweet things.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.560
Really?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.700
Mr. Nie really paid it all back?

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.660
He doesn't blame us?

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.220
Blame you for what?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.660
You guys were scammed too.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.880
A few million

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.380
is just pocket change to a guy like him.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.560
He has always had

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.860
a soft spot for Fangping since young.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:26.820
It's fine.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.660
Fangping,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.180
just butter him up a bit.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720
You know how men are.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:32.260
They're all the same, really.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.440
I'm afraid things are different
this time.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.540
His tone on the phone today

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.480
was off.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.120
What's so different about it?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.080
A few million

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.360
is nothing to him.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.680
Since he's sick,

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.500
go take good care of him

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.220
and everything will blow over.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.960
Just give him a call

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.060
to show you care.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.560
I should've never had you.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.600
Sorry,

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.840
the number you have dialed
is powered off.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.200
Please try again later.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.760
He's not picking up.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.920
I'll try again tomorrow.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.260
Based on the MRI results,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.600
we can basically confirm

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.420
it's an acoustic neuroma.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.020
It's 2.1 centimeters in diameter

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.540
and requires surgical removal.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.860
Why didn't you warn me
about this before?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.680
I recall you mentioning

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.280
symptoms of dizziness and tinnitus,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.240
but every time we scheduled a check-up,

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.260
you were too busy with work

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.000
and didn't show.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.380
Without an examination,

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.640
an acoustic neuroma
is indeed very difficult to diagnose.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.040
The dizziness went away
after I took some meds back then.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.320
So, what's the plan?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.720
Last I heard

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:58.980
from the doctors at People's Hospital,

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.340
they'd have to cut his head open.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.820
Surgery for an acoustic neuroma

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.820
usually involves opening the skull.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.420
The outcome

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.240
really depends on

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.440
how skilled the surgeon is.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.440
We tend to use

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.760
the preservation rates
of facial and hearing functions

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:10.740
as

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.940
the benchmarks for a successful surgery.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.140
A top-tier surgeon

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.300
can achieve

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.840
a facial nerve preservation rate

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.080
of over 80%

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:19.780
during long-term recovery.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.940
However, as for hearing preservation,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.560
the best data in the country

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.680
is only around 40%.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.800
What does that mean?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.320
Are you saying he might go deaf?

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.040
And what does facial preservation mean?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.700
The location of an acoustic neuroma

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.420
is quite tricky.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.340
It has adhered to

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.760
the auditory

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.020
and facial nerves.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.280
In an ideal scenario,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.100
surgery can prevent facial paralysis,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.440
but there is a high probability

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.760
of losing hearing

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.220
in one ear.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.000
Even in the best-case scenario,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:53.920
hearing will still be

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.100
significantly weakened.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.120
Removing an acoustic neuroma

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.540
is one
of the most challenging procedures

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.760
in neurosurgery.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.220
It really puts a surgeon's

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.940
technical skill to the test.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.100
How did he end up with this?

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.120
We don't even have

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.880
a family history of it.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.400
I told you

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.660
that the Qian family was bad luck,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.500
but you wouldn't believe me.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.900
Find me the best doctor.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.440
My hearing must be preserved.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.220
We've already put together

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.520
a list of the top surgeons,

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.580
along with their pros, cons,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.260
and success rates.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:23.380
The first few

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.620
are renowned experts in the country.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.880
Our top recommendation is Dr. Tan Zhi

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.160
from Tianhe Hospital.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.180
He's one of the nation's
leading authorities

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.700
on intracranial tumors.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.720
There's another doctor

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.740
who isn't on the list

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:39.500
because he's quite young,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.840
only around 30.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.740
However, he has an amazing track record

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.720
and he studied abroad

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.560
under a world-renowned expert

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.700
in acoustic neuromas.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.340
While he hasn't performed

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.280
a massive number of surgeries,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.520
his success rate is remarkably high.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.780
His preservation rates
for both hearing and facial function

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.420
are world-class.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.200
Which hospital is he at?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.300
Songshan Hospital.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.280
Surnamed Lin,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.620
he's the protégé

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.360
of the neurosurgery authority Li Shuzi.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.460
Should we

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.220
try to get in touch

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:07.060
with him?

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.420
Since he's young,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.500
we didn't list him

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.860
as a top recommendation just to be safe,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.320
but we could certainly

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.580
bring him in for a consultation.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.760
Then bring him in.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.700
Contact all the good doctors.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.040
There's no need.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.060
Just stick to the others.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.540
Dr. Lin

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.880
from Songshan Hospital

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.220
hasn't performed surgery in a long time.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:27.540
Dr. Liu,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.260
you really need

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.560
to update your information.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.500
That is

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.680
from two years ago.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:35.760
He was a sensation
in the industry back then,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.660
but

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:38.920
I haven't heard much

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.080
about him since.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.020
I was actually planning

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.560
to look into his status.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.260
Guang,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.420
how do you know that?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.480
Grandma,

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.140
the Dr. Lin he's talking about

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.920
is Lin Yusen.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.560
How can you be so sure?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.360
Lin is a common surname,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.760
and there are promising young doctors

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.420
everywhere.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.020
Besides,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.580
why are you just getting here now?

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.180
Dr. Liu is already finished.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:01.920
Dr. Liu

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.240
arrived earlier.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.560
Dr. Liu,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.100
is it him?

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.060
Indeed,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.280
it is Dr. Lin Yusen.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.540
Mr. Nie,

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.220
a doctor with that kind of talent

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:13.880
is extremely rare.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.500
Doctors like him
are few and far between.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.940
Calling him one in a million
wouldn't be an exaggeration.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.760
They definitely aren't "everywhere."

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.080
Why would he stop doing surgery?

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:24.800
Such a shame.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.020
He was in a car accident

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.080
and messed up his hand.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.940
[Taihu Lake High-end Medical Center]

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.560
Alright, here's the last of them.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.160
Mr. Nie, I'll be heading out then.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.200
There's one more thing.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.380
What is it?

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.260
Just spit it out.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.640
What's with the hesitation?

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.500
The South City Villa

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.720
has called me several times

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:01.920
asking about you.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.000
They said they can't reach you.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.620
How should I respond?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.540
You didn't tell her where I am, did you?

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.740
I wouldn't dare say a word

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:08.540
without your instructions.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.480
Ignore it.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:11.920
I don't want to see her.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:12.700
Also,

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.540
cut off

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.600
all her expenses
and fund requests immediately.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.040
Understood, Mr. Nie.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.340
Gong,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.460
how is Chengyuan doing?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.360
I'm really worried about him.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:24.820
Ms. Qian,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.680
I'm sorry,

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.840
but I'm not at liberty

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.200
to discuss Mr. Nie's situation.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.460
Please don't put me in a difficult spot.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.100
Chengyuan has
some misunderstandings about me.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.720
You've got to help me
get through to him.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.540
I really didn't know

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.080
my dad had borrowed that much money.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.600
Tell him

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.100
I just want to see him,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.000
just once.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.300
I'll leave

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.220
as soon as I find he's okay.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.700
Otherwise, I'll be on edge

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.020
and I won't be able to sleep a wink.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.080
I'm sorry, Ms. Qian.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.400
Mr. Nie said

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:54.400
he doesn't want to see you
for the time being.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.540
You can

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.640
stay in the house for now

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.140
since he didn't mention that,

00:26:58.940 --> 00:26:59.880
but he won't be covering

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.660
any further expenses.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.440
That's impossible.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.140
Chengyuan would never treat me
like this.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.160
What exactly happened to him?

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.640
Is he being controlled

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640
by those two old folks

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.300
from the Nie family?

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.240
We live in a society ruled by law.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.200
Nobody would dare do that.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.560
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.640
What's the deal?

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.800
Is that scumbag Nie Chengyuan

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.180
really turning his back on you?

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.220
I messed up.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.740
I was so panicked that day.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.980
I should have just said

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.200
I had no idea about your debts.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.300
If you didn't know,

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:33.580
there's no way he would've helped me
pay them back.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.800
Now look at us.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.240
He's even cut off our living expenses.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.940
He won't pick up my calls

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.780
or reply to my texts.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.300
I don't even know where he is.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.680
If I could just see him,

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.340
I could talk him around,

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:45.860
but if he won't even meet me,

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.160
what am I supposed to do?

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:50.780
Mom,

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.260
what if

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.320
I ask some of my friends

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.260
at the hospital?

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.180
Maybe they can find out

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.500
which hospital Mr. Nie is in.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.280
Friends?

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.960
Your friends are useless.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.140
Turn your ringtone off.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.120
It's getting on my nerves.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:06.820
Mom,

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.080
it's Luo Ke.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.780
Maybe he found the scammers.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.280
Put it on speaker.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:14.700
Hello,

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.620
Luo Ke.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.180
Did you find Qian

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:17.880
and Mr. Zhao?

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.040
Qian my foot.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.080
Where would I even find her?

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.000
My dad found out

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.880
and forced me to go to the police.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.480
My reputation is shot.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.080
Look,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.760
I'm calling to ask

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:28.920
if you want to report it together.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.480
A larger total
might carry more weight with the police.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.760
And besides, if I'm not the only one,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.520
I won't look like such a total chump.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.040
If we report it,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.700
can we get the money back?

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.840
There's a chance, I guess.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.300
I'm just worried
that by the time they catch them,

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.340
the money will be mostly spent.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:41.960
But we just get back

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.440
what we can.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.760
Let me think about it.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.360
If I report it,

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:50.540
I should probably do it in Wuxi.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.200
It's all the same.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:52.860
Whatever.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:53.800
I just wanted to let you know.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.220
Mom,

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.500
maybe

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.040
we should report it too.

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.120
If they catch them,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.340
we might actually get the money back.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:09.960
Exactly.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480
Let's report it.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.200
If all the money is recovered,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.260
wouldn't it all be

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.220
ours?

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.360
Nie Chengyuan cares so much
about his face.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.420
There's no way he'd ask you

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.680
for that money back.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.080
Report it?

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:23.780
Yes.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.560
Fangping,

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.560
stop stalling.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.160
If those two scammers

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.840
get caught

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.240
and we haven't reported it,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.520
but Yuan's friend

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.280
has,

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.080
what if they don't give us

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.580
our share of the money?

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.720
You're right.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.960
Nie Chengyuan can turn on

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.100
his own wife just like that.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.360
Who knows

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.220
how he'll treat me later?

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.220
Now he's completely gone dark.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.120
If

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.480
something happens to him,

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.880
I'll be left with nothing.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.500
Getting the money back
is the only thing that's real.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.400
Once it's back,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.180
it's ours.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.500
Nianyuan,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.900
report it.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.140
Do it now.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.560
I'm going by myself?

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:12.880
You good-for-nothing.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.680
I'm coming with you.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.220
Grandma?

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.020
Grandma.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.600
Guang,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.320
you're here.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.640
Why did you come down?

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.820
Just out for some fresh air.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.400
Your dad has been in a foul mood lately.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.140
He's been snapping

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.600
at every single person
who comes by from the company.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.760
I can't even stand to be around him.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.780
He's always been proud.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.640
With this disease,

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.980
if after the surgery...

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.640
He must be really anxious right now.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.800
I was worried sick before too,

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.640
but I've come to terms with it
these past couple of days.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.380
It's not life-threatening,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.880
so as long as he's still breathing,
that's plenty.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.340
We're all human.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.640
Everyone has their health issues.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:01.900
Besides,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.260
if he stays in such a bad mood,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.820
won't that just make things worse?

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.840
Right?

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.040
Thank you, Lin,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.400
for taking the trouble

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.280
to drive Guang back and forth
these past few days.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:13.720
It's no trouble at all, Grandma.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.680
Plus, there's a lot of work

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.420
at the company lately,

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:17.620
so I have to travel
between Suzhou and Nanjing anyway.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.640
It's all on the same route.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.880
Alright.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.360
Has a surgeon been picked
for Dad's operation?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.260
It's settled.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.940
Your dad insisted on waiting

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.040
for a foreign doctor

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.220
called "Will" something.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.020
William Schneider.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.060
That's the one.
You really know your stuff.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.640
So, how is that doctor?

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.460
Dr. Schneider

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.060
is a top neurosurgeon in Germany.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.360
I've looked over

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.840
all the test results Xiguang sent.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.820
Mr. Nie's hearing has weakened.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.220
If the tumor
is severely adhered to the auditory

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.640
and facial nerves,

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.040
the surgery will be extremely difficult.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.800
Professor Schneider

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.500
happens to be an expert in this field

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.000
and has published several papers

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.980
on strategies

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.960
for preserving nerve function.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.800
He's the perfect choice

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.960
for the lead surgeon.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:08.860
Let's head over

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.040
to the doctor's office first.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.360
This is Dr. Schneider's profile.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.140
Miss Nie,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.080
you can take a look.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.560
[William Schneider]

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:19.160
We don't have any issues

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.060
with the choice of doctor.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.200
It's just the timing.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:22.460
If the surgery is pushed back

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.940
by a week to ten days,

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.060
would that cause any problems?

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.320
I recall

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.500
from our last call

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.380
that you were leaning towards

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.300
finding a local doctor

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.220
and operating as soon as possible.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:31.520
Ideally,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:32.700
yes.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.040
However,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.980
for intracranial surgery,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:36.980
the patient needs

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.440
to remain calm and positive.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.920
Since

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.000
Mr. Nie is being so insistent,

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:41.960
I'd suggest

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.200
going along with what he wants.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.160
We'll monitor

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.140
his condition around the clock

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.360
to ensure

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.780
the surgery goes
as smoothly as possible.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:53.620
That makes sense.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.380
Thank you, Dr. Liu.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.540
I'm going to go check on Dad.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.420
Wait for me.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:04.560
Okay.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.720
Is Lin not coming?

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.820
Dad has a bit of prejudice
against Yusen,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.680
so he's sitting this one out

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.100
to avoid any awkwardness.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.300
How can he be so ungrateful?

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.120
Guang,

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.340
you should head out early later.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.440
There's not much to do here anyway.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.960
Don't keep Lin waiting.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:23.780
Grandma, it's fine.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.100
I'll just find a spot downstairs

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:27.060
to get some work done.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.480
I'm fine.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.220
It's just a minor surgery.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:32.900
Once I'm out,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.340
we will get together.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.640
No drinks for now, though.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.160
That's not it at all.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.280
Where did you hear those rumors?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:46.660
Fine,

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:48.800
I'm hanging up now.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.320
Dad,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.820
how are you feeling today?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.080
What is wrong with you?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.600
I told you not to call

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.360
the police.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.920
Why did you do it anyway?

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:03.980
Do you think

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.780
just because I'm stuck
in this hospital bed,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.020
I can't keep you in line anymore?

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:08.780
What are you talking about?

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.060
Still trying to keep me in the dark?

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.480
The news is all over Wuxi.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.300
I've been getting calls

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.100
all morning.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.199
On the surface,
they're "checking in" on me,

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.800
but really, they're just fishing
to find out

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.000
how much I got scammed for!

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.960
You're grown-up now,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.199
can't you be a bit more mature

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.239
and have some perspective?

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.020
A few million is nothing.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:22.960
Just let it go.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.380
How is that more important
than my corporate image?

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.719
In business,
your reputation is everything.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.179
You can't even get
your priorities straight.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.219
How could you let a measly few million

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.540
get to you like this?

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.800
You're my only daughter.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:33.540
All my money will be yours anyway.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.600
What's the rush?

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.480
What on earth are you saying?

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.380
When did Guang ever call the police?

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.940
So it wasn't you guys?

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.980
I see what's going on now.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.520
Someone reported a scam,

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.580
and because it's linked to you,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.420
everyone is calling you. Is that it?

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.800
Grandma and I weren't the ones scammed

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:56.739
and aren't even involved,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.720
so we couldn't have called the police.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.920
We only thought about it that day

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.180
because people were at our door
causing a scene.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.380
That's long over now.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.300
It's way too late to go to the police.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.200
If you

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.680
want to be the fall guy

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.440
and pay off someone else's debts,

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:06.480
that's on you.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.420
We have even less reason to report that.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.220
Qian Dashun borrowed money,

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:09.820
he couldn't pay back

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.520
and skipped.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:11.800
The people who got fleeced

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.980
was either him or his daughter.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.480
They're the ones who called the police.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.140
Wuxi is a small place,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.560
and plenty of people know

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.660
about you and Qian Fangping.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.080
If she went to the police

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.440
and got recognized,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.420
of course

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.440
it would blow up

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.540
and point back to you.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.880
Why didn't you

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.800
suspect them first

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:28.540
instead of coming at me?

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.960
Guang,

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.200
my sweet granddaughter,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.360
don't be upset.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.700
I will give him
a piece of my mind for you.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.880
You've completely lost your wits.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.540
No wonder people say

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.240
a new woman in your life
makes you forget your own child.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.740
You and Qian Fangping
aren't married yet,

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.580
and your heart

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.860
is already in the wrong place.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.480
I'm done taking care of you.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:54.960
I'm washing my hands of this.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.280
You've got money, right?

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.660
Go hire some more consultants

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.040
and caregivers.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.400
Let Qian Fangping and Qian Dashun

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.440
wait on you.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.840
Since you people are such "family,"
after all!

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.420
Guang, let's go.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.560
You think I called the police

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.160
because I wanted the money back

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.040
and didn't care about your reputation?

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:15.580
Haven't I considered

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.600
your reputation enough?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.660
Ma Nianyuan used my name

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.760
to lure Yusen to Wuxi.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.880
Yusen got into a car accident on the way

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.420
and can never hold a scalpel again.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.540
His career is ruined.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.380
Did I ever tell

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.500
my mom about this?

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.900
Did I tell Grandma?

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.120
I didn't tell a soul.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.380
And

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.280
after Yusen found out the truth,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.680
he never mentioned it to a single member

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.320
of his family.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:39.980
Have we not protected

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.760
your reputation enough?

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.120
This involves

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.080
Lin too?

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.280
Lin's accident

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.480
was Ma Nianyuan's fault?

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.720
And what did we get

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.440
in return?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.080
We got you targeting him even harder,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.500
even blocking his share transfer.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.080
Of course,

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.380
that's your right as a shareholder,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.280
which is why

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.120
I never approached you about it.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.820
But I truly don't understand.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.560
How can you

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.040
feel no guilt

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:09.940
about indirectly destroying

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.060
someone's career?

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.300
Instead, after learning the truth,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.100
you doubled down.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.020
Is it because you know

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.180
you're in the wrong

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:15.920
and you're just taking it
to the next level?

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.100
Are you acting like

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.540
you don't care

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.960
just to cover up your own guilt?

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.740
Nie Xiguang!

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.380
You keep saying

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.040
I'm your only daughter,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.340
but all these years

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.540
you've been busy looking after

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.840
your first love and her daughter.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:30.060
Where did that leave me?

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.620
When I was studying in Nanjing,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.420
how many times did you visit?

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.020
I work in Suzhou,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.600
and before you knew about Yusen,

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:40.560
did you ever come to see me?

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.840
Not once.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:43.680
Yusen thought

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.260
I was the one who lured him to Wuxi,

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.300
so he hated me for being heartless

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.020
and ignoring him after the accident.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.080
If I hadn't gone to Suzhou

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.940
and uncovered the truth,

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.060
I might have spent my whole life

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.240
taking the fall for Ma Nianyuan.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:58.920
If a man

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.880
as capable as Yusen

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.400
hated me,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:02.980
would he

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.800
retaliate?

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.320
Did you think about that?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.740
Has Ma Nianyuan done

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:09.660
other things

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.600
in my name?

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.540
Are there

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.220
more "debts" I'll have to pay for her?

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.360
Now that the truth is out,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.500
did you investigate?

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.740
Did you comfort me?

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.080
Did you punish her?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.100
Were you even worried that what she did

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.120
might hurt me?

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.160
No.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.480
You did nothing.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.520
Not a single thing.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.600
You took

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.580
Ma Nianyuan's word as gospel

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.840
regarding the accident,

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.980
and even two years later,

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.320
you're still slandering
Yusen's character.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:39.840
Today,

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.020
they were the ones
who called the police,

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.280
yet your first instinct

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.440
wasn't to doubt them

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.980
but to blame me.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.260
Dad,

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.080
do you actually love me

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.600
like you say you do?

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:00.840
Are you lying to me,

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.820
or just lying to yourself?

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.020
What a shame.

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.660
This is just a crying shame.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.940
What are you doing here?

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.200
I ran into your mom downstairs,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.260
so I walked up with her.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:53.540
Mom.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.380
I was nearby on business

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.380
and figured since you were visiting
your dad today,

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.540
I'd come pick you up.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.480
Since I was already here,

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:01.560
I thought

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.360
I didn't need to be so heartless.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.120
A visit

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.460
is only natural.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.140
I didn't expect to hear all this.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.560
I think I'd better

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.300
stick to being heartless.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.780
Xiguang,

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:26.760
you've been through so much.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.600
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.220
I...

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.620
I didn't

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:37.240
want you to be sad.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.880
Then, as time went on,

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.520
I just didn't want
to talk about it anymore.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:45.920
I

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.580
stopped being sad over your dad
a long time ago.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.000
Lin,

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.420
I am so sorry.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.180
Ms. Jiang,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.560
this has nothing
to do with you, Xiguang,

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.640
or her grandparents.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.400
Does your mom know

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.200
about this?

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:14.780
I think...

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.200
a regular car accident

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:18.900
is easier for her

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.020
to accept.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:25.760
Sorry to put you out.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.840
Mr. Nie,

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.900
you're in a hospital bed,

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.600
so I won't kick you while you're down.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.040
But sooner or later,

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.440
we are going

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.140
to settle this score.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:07.040
[Taihu Lake High-end Medical Center]

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.640
It's getting late.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.200
Let's all grab a bite.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.180
Xiguang's grandma, you should come too.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.320
Guang's grandpa is home alone,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.920
so I should probably head back.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.000
All right then.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.680
Grandma, how are you getting home?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040
A ride is already set up for me.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300
I'll walk you to the car then.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:46.860
Careful.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.200
I will.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.520
Lin,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.180
once all this mess blows over,

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.700
you and Guang must come over

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.680
to our place.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.180
I'll cook you something special.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:05.620
I'd love to.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:07.900
I'll definitely be visiting often.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.180
I'll be off then.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.560
Get home safe.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.500
Let's have a simple meal.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:35.900
You've been

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.280
running back and forth
and must be exhausted.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.580
Once we're finished,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.280
just stay the night at home

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.360
and don't head back to Suzhou.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.300
You too, Lin.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:44.560
Don't worry about the drive.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.840
