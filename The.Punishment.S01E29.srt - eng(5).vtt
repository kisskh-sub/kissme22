That's right. New houses for everyone.

and see what kind of paperwork we'd need.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.070

Don't crush his confidence.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.320

match perfectly, down to the details.

But the testimonies from He Biao's men

from Longwan Company,

are mostly vague.

a more in-depth investigation.

we can basically determine

that He Biao and He Gang

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.250
that he lives in his vehicle

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.530
and likes eating sunflower seeds,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.720
so everyone calls him "Guazi."

Based on the biological evidence
left at the scene,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.750
we can confirm

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.560
that he has no prior criminal record.

they had advance warning.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.170
That suggests

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.390
someone on the inside

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.630

the leak could have happened.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.560

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.000

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.810
What are you guys doing?

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.880
Let's make Captain Qin's favorite—

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.050
Coke Chicken Wings.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.110
Alright, I'll show off
my skills, wait and see.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:52.550
Go freestyle.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.310
There's vinegar, there's soy sauce—
don't worry about anything.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.920
Alright. Enough.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.270
Enough.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.000
Enough.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.830
The beef is delicious.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:03.960
Eat up, Captain Qin.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.410
Go ahead and eat.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.700
For Chinese people

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.960
food is heaven.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.750
When you're in a bad mood,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.880
just eat something good.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.810
Once you're full, nothing else matters.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.640
Xu.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:31.510
Hello.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.330
I'm Jiangyan's friend.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.000
You...

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.000
Are you

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.030
Ms. Zhang?

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.790
You know me.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.130
Congratulations. Happy wedding.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.790
I heard from Jiangyan

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.850
that you're going to work in Longwan.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.030
Yes.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.880
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.800
Get in the car.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.010
I'll give you a ride.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.160
Tianye,

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.790
your place

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.830
is really luxurious.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.800
It's alright.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.300
The liquor is good. Come have a taste.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.160
Is whiskey good for you?

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.750
Perfect.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.270
How's Longwan doing lately?

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.030
Is everything good there?

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:13.640
Pretty good.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.550
Jiangyan and I

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.010
are planning to
develop a new business line,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.830
focusing more on online orders.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.630
You're getting more ambitious.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.320
Thanks to you
for giving me this opportunity.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.880
No need to be so formal.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.830
Even if I'm not in Longwan,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.090
I can still lend a hand.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.310
Tell me,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.840
what do you need from me?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.880
Tianye,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.750
actually,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.880
I can help you too.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.610
How can you help me?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.020
Your business.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.010
You've got new ideas, huh?

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.000
Come on, tell me.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.570
For the port business,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.400
if we do more promotion online,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.680
it will definitely attract

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.740
a lot of investors.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.220
Now is the age of the internet,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.720
we have to seize the opportunity.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.450
For example,

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.640
we could get some influencers

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.070
to post about the company online

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.920
to boost our visibility.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.660
Once our company's reputation
is out there,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.920
we won't have to

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.750
actively look for partners anymore—

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.920
people will come to us

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.180
wanting to cooperate.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.510
What else?

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.680
Also, Tianye,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.110
I know

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.200
why you left Longwan.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.990
You did it for your family

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.690
and for Longwan's benefit.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.590
What do you know?

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.350
I...

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.430
I know about your

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.480
business behind the scenes.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.400
Well...

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.150
I'm also your family.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.310
I know you need people

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.270
you can trust.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.960
I can help you.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.270
I can help you make it bigger.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.960
Did you tell Jiangyan?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.440
No,

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.940
I know you don't want her to know,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.720
so

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.350
I definitely won't tell her.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.590
What exactly do you know?

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.110
I...

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.880
I...

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:58.790
Jiajun,

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.110
Jiangyan's parents passed away
when she was young,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.510
so our whole family raised her with love.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.030
You were her classmate;
we know your background.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.290
All we want

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.670
is for her to live

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.160
a steady, happy life.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.000
Don't worry about that, Tianye.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.160
I will always treat Jiangyan well
for my whole life.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.360
But you didn't understand what I meant.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400
What I mean is

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.550
that as long as

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.040
you treat Jiangyan well,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.170
that's enough.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.400
Don't get involved in things
that aren't your business.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:35.680
Alright.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:36.270
Tianye.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.240
I toast to you.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.770
Don't let me hear

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.400
anything bad about you.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.170
Remember that.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.110
Go home now.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.640
No matter how many hardships
we've experienced in the past,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.660
they are now behind us.

Growing up,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.720
I witnessed the development
of the port firsthand,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.250
and I have always hoped

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.270
that one day I could contribute,

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.130
even in a small way, to its growth.

they caused you.

you can give me.

Come on, help him
take his medicine quickly.

Medicine won't help anymore.

Hurry up and get ready.

I'll take you to the hospital.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.270
No need.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:14.440
Just get me some medicine.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.880
What medicine? You've got
such a high fever you're talking nonsense.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.860
You called out Hu Xiaoyue 13 times.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.650
I was dreaming.

You called for Wang Tao 24 times.

I was clapping right next to you
and calling your name,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.390
but you didn't even respond.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.480
You're not on their side either.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.980
Just get me some medicine. I've got work.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.720
Wait, are you seriously
trying to tough it out?

I'm fine.

It's nothing.

I'll go find some for you.

a bowl of porridge for you.

I'll go get you medicine.

Okay.

your complexion seems a bit pale.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.830
It's probably just
a bit of low blood sugar.

It's nothing.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.270
Please take care of yourself.

Wait, honey.

I've already signed the contract.

Then we'll pay whatever penalty
we owe for breaching it.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.400
I told you a long time ago

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.590
not to do this business.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.920
Why did you go behind my back
and negotiate anyway?

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.350
I don't see any problem with it.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.280
And I've been following up on this.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.060
Isn't it a waste to give up now?

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.640
They're only negotiating with you

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.500
to get connected with my brother.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.950
Can't you understand something so simple?

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.670
Longwan is Longwan.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.230
My brother is my brother.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.930
They can't be mixed together.

about this cooperation?

Didn't you say this was all up to you?

You need to give us a straight answer.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.240
Exactly, Mr. Xu.
You've already signed the contract.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.900

It's not nice to keep them waiting.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.000
You all go change your clothes first.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.530
Alright.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.730
[Hanzhou Emergency Center]

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.920
[Police]

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.190
This afternoon, a collapse occurred

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:00.320
at the Hangang Center construction site

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.960
in the Port Development Zone.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.590
Several construction workers are missing.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.550
After the accident,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:06.190
emergency medical services,
police, and firefighters

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.440
rushed to the scene.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.510
Rescue efforts are still ongoing.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.670
This afternoon, a collapse occurred

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.370
at the Hangang Center construction site
in the Port Development Zone.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:15.920
No one has come out
since the accident happened.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.550
[Liu Yi, person in charge of
Hangang Center construction]

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.670
Fang Lei,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.590
grab the USB from the drawer
and bring it to me—

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:27.230
quick.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.070
Who is it?

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.900
Ms. Zhang sent me to pick you up.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.920
[Fang Lei, Liu Yi's colleague]

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.000
The missing person is Liu Yi.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.710
He was in charge of the construction
at Hangang Center.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.800
When we went to look for him,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.930
he was already gone.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.910
The place had obviously been cleaned up,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.060
but we still found some bloodstains.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.360
Something feels off—

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.840
could be a criminal case,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.530
so I called you right away.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.160
We'll take it from here.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.070
Thank you for your work.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.000
You're welcome.

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.680
Jing,

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:12.580
I checked the security footage.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.690
There was a power outage in the neighborhood
when Liu Yi disappeared,

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.090
so nothing got recorded.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.530
But the guard told me that a guy

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.810
named Fang Lei

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.080
came looking for him.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.150
Fang Lei is the company's vice president.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.400
They interact frequently,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.200
so the security guard knows him.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.280
Let's report this first then.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:29.760
Okay.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.930
Right after the accident,

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.030

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.510

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.320

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.670
all rushed to the scene.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.210
At the same time,

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:41.150
the investigation

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.410
was already underway.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.550
About...

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:44.610
Where is Qin Limin?

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.160
Why isn't he here yet?

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.670
I've already called him.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.870
He's on his way.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.760
If he's not here in 5 minutes,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.190
he shouldn't bother coming at all.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.390
Call and hurry him up.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.070
Okay.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.920

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.590
Mayor Hong,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.090
I'm really sorry.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.500
The traffic

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:02.970
was terrible.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.920
Let me ask you,

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.140
how many people are missing,

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.480
how many are injured,

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:10.940
anyone dead?

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.270
The accident happened

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.360
so suddenly.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.040
As soon as I got the notice,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.230
I immediately activated the emergency plan

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.230
[Qin Limin,
Director of Hanzhou Port Development Zone]

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.550
and rushed to the scene myself
to take charge.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.280
But

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.590
the casualties

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.400
are still under investigation.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.600
What about the cause?

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.690
How did the safety inspection
pass before this?

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.740
No one expected the accident
to happen so suddenly.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.560
We're still

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.510
investigating.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.950
Where are the responsible parties?

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.810
Where is Liu Yi?

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.290
Are you going to say
that's still under investigation too?

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.880
Party Secretary Li,

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:46.550
Mayor Hong,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.110
it was too sudden.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.800
It really was too sudden.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.340
Hangang Center

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:52.780
[Hong Mushou,
Acting Mayor of Hanzhou City]

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.710
wasn't that built by Xinrui Group?

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.400
Where's their person in charge?

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.710
Why haven't they shown up?

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:58.760
We've already contacted them.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.190
Their chairman, Zhang Xin,

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.710
is on a business trip.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:01.230
She'll be back tomorrow.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.360
Is it a business trip

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.510
or avoiding responsibility?

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.960
What's going on with this Xinrui?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.290
Aren't they usually quite high-profile?

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.300
Now everyone's gone,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.840
casualties unknown,

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:14.960
the contractor is on a business trip,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.960
the person responsible is missing.

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.180
So what exactly are we doing here?

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.390
What does Hanzhou want from you?

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.690
Director Ye,

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.590
do you have any progress on your end?

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.360
Party Secretary Li,

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.880
the disappearance of Liu Yi
has now been officially filed.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.100
Our police

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.090
have deployed an elite team

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.020
to conduct

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.050
a citywide investigation.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.800
We've already got some leads.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.800
I'll give both of you

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.960
a detailed report after the meeting.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.440
Well then,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.050
Liu Yi's case

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.480
will be handled by Director Ye.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.230
Director Chen, you'll take charge of

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.470
-the rescue and aftermath.
-Understood.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.510
As for the accident investigation,

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.030
I think our city
should be directly involved.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.030
What do you think?

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.840
Hangang Center

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.810
is a key project for our city.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.840
The provincial government has sent people
multiple times to guide our work.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.510
They've repeatedly emphasized

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.400
that we must be careful and prudent.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.460
But what happened?

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.130
Problems still occurred.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.880
Isn't this embarrassing Hanzhou

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.680
in front of the entire province?

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.320
I agree with Mayor Hong.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.320
We'll set up a special investigation team.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.720
I'll personally lead it,

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:30.630
with Mayor Hong as deputy.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.910
The project stops immediately—
full-scale investigation.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.360
What about Xinrui?

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.670
Shouldn't that be looked into as well?

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:39.480
Of course.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.320
And it'll be investigated thoroughly.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.180
No exceptions.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.850
Have a seat.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.210
Mayor Hong,

00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.360
do you have issues

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.030
with our Public Security Bureau's work?

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.820
If you have any concerns,
please speak directly.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.550
Ye,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.120
this construction accident

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.960
has me completely overwhelmed.

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.190
You have to understand

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.590
I'm just an acting mayor.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.250
Just that word "acting"

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.450
makes things so difficult for me.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.540
We identify problems and solve them.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.360
Isn't this meeting today

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.440
precisely to solve these problems?

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.110
Ye,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.760
tell me honestly,

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.910
how's the investigation

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.500
into Liu Yi's case going?
