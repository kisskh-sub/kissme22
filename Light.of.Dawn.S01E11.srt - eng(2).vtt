(Muke Club)

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.439
I honestly don't know

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.719
when your mother gave birth to you.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.480
When I went to the attic
to get the truth,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.959
she was already dead.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.640
My guess is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.759
that she and Feifei's mom

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.520
were pregnant around the same time.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.759
They were tight back then.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.080
Inseparable. (Support Admin Watch on

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.599
Like they were joined at the hip.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.280
You get what I mean?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.080
Just like you,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.719
I was kept in the dark, too.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.100
(Early 1990s)

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.400
Golden Ball Angel, Qu Meng,

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.280
has recovered from an illness

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.840
and returns to the stage.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.360
Let's welcome her
with a round of applause!

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.639
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.000
Without her,

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:32.840
I wouldn't be who I am today.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.960
From now on,

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:37.977
we'll face a brand-new start together.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.360
Today, I'd like to invite her
to sing a song with me

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.088
and say goodbye to the past.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.200
Please welcome

I don't know how your mother
gave birth to you either.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.240
She was remarkable.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.120
If I were you,

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:10.759
I'd live well.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.399
After your mother passed away,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.519
Feifei's mom

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:44.279
tried to stand up for her.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.240
She caused trouble a few times.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.759
I was worried about her safety

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:53.080
and afraid she'd stir things up,

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.039
so I had no choice

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.840
but to lock her up.

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:01.519
She left a letter

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.159
and ran away.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.000
For all these years,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.600
I thought

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.639
she was dead.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.639
The whole time...

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.440
If you're

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.080
as innocent as you claim,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.480
you could tell all this to the police.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.679
I'm innocent,

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.399
but I don't deal with the police.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.840
I'm not used to talking to them.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.480
Besides,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.879
Xu Peng has been dead for years.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440
Does the truth

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.279
matter anymore?

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.879
It does.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.399
At least, it matters to your daughter.

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:57.919
You should tell Wu Feifei

00:10:58.755 --> 00:10:59.840
that all these years,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.150
she wasn't someone without a mother.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:03.200
No.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:06.879
Give me some time.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.440
I'll send Feifei away.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:11.879
Whatever you want,

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.639
just say it.

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:16.120
Come at me.

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:21.000
By the way,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.080
we're negotiating now.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.720
If it goes well,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.039
you hand the thing over to me.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.080
If it doesn't,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.320
you still hand it over.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.200
I haven't done this in a long time.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.320
Doing it again so suddenly,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.600
I'm a bit rusty.

00:12:29.679 --> 00:12:30.960
I thought

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.000
I'd never have to do this again.

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:46.480
Stop wasting everyone's time.

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.879
You're impulsive.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.879
You're young.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.600
You don't think things through.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.840
I'll give you one more chance.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.320
By 10:00 PM tomorrow,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.639
bring it to Chen Kang yourself.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:52.159
How do you plan to explain this
to your daughter?

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:55.399
Explain what?

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:58.559
You lied to her for so many years.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.320
Do you plan to keep lying
for the rest of her life?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.519
This is our family matter.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.799
Your family matter?

00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:13.840
Fine.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360
I gave you a chance.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.879
Help!

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:13.000
Help!

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.480
Who is it?

00:15:17.488 --> 00:15:18.440
- Don't touch me!
- Dong.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.550
- Don't touch me!
- It's me.

00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:20.270
You're safe now.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.080
Feng!

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.200
Why did you take so long?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.919
Feng.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.679
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.320
Feng.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.840
Feng...

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:41.120
Feng, it was terrifying.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:46.279
(I'm Gao Feng.)

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:48.399
(An orphan.)

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.519
(To me,)

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.960
(being an orphan
isn't just identity,)

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.519
(it's a mystery.)

00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.200

(The road ahead is full of thorns,)

00:16:08.755 --> 00:16:10.355

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.120
(and run on my bleeding legs.)

(as long as I run toward the end,)

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.840
(I'll see the beginning of my life.)

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.639

It's chilly.

00:17:12.555 --> 00:17:13.720
Don't catch a cold, Feifei.

00:17:20.222 --> 00:17:21.790
How many lies are you still telling?

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.039
Answer me!

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.599
You think I'm not hurting?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.599
You think I'm not hurting?

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.200
You think I don't feel pain?

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.279
You think I'm not hurting?

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.440
- Stop it!
- I...

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.640
Feifei,

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:24.119
come home.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:28.759

All you ever know

Any reactions lately?

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:32.799
I'm fine. Nothing wrong.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.680
Where's Qu Meng?

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.039
I'll help you find her.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:37.319
Hey. Wait.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.119
Alright.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.000
Did he suspect anything?

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.839
No.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:56.440
Wrap the bandage tighter.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.240
In another month or two,

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.488
you won't be able to hide it.

00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:04.440
I'll hide it for as long as I can.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:07.480
It probably likes hearing me sing.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.599
Every time I sing, it kicks.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.359
I really couldn't hold it in just now.

00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:16.320
They say a mother and her child
are connected.

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:17.920
I believe the baby

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.599
can feel how I feel.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.680
Come.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.799
Hold your breath.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.640
Forget it.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.839
Don't sing tonight.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.359
Thank you, Ms. Hong.

00:20:52.519 --> 00:20:53.359
It feels so nice!

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.720
Tell me honestly.

00:20:58.039 --> 00:20:59.119
Have you ever hated me?

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.720
Yes.

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:04.240
Of course I have.

00:21:07.711 --> 00:21:09.777
If you hadn't been waiting for me
at the gate

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.519
the day I got out,

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:15.759
my life might've turned out
very differently.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.319
But hating you doesn't help.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.400
Now that you understand me
and protect me,

00:21:22.119 --> 00:21:23.119
I'm grateful.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.599
There's no such thing as "what if".

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.960
Only karma

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:35.119
and the outcome we're heading toward.

00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:42.720
Don't get it, do you?

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:44.319
Yang Wenyuan told me that.

00:21:45.359 --> 00:21:46.480
Sounds deep, right?

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:54.799
♪I give long roads
to the distant horizon♪

00:21:55.519 --> 00:21:59.480
♪I give roses to love♪

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.039
♪What can I give you♪

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.119
♪My lover?♪

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.780
♪I give white clouds to the meadow♪

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.420
♪I give rivers to the ocean♪

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.380
♪What can I give you♪

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.100
♪My friend?♪

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.620
♪What can I give you?♪

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:54.279
The most dangerous place

00:22:55.599 --> 00:22:57.400
is the safest place, right?

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.240
There's no such thing
as absolute safety.

00:23:03.866 --> 00:23:05.160
This place makes the most sense

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.680
out of all the options I could think of.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:23.400
After Yang Wenyuan passed,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.160
did you come back?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.559
I didn't dare to.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.720
(Look, our club is new)

00:23:38.119 --> 00:23:39.240
to the real estate business.

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:41.920
We need someone

00:23:42.155 --> 00:23:43.622
to oversee things in Shenzhen.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.000
Emotionally speaking,

00:23:45.079 --> 00:23:47.119
Hongyue is pregnant now.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.200
As a husband and father-to-be,

00:23:50.222 --> 00:23:52.200
it doesn't feel right
not to stay with her.

00:23:52.359 --> 00:23:53.759
But practically speaking,

00:23:55.359 --> 00:23:57.759
a lot of people
are relying on this project

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:59.160
to make a living.

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:01.240
I wouldn't feel right not going either.

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:02.759
How about this, Wu?

00:24:02.777 --> 00:24:04.022
I'll make the call for you.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:05.279
You go to Shenzhen first.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.000
During this time,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.359
it doesn't matter
if you can't stay with me.

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:11.759
But for the group,

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.240
it's critical.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.559
Right, Mr. Xu?

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.000
So Wu,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.880
you head over first.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.000
When I'm close to my due date,
you come back.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400
Just six months.

00:24:21.555 --> 00:24:23.030
I'll be back by the end of the year.

00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:25.759
Once the baby's born,
I'll come back right away, okay?

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:26.960
Good, Mr. Wu.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.155
I must raise a toast to you.

00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:29.333
- Sure.
- Cheers.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.839
Then it's settled.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:31.759
A toast to Hongyue.

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:34.680
Alright, Mr. Xu.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.119
That settles

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.319
Wu's part.

00:24:38.319 --> 00:24:39.240
But I do have

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.519
something personal.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.359
Go ahead.

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:44.359
The doctor says

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.000
the baby's a bit big.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.160
It won't be very convenient

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:50.680
to stay at the club.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.960
I'm thinking of moving out.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:53.799
Yes.

00:24:54.519 --> 00:24:56.319
The club's too chaotic.

00:24:57.555 --> 00:24:58.790
It's better to move out.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.400
Alright.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:02.759
Whatever Mr. Wu decides.

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:04.000
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

00:25:04.279 --> 00:25:06.400
Also, I'll take Qu Meng with me.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.680
Why take Qu Meng?

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:13.039
If you're gone,
Qu Meng can fill in for you.

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:15.240
If she leaves too,
who's going to run things here?

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:16.880
Mr. Xu,

00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:18.799
the club can't run on

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:20.039
just Qu Meng and me forever.

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:20.720
Right?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.960
He Xiaohong can do a good job, too.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.119
You've seen that.

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:26.799
She needs more chances to train, right?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.880
No matter how busy work gets,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.359
I have to look after Ms. Hong.

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:33.160
Mr. Wu.

00:25:33.355 --> 00:25:34.590
I'll thank you in advance.

00:25:35.079 --> 00:25:35.960
I'll finish all.

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:47.279
Xu, Qu Meng

00:25:47.311 --> 00:25:48.350
is good at everything,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.200
but she has

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.720
a short fuse.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.960
Only Hongyue

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.119
can keep her in line.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.160
She can also take care of Hongyue.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.549
I think it works.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:00.688
Let's settle it that way.

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:01.799
Alright.

00:26:02.288 --> 00:26:04.310
Since it's your family matter,
you decide.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.480
I'm looking into Gao Dahua.

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:16.519
That cook.

00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:18.079
(He seems honest.)

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.119
(You can never really tell.)

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.160
(Don't be so naive.)

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:23.960
(Anyone working in a club)

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.400
(isn't truly honest.)

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.920
I checked into it.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.319
His family

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.359
has been wanting a child.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:40.920
Do you think I'm cruel?

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:42.519
No mother

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.720
is truly cruel.

00:26:46.422 --> 00:26:47.920
Do you believe in reincarnation?

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:49.960
I didn't before.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.599
But now...

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:56.319
I do.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.440
This life is already set.

00:27:01.444 --> 00:27:02.711
All I can do is to live well

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:07.000
and earn blessings for the next one.

00:27:51.177 --> 00:27:52.977
You haven't had the noodles I made

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.160
in a long time, have you?

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.720
Stop acting in front of me.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.559
You insisted on sending me to Shenzhen,

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.680
acting all reasonable and big-hearted.

00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:21.533
Who were you putting on a show for?

00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:25.590
But if I can keep acting long enough,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.200
doesn't it become real?

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:29.400
You fight out there in front,

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.960
and I stay behind

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.240
and support you.

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:38.400
Ming will go to Shenzhen with me.

00:28:39.519 --> 00:28:41.119
I'll find another driver.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.480
I think Zhang Biao is fine.

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:45.599
Let him drive for you

00:28:45.599 --> 00:28:46.559
and run errands.

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:49.029
He likes money,

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.733
but other than that,
he's not a bad person.

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:51.839
Sure.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.160
In your heart,

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:08.000
what are you to me?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.559
Be honest.

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:32.200
A woman.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.079
I'm your woman.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:39.759
I see you as my woman, too.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.400
The woman I love.

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:47.160
You're pregnant now,

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:52.720
and I can't stay by your side.

00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:56.960
I feel terrible, honestly.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.000
Maybe when I come back from Shenzhen,

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:04.559
I'll already be a father,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.920
and you'll be a mother.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.359
I wonder if things between us

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:20.599
will change after the baby is born.

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:22.359
I don't know.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.240
What do you think?

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:29.160
I don't know, either.

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:33.240
We'll see.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:06.980
♪I come to the street entrance♪

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:09.880
(There are two things)

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.200
(that never change,)

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:14.920
(no matter how much time passes.)

00:31:15.844 --> 00:31:17.488
(One is something you're born with.)

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.799
(Blood ties.)

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.519
(Who your parents are)

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:23.480
(can't be changed.)

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.920
(The other)

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.200
(is karma.)

00:31:29.377 --> 00:31:30.920
(One must bear the consequences)

(for what they have done,)

00:31:34.079 --> 00:31:35.160
(whether good or bad.)

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.340
Qu Meng...

00:31:36.466 --> 00:31:38.311
(There'll always be a day of reckoning.)

00:31:38.311 --> 00:31:39.266
Hongyue...

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.720
(That's justice and conscience.)

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.420
♪Reluctant to leave my neighbors♪

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.820
♪And my good friends♪

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.740
♪I cannot bear to watch

00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.359
Are you feeling better?

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.444
If you run into any trouble, come to us.

00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:04.510
Don't hurt yourself like this again.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.480
I don't know...

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.680
Madam, please take a look at this.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.200
Do you know her?

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.680
She's been using your identity

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.977
to move around Binchuan recently.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.519
I don't know!

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.880
I don't know her!

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.720
We won't hurt you.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.160
I don't know her! I really don't!

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.920
Madam, we won't hurt you.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.960
Please don't hurt yourself.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.240
Alright. I won't touch you.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:36.680
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.240
Take a deep breath.

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:54.160
Madam, I don't know
what you went through,

00:32:55.119 --> 00:32:56.680
but please trust us.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.759
We're here to protect you.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.039
But you have to tell us

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.240
what you know.

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:09.279
Only then can we protect you.

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:11.640
Can you tell me

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.440
what kind of place

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.799
the International Club is?

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:22.559
Young girl, do you want to go
to the International Club?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.319
That place is full of
big shots and celebrities.

00:33:31.119 --> 00:33:33.160
You have to sing and dance well.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.400
The lights stay on all night.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:40.039
(The music never stops.)

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.759
(There's drinking.)

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:47.240
If you're tired, you sleep.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.400
Don't go.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.599
Never go there...

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:31.679
Tonight,

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:34.266
he'll have to explain everything
about the International Club,

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:35.760
your mother,

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.400
and my mother.

00:34:38.066 --> 00:34:39.800
Lay everything out once and for all.

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:43.000
Where your family goes from here

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.039
depends on your choice.

00:34:47.555 --> 00:34:49.360
10:00 PM tonight.
I'll wait for your answer.

00:35:08.711 --> 00:35:10.200
I'll make dinner. It'll be ready soon.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.280
I was impulsive last night.

00:35:29.159 --> 00:35:31.400
Let's talk somewhere else.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.719
Young people shouldn't think too small.

00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:45.360
You can't give up on your future

00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:49.159
because of your parents' generation.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.599
By the way,

00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:57.000
our group

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.760
has businesses and projects
all over the world.

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:01.599
You like hiking, don't you?

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.000
The Alps.

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.719
Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.760
We have travel agencies for that.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.320
If you like the sea,

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.239
we also have projects

00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:14.000
in the Caribbean and Hawaii.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.119
Our company needs

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:17.440
young people like you.

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:20.000
Pick a place

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.800
and start over.

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:29.039
Mr. Wu, you're capable of anything.

00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:31.840
I don't think
I'll ever get a clean start

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.039
wherever I go.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.880
One bad morning for you,

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.719
one phone call,

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.360
and I'd be wiped out,

00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:39.519
just like my mother.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.360
What kind of talk is that?

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:43.760
I'm a businessman.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.920
I'm nobody.

00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:46.920
Standing here

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.760
talking to someone like you
is not easy for me.

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:54.079
Mr. Wu, you're astute.

00:36:55.155 --> 00:36:56.670
You've got a good grasp of things.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.480
Matters of your generation,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.199
money, and power...

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.440
You can deal with all that.

00:37:02.977 --> 00:37:04.510
But when it comes to our generation,

00:37:04.719 --> 00:37:05.400
to blood ties,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.360
and to feelings,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.639
you can't.

00:37:09.222 --> 00:37:10.670
Mr. Wu, think about this instead.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:13.360
What would your daughter do
for her mother?

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.400
Go talk to her.

00:37:15.719 --> 00:37:17.599
I've told her everything
I needed to say.

00:37:19.639 --> 00:37:20.239
Stop.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.239
I warned you.

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:26.880
Don't mess with my daughter.

00:37:31.044 --> 00:37:33.000
(After learning about
the International Club,)

00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.244
(I often come here.)

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.639
(I come here)

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:37.039
(to see where I came from.)

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.280
(I told you.)

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.840
I have ways and means

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.519
to deal with you.

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:46.840
Excuse me.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.599
We're Long Yu's parents.

00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:55.360
Who signed the consent form

00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:57.199
for Long Yu's surgery?

00:39:58.119 --> 00:39:59.039
I did.

00:39:59.559 --> 00:40:00.800
I'm Gao Feng's mother.

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:02.360
Please don't worry.

00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:04.519
She'll have all the treatments
she needs.

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:05.719
We cover the medical expenses.

00:40:05.719 --> 00:40:08.360
Why should you get to decide
for my daughter?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.039
We have money.

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:12.599
Long Yu shouldn't be
staying here at all.

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:13.559
Alright. Enough.

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:18.320
Gao Feng,

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.360
you're the one

00:40:20.519 --> 00:40:21.880
who put Long Yu through all this.

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:24.199
I don't care about your personal mess.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.000
But you can't drag my daughter into it.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.280
Let's be clear.

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:31.480
We're not here

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.519
to ask for compensation.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.360
But if anything happens to Long Yu,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.239
I won't let this slide.

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.159
From now on,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.710
you're not allowed to get near her.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.239
Once we're back,

00:40:43.288 --> 00:40:44.822
we'll transfer her to another hospital.

00:40:46.044 --> 00:40:47.755
I'm sorry, Mr. Long and Mrs. Long.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.800
What happened to Long Yu is on me.

00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:51.719
I'll take responsibility.

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:54.480
You don't even know who you are,

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.639
do you?

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.199
Take responsibility?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.480
Why don't you get your own life
in order first?

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:02.159
You spawn.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:07.440
Young man,

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:08.960
take my advice.

00:41:09.679 --> 00:41:10.840
Be realistic.

00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:13.480
Mind your own business.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.440
Mr. Wu told you that, right?

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.920
This tea

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.639
tastes exactly like the one

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.039
I had in Mr. Wu's office.

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.199
Knowing Long Yu,

00:41:33.488 --> 00:41:34.880
she wouldn't have told you about me

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.760
in such detail.

00:41:37.688 --> 00:41:39.844
Also, your daughter
just came out of surgery.

00:41:39.888 --> 00:41:41.400
She hasn't even woken up yet.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.480
You're telling me
to mind my own business

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.688
and rushing to take her away.

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:46.360
Is that how parents talk?

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:46.960
You!

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.000
You can call me a spawn.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.440
I don't care.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.920
I don't envy families

00:41:54.039 --> 00:41:55.149
like yours anyway.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.230
- What?
- Mr. Long and Mrs. Long,

00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:57.639
let me make my position clear.

00:41:58.159 --> 00:41:59.440
Long Yu is my family.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.039
I won't let you take her away.

00:42:02.066 --> 00:42:03.622
- What are you doing?
- Talk properly.

00:42:03.622 --> 00:42:04.280
Why hit him?

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.159
Old geezer,

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.840
I'll take that slap

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.880
for Long Yu.

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:12.039
But you don't deserve to hit me again.

00:42:15.159 --> 00:42:16.199
Look at this.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.920
This is a Guardianship Agreement.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.000
It's legally notarized.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.199
Long Yu and I

00:42:22.199 --> 00:42:23.800
are each other's legal guardians.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:26.400
I travel a lot,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.719
so I asked her to help me sign.

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:28.519
I didn't know

00:42:28.555 --> 00:42:30.400
she'd also transfer
her guardianship rights

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.440
to me.

00:42:31.719 --> 00:42:33.719
So compared to me,

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:36.920
you're the unrelated ones, understand?

00:42:36.933 --> 00:42:38.880
We're her biological parents.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.929
She left home as a teenager.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.888
All you ever did was send money.
You never took care of her.

00:42:41.911 --> 00:42:42.777
Parents, huh?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.280
Since Mr. Wu sent you,

00:42:47.519 --> 00:42:48.639
tell him this.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.639
No one

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.079
is taking Long Yu away but me.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.239
Let's eat, Dad.
