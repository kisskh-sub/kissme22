WEBVTT

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.120
Could it be

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.599
that I've been taken advantage of?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.199
Meili?

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.560
My credit?

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.439
What credit?

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.000
That bastard Liu Shengqing...

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.360
took my credit.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.240
The 11th floor is the Business Department.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400
The 12th floor is the Human Resources Department.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.479
This is the 13th floor, the President's Office.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.479
All the surveillance systems

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.800
are in the Security Department on the first floor.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960
President Qin arrives at the company at 9:30 AM every day.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.479
Therefore, you must

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.919
prepare her coffee in advance.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.560
She has an excellent memory,

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.719
but that doesn't mean your workload is reduced.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.240
So, you need to remember

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.919
even more than she does

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.199
to prove your existence is valuable.

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.879
Also, the language issue...

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.319
you'll have to figure that out yourself.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.400
This will be your workstation.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.319
Secretary Lin?

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.280
Is President Qin

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.000
particularly difficult to deal with?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.520
Of course

00:02:58.919 --> 00:02:59.680
not.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.759
Secretary Lin,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.840
when you say that,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.960
you have to have a conscience.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.120
How long has it been since you had a weekend off?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
Do you even remember?

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.280
Exactly!

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.319
Now, the time you have for yourself

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.039
is less than seven hours a day.

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.240
Let alone proper rest.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.120
I think what's flowing in your veins

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.280
isn't coffee,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.919
it's pure caffeine, Secretary Lin.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.120
Don't scare the newbie.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.919
Don't listen to their nonsense.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.960
Secretary Lin,

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.400
how long has it been since you joined

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.680
our team dinners?

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.439
You always have something come up last minute.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.479
Right!

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.680
So, come to the dinner tonight.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.639
It's to celebrate Secretary Xue's onboarding.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.599
Come on.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.439
Yeah.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.159
Join us.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.879
Come with us.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.479
A team dinner...

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.120
Who would've thought?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520
Getting overtime on the very first day.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.000
You started your internship

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.639
so quickly?

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.599
Not at the bubble tea shop anymore?

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:13.879
What can I say?

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.600
The offer was just too good.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.279
Let's all have a toast together.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.199
Cheers!

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.079
So, you never invited me to your gatherings before?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.399
That's because we didn't know

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.920
you also like barbecue, President Qin, right?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.000
Yes, yes, yes!

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.439
And also, President Qin, look,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.959
the environment here is so poor.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.279
We were afraid you'd be uncomfortable.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.920
Ah, right, right!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.040
And also because

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.720
we were afraid you'd be bored.

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:52.680
Because what we talk about here

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.879
is, after all, just

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.120
the daily lives of 9-to-5ers.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.040
Too mundane,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.000
too ordinary.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.519
Secretary Lin joins often too.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.000
Only occasionally.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.560
It's only when you don't summon me,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.000
which is rare.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.439
This is bullying.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.879
Pure workplace bullying.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.120
You mean

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.120
we, the employees, are bullying you, the boss?

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:28.319
Employees bullying the boss...

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.839
What a niche concept.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.879
Boss,

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.360
if you don't want to be bullied even worse,

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.879
you should keep your presence to a minimum.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:40.480
Well then, how about

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.000
to welcome President Qin's arrival,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.240
we raise our glasses for a toast?

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.560
Come on, come on!

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.600
Welcome, President Qin!

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.879
Cheers, cheers!

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:58.040
Let's play a game.

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:59.720
What do you say?

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.160
Right.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.839
Let's play this Compliment Game.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.439
Okay, okay!

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.120
What's the Compliment Game?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.759
It's simple.

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.040
We just compliment each other.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.319
Like on looks or personality,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.240
and of course, ability and all that.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.439
As long as each person

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.000
gives one compliment to everyone else,

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:25.519
mutual appreciation,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.560
then it's done.

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:30.240
This game is no good.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.040
Why?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.879
Because I have far too many good points.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.560
If you had to praise me,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.480
you'd be talking till dawn.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.600
Boss,

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.639
not everyone will only compliment you.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.240
They'll also choose who to compliment.

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.199
But with me sitting here,

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.560
who would compliment anyone else?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.560
True, true.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.279
How about we play the Criticism Game instead?

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.680
Criticism?

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.199
Boss,

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.279
this game isn't good for team unity.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.120
No boss

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.680
wants their employees

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.839
to be sworn brothers.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.519
Fine.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.079
The Criticism Game is good too.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.839
Let's do the Criticism Game.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:11.319
So, we...

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.639
I'll go first.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:14.439
Xixi,

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.800
actually, you, you...

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.920
Your flaw

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.240
is quite obvious.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.360
You're just too nice.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.040
Every time we tell you something,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.120
you just say "okay, okay."

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.040
We never know if you really mean it's good

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.240
or if you're just saying it.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.959
Every time I say "okay" to you all,

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.600
I really, truly mean it's very good.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.839
And you know what?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.160
Whenever I try to say "no,"

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.879
whenever I try to say "not good,"

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.120
I bite my tongue.

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:46.560
Are you for real?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.959
Really, look.

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.079
I want to criticize

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.000
President Qin.

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:57.360
Your flaw is you don't care if people live or die.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.639
You're always monopolizing our Secretary Lin.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.720
What she means is,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.800
you're so beautiful it's lethal.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.600
Yes, yes, yes.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.680
Exactly right.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.720
Everyone's had their turn.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.399
Then it's my turn.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.240
I want to criticize Secretary Lin.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.959
Because he, towards me...

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:18.920
Sex...

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.680
ual...

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.639
harassment.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.000
What?

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.160
No, I mean...

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.600
An employee sexually harassing the boss.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.200
What a rare case.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.440
Bye-bye.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.679
Bye, Secretary Lin.

00:08:44.679 --> 00:08:45.600
No need to see us out.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.039
Take care, take care.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:53.799
Boss?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.080
You haven't left yet.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:56.840
Secretary Lin,

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.639
what you just said...

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:02.000
was it all true?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.879
Yes.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.399
Contacting the Care Agency for an emergency night visit,

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.879
hiring a professional caregiver to come to your home,

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.679
the cost to change your clothes was very high.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120
There are payment vouchers

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:12.159
and your home security cameras as proof.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.799
I clearly remember you said

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.039
not to change your undergarments for you.

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.120
But I was genuinely worried

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.240
about your personal hygiene.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.519
Then why didn't you say so just now?

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.919
Not reporting the situation to you

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.799
at the first opportunity,

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.159
leading to your misunderstanding,

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.720
is itself a failure in my duties.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.559
I shouldn't have such a lapse in my work

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.200
in my final month.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.399
Secretary Lin,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.879
date me.

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:47.720
But I...

00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:50.120
don't like you, Boss.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.639
Why do you say you don't like me?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.080
Boss, you are truly outstanding.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.360
Kind, with a strong sense of justice,

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.159
not snobbish,

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.159
and exceptionally capable.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.799
These are all excellent qualities.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.480
Apart from being arrogant,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.240
conceited,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.080
lacking empathy,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.320
having terrible drinking manners and tolerance,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.679
and being unable to take care of yourself after drinking,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.960
you have almost no flaws.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:17.360
Secretary Lin,

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.840
in the future, you can omit the second half.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.879
What about being pretty?

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.159
Being pretty

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000
is your least noteworthy quality.

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:30.240
You proposing we date

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.960
might just be a momentary whim.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.960
It doesn't mean you truly like me.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.159
Why do you think that?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.639
Because I've never seen you

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.799
do anything for me

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:41.720
that would express you liking me.

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.720
That's a mouthful.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.120
So, you really

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.639
don't like me?

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:50.960
I don't.
