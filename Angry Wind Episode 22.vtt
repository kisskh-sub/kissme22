00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.000
Mr. Zheng

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.760
You cannot leave Haicheng during the investigation.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.720
We ask for your cooperation.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.040
The manufacturer sent someone over.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.400
They want to see you.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Where are they?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.120
At the hotel.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.920
Let's go. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.280
Hello, Mr. Zheng.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.400
I'm the PR manager for Xixi Dairy.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.040
My surname is Zhang.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.000
And this gentleman...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.920
is our Quality Control Supervisor, Manager Li.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.720
The two of you finally made it.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.480
Mr. Zheng.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.920
Based on our investigation,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.200
the problematic formula on the market

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.600
is indeed counterfeit.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
You already have results, is that right?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.160
Manager Li,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.720
please brief us on the situation.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120
This is a can of the bad formula

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800
I obtained from a mother.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.800
It's a fake.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.360
It could indeed pass for the real thing.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.760
But upon close inspection,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.560
the anti-counterfeit code lacks a layer of detail.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.920
Specifically, there's no identification code inside the can.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.520
This is a packaging can from our factory.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.520
Take a look.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.000
As for the formula itself,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.320
we also conducted tests.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.320
Here is the test report.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.120
So we can say with certainty

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.800
that the problematic formula sold on the market

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600
absolutely did not come from our factory.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.720
It's undoubtedly fake goods.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.600
So that means our formula

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600
has no issues whatsoever?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.200
Indeed, there are unscrupulous merchants

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.520
counterfeiting and selling shoddy imitations of our product.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.040
Based on the existing evidence,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.560
the formula has no connection to the manufacturer.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.120
Furthermore,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.120
our formula undergoes strict verification before leaving the factory.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.240
The issue now is

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.200
the formula entered your port

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.240
and problems arose.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.040
No.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.120
Our legal team will also get involved.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.840
We need to handle this problem properly.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.600
Otherwise,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.640
Mr. Zheng could face a ten-year prison sentence.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.560
Are you trying to wash your hands of this?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.640
And with threats and intimidation on top of it?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.440
Manager Zhou,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.440
we are also here to resolve the issue.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.720
Is this how you solve problems?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.680
Get out!

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.800
Get out, now!

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.840
Mr. Zheng,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.520
we'll take our leave now.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.000
Alright, alright.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.000
Enough.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.040
It's not that serious.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.840
It's really not that serious.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.760
Didn't you hear him?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.720
He said ten years in prison.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.840
Just because he says ten years, doesn't mean it's ten years.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.200
Why believe him so readily?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.000
We will definitely solve this formula problem.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.520
I told you not to partner with Cheng Yadong back then.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.120
You insisted on giving him this chance.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.240
And now look.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.240
Feng-ge.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.840
I think there's something fishy about this.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.600
The manufacturer has no issue.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.400
Our transportation has no issue.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320
Then the only problem is the port in the middle.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.520
Right.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.000
You two, come with me to the port.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.920
What?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.520
The company has been sealed off.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.720
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.640
Absolutely no mistake.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.520
And it was the Commerce Bureau that put up the seals.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.320
Excellent.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.120
Perfect.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.200
Seems our move was correct.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.600
And I also heard

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.960
Zheng Nanfeng might get ten years.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.360
Only ten years?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.640
That's letting him off too easy, isn't it?

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.840
Do as I instructed.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.920
We absolutely cannot let this Zheng Nanfeng

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.200
have any chance to turn things around.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.320
Understood.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.080
The company's been sealed off.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.040
That's right.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.960
I probably can't stay at that port either.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.120
I need to make my exit quickly.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.520
So he's finally got his comeuppance.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.680
Boss.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.840
Zheng Nanfeng is here.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.120
Where is he?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.640
He's at the dock.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.320
Let's go.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.400
Found anything?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.120
We searched all around.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.920
Nothing for now.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.680
Well, well.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.120
Mr. Zheng is here.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.120
What are you looking for?

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.200
Sneaking around like that.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.760
Tell me,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.480
did you tamper with that batch of formula?

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.800
Don't make wild accusations.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.320
Cheng,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.640
I've long thought you were up to something.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.560
From leaving the factory to being put on shelves,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.640
the port is the only link in the chain with a problem.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640
And you still say it wasn't you?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.040
You two were involved when the shipment arrived, right?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.640
I never laid a finger on this shipment, okay?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.560
Now that there's trouble,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.440
you're making me the scapegoat.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.360
It won't be that easy.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.400
No matter.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.760
I will get to the bottom of this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.120
Aming, Aqiang.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.960
Search every one of them.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.840
Yes, sir.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.520
If I find out you're involved in this,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.320
you won't get off easy.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.800
Mr. Zheng,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.240
did you never intend to cooperate with me?

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720
Now that there's a problem,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.320
you're pushing me out to take the fall?

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.240
Fine.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.320
Go ahead and search.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.120
Search all you want.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.640
Let's see what you find.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.040
Zhiyi

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.760
What are you doing here?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.240
Do you know what situation Zheng Nanfeng is in?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.360
So what if I know?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.520
So what if I don't?

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.520
His company is sealed.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.560
All of Haicheng is full of negative news about him.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.840
He's in deep trouble.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.120
I know.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.800
You know, yet you're still with him?

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.960
You should make plans early.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.800
What plans should I make?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.240
I'm his wife.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.120
Even if he dies, I won't leave him.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.520
Zhiyi.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.720
Don't you know?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.520
Zheng Nanfeng will be arrested soon.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.720
Given his charges,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720
it's at least ten years.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.200
Can you wait ten years?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.440
He was framed.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.520
This matter will definitely be cleared up.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.640
And even if he's wrongly sentenced to ten years,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.200
I'm willing to wait for him.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320
You'd wait for him to get out?

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.360
You're crazy.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.080
Zhiyi, listen to me.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.720
I've saved a lot of money over the years.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.400
Enough for us to live abroad.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.520
Leave him.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.080
Come with me.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.200
Let's start over, okay?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440
Cheng Yadong, we can't start over.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.000
Zheng Nanfeng is the man I've chosen for this life.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.800
Zhiyi, listen to me.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.160
Zhiyi!

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.200
Cheng Yadong, let go of me!

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.120
Zhiyi, listen to me!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120
Cheng Yadong!

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.720
Stop!

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.920
Ah Ming, Ah Qiang.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.800
Why did you stop me back then?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.160
Why didn't you let me act?

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.640
If I had made a move,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.920
I would've crippled him for sure.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.600
Look at how he was today.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.960
This matter probably has nothing to do with him either.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.240
You two go investigate.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.320
See if there are any other leads.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.440
Alright.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.960
Let's go.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.720
Go on, go.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.320
What are you thinking about?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.720
Do you remember what our first meeting was like?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.760
The first time?

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.320
Mm-hmm.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.120
You seemed to be interviewing at the dance hall.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.560
You were wearing...

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560
Bell-bottoms.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560
Pointy shoes.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.360
Bell-bottoms and pointy shoes?

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.400
That's so exaggerated.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.520
It's the truth.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.000
Our first meeting,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.320
was at Xie Jiachang's dance hall.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.560
I was tied up by him.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.840
You rushed in to save me.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.520
Yeah.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.920
You said...

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.560
From that moment on,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.120
it's like you lost your memory.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.400
You don't remember anything before that.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.760
I remember.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.720
But what I remember from before

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.320
is probably different from what you remember.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.800
More like another world.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.320
Alright, this is getting more and more far-fetched.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.320
Ever since you came back then,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.120
it's like you became a different person.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.120
You actually dared to hug me and call me 'wife'.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.200
I really thought Xie Jiachang had beaten you silly.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.720
In that world,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.000
I didn't come home often.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.040
I didn't understand you either.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.600
We had a lot of conflicts.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.640
It sounds like a dream.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.360
If you say it's real,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.560
it's too fantastical.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.240
If you say it's fake,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.560
the details are described so realistically.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.520
Just treat it as listening to a story.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.520
As long as we're together from now on,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.040
I will definitely cherish you.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.520
I love you.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.520
I love you too.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.240
Brother Feng.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.400
Based on the leads we got,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.600
we followed the trail all the way.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.520
We really found the source of the poisoned milk powder.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.360
It's this small, run-down house.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.320
But,

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.120
when we got here, the place was already empty.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.200
The counterfeiters all ran away.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.520
We have no other leads.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.520
The trail ends here.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.840
Alright.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.240
Let's head back.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.480
Brother Feng.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.600
You guys go back first.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.640
I just remembered there's something else I need to do.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.520
Need any help?

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.080
No.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.600
You go back first.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.960
Really, no need.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.920
Really, no need.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.920
Okay.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.600
Call us if you need anything.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.720
Alright.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.720
What's wrong?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.200
You seem a bit distracted today.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.120
It's nothing, really.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.240
We can't be careless with dock matters.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.920
If anything's wrong, remember to tell me.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.120
Understood.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.520
I say, Manager Xie.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.720
What are you doing here again?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120
I've told you before.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.120
Cooperation between us is impossible.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.400
I'm afraid the moment I leave,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.760
Manager Cheng will beg me to come back.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.440
I hear Manager Cheng has a private warehouse.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
Which number warehouse was it?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.440
Warehouse number four.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.240
Oh, right.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.520
Manager Cheng of Warehouse Four,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.040
It's said, you know,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.600
some extra goods appear in there.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.520
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.960
And there will be 258 containers,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.320
that become 248 containers.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.440
How do you know this?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.000
Have you forgotten Brother Hong from Dida?

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.800
If Zheng Nanfeng finds out about this,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.720
what do you think he'll do?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.000
Threatening me?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.760
Not at all.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.320
I just want to cooperate with you, Manager Cheng.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.960
Fine.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.840
How do we cooperate?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.640
Didn't I make it very clear last time?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.360
And I will fully support you

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.480
in winning your wife back.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.640
Kill Zheng Nanfeng.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.400
I miss you.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.320
Whenever dusk arrives,

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.200
and the evening breeze rises,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.040
I miss you.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.040
Life's mysteries,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.160
try not to see them clearly.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.560
Close your eyes,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.760
don't respond.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.760
The evening breeze blows and blows,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.440
go with the wind.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.880
Tonight, child, don't cry in secret.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.040
Don't cry in secret.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.880
The evening breeze blows and blows,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.560
go with the wind.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.720
With the night's curtain and stars,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.720
gently fall asleep.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.160
Blow, evening breeze.
