WEBVTT

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.400
Boss

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.880
inside

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Xie

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.120
Didn't expect it; I didn't come looking for you

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.280
yet you came knocking yourself

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.960
Boss Cheng wouldn't, about the past,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.960
still hold a grudge, right?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.520
If it weren't for you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.720
I wouldn't have stayed abroad that long

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.840
A Shan (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.400
Cut off his hand for me

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.080
Don't move

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.760
Wait

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.120
Don't you want to hear why I came today?

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.000
Back then, in Haicheng,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.680
you were quite a big name

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.240
you got the wind when you asked,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.280
and the rain when you asked

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.080
Now you're content just guarding a warehouse here?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.760
Your woman was snatched

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.120
You're willing to let it slide like that?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.080
What Zheng Nanfeng is holding in his arms now

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.280
is your wife

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.480
the seat he's sitting on

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.960
was supposed to be yours

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.200
Now he's taken everything

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
Are you willing to accept that?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.880
What on earth are you trying to say?

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.520
Don't be snide with me

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200
We're on the same boat now

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.000
We have a common goal

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.160
It's Zheng Nanfeng

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.480
Boss Xie, do you know

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.400
I'm currently working with Zheng Nanfeng

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.240
That's bullshit cooperation

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.720
Just an errand-boy gig

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.680
Say that again

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.400
Easy, Boss Cheng

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.000
I said we're on the same boat

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.920
I can take back everything you lost

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
all of it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.040
You alone?

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.480
Don't get yourself tossed back inside

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.000
On my own is not enough

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.440
But I wonder

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.160
Is Master Hong enough?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.080
You know Master Hong?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.920
Oh

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800
I was inside with him

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.680
But now his network is in my hands

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.880
If you join forces with me

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.600
taking on Zheng Nanfeng won't be a problem

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.320
So what's your plan now?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.400
No

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.720
Absolutely not

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.080
What?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600
Scared?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.560
I, Cheng Yadong,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.760
have hustled for years,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.880
what have I ever feared?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.200
No reason to refuse me

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.360
I have my own way of doing things

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.280
I know Boss Cheng is someone

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.440
who won't settle for second place

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.720
I hope you'll think it over

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.720
I don't need to think it over

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.520
Thanks

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.160
Please

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.000
So absolute, huh?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.640
I'm afraid I might change my mind

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.280
Boss Xie won't even get out this door

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.680
Fine

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.440
We'll meet again

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.800
Boss

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.600
It seems this Cheng Yadong

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.120
really doesn't want to work with us

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.040
At some moment

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.760
he was already tempted

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.440
It's just that people like him

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640
are a bit hesitant

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.280
Looks like we need to add fuel to the fire

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.640
and heat him up from behind

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.360
I don't think he's that capable

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.800
to deal with Zheng Nanfeng

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.320
We can do it without him just the same

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.000
Zheng Nanfeng is on the rise now

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.400
with Deep Harbor Group backing him

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160
To take down someone like that

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.200
we must win over

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.400
people we can use

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.080
Then this fire

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.840
how do we plan to burn it?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.560
Doesn't he make milk powder?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.640
We'll work that angle

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.720
Got it

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.200
For anyone who won't get on board

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.360
we'll tie him onto the boat

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
Nanfeng

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.800
This is the order Youyou transferred from the mall

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.360
What?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.200
It's infant formula again

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.560
A well-known overseas brand

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.040
I heard it's a nationally distributed product

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.840
The distribution volume is high

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.040
So demand is high

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.080
The merchant wants our logistics channel to speed shipping

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.240
No problem

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.480
I'll have A Ming and A Qiang handle it personally

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.280
Okay

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.080
Remember to drink water

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.200
Why did you two come in person?

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.240
Brother Nanfeng told us to

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.960
Get to work

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.440
Fine

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.800
Do a good job

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.040
Stay sharp in a bit

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.160
Stick to the plan

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.960
Okay

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.440
Go ahead

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.840
What's wrong?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.320
You seem a bit distracted today

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.200
It's nothing, it's nothing

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.360
We can't be careless about things at the dock

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.680
If anything comes up, remember to tell me

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.480
Understood

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
Is the handover done?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.640
It's all taken care of

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.360
Then get back to work

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.680
I'll talk with A Qiang alone for a bit

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.560
Okay

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.480
Still mad at me?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.120
It's all in the past

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.440
Let's go

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.760
It's all in the past

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.560
Don't be mad

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.040
I'll arrange drinks tonight

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.480
A Qiang

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.320
Put it away properly

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.000
Bring that over here

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.120
All loaded up, right?

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.560
Loaded up

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.120
Get in the truck

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.880
Brother Nanfeng

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.640
Something's wrong

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.720
We have a big problem

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.400
Some babies who drank our formula

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.240
are all poisoned

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.520
They're in emergency treatment at the hospital now

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.360
It's infant formula—how could it go wrong?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.640
Isn't it a genuine big-brand product?

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.720
Could there be some misunderstanding?

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.880
Or some slip-up occurred

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.680
I went to verify the batch number of the goods

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.160
I even checked the can code

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.560
It was indeed the batch we transported

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.240
Are you sure you

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.440
checked the can code for that batch

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.240
is this batch

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.720
I didn't look into that in detail

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.240
But it's definitely that batch

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.600
There's definitely a problem here

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.920
A Ming

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.920
Pass the word down

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.520
Pull this problematic batch from shelves

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.160
Okay

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.000
A Qiang

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.560
Whatever it takes,

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.080
get me the cans of the formula involved

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.880
Check again

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.720
Okay

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.000
Zhiyi

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.880
Please make a trip to the formula factory

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.160
Bring their quality inspection director

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.560
and the outbound supervisor to come over

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.840
I need to investigate this from the start

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:20.720
Okay

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.840
I'll contact them now

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.840
Don't panic

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.680
Okay

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.880
Great

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.920
Brother

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.880
The public outcry is huge right now

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.080
And many families

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.720
have started coming out to demand answers

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.600
Not enough

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.960
Far from enough

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.560
Here is the plan

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.960
Go to the TV station

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.640
Find Reporter Jiang

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.880
He is my friend

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.840
Have him back you up

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.400
I want all Haicheng news media

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.960
to report this

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.240
Once it gets big enough,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.560
he, Zheng Nanfeng,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.040
even with three heads and six arms, will not escape

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.800
Okay, I'll go now

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.600
Wait

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.960
Then go arrange some people

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.360
Find those moms

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.880
Have them call the Bureau of Market Regulation

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.800
and the Administration for Industry and Commerce to complain

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.640
and write complaint letters

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.440
Okay

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.520
Brother Nanfeng

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.480
People from the Administration for Industry and Commerce are here

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.400
You are Mr. Zheng Nanfeng, right?

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.680
That is me

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.120
We are with the Administration for Industry and Commerce

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:32.840
We received a complaint

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.880
There is a batch of tainted milk powder

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.800
was transported in through your company's dock

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.120
We will now, by law, investigate and sanction your company

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.840
and ask you to cooperate with our next steps

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.200
Okay

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.920
I miss you

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.840
Whenever dusk comes

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.720
the evening wind blows

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.560
I miss you

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.560
The riddle of life

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.680
Try not to see it clearly

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.080
Close your eyes

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.280
Do not respond

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.280
The evening wind blows and blows

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.960
Go with the wind

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.400
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.560
Do not cry in secret

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.400
The evening wind blows and blows

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.080
Go with the wind

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.240
With nightfall and stars,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.240
drift gently to sleep

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.680
Let the evening wind blow
