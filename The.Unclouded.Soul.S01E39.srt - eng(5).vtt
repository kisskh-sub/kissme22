[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.729
[Episode 39]

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.300
Are there any demons left?

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.150
You're too late.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.930
The humans have taken everything
worth taking.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.800
I'm the only one left—

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.090
an old demon with no spiritual energy.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.680
How long have you been here?

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.120
I've lived too long.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.890
I've forgotten the time.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.520
Which clan are you from?

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.840
I'm too old.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.530
I've forgotten my clan's name too.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.690
What's the use of remembering anyway?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.000
I am the last member

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.370
of my clan.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.560
All of my clansmen

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.640
were killed

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.800
a long time ago.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.870
I'm the only one left,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.540
surviving in hiding until now.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.140
When I die,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.560
my clan

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.560
will disappear

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.120
from this world.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.370
Old Sir.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.290
Is your clan

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.710
Qiong Qi?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.960
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.900
I thought the world
had forgotten the Qiong Qi.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.990
Wait.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.030
I think I've seen you before.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.870
You seem familiar.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.950
The Qiong Qi King is still alive.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.640
The Qiong Qi King is still alive!

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.040
I'm not the only Qiong Qi left!

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.120
I'm not the only Qiong Qi left!

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.370
Old Sir.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.390
Old Sir!

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.580
The Primordial Pearl has become like this.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.050
Is your name really

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.380
just "Old"?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.550
Human cowards!

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.960
Set up the array!

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.510
Thank you.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.270
What about what you promised me?

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.880
It's been too long since I carved.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.410
My hands are a bit clumsy now.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.380
I knew it.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.660
The one you love

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.880
is still the old Pianpian.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.550
Since I changed my heart,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.800
you've never called me Pianpian again.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.140
I can never go back.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:58.660
But you're different.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.870
You still have a chance.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.740
This is an ancient great demon

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.400
with extraordinary power.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.530
The human emperor hunts demons
across the land for elixir refining,

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.400
but doesn't have even a tenth
of an ancient demon's power.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.400
While his power hasn't dissipated,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.840
if you consume his heart now,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.020
you can gain his power,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.580
strengthen yourself,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.760
and fight the Demon King.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.690
If I consume a demon's heart,

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.030
am I still human

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.600
or a demon?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.910
I'll tell you my second wish now.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.560
You must become stronger

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.870
so I won't lose you

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.530
in the battle against demons.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.360
You said

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.180
you would take care of me for life.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.760
I want you to keep that promise!

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.120
This beach

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.470
and sea

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.120
is just like it was 10,000 years ago—

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.030
it hasn't changed at all.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.050
Since the day I was born,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.500
I've had an irreconcilable stance
against humans.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.220
But only today did I learn

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.920
that I am human myself.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.510
And the one who caused humans and demons

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.080
to fight for 10,000 years,

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.030
turned out to be me.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.450
The root cause of the conflict

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.630
is the Yuli Spring.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.340
For thousands of years,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.370
you've been atoning for your sins.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.480
What you owed to the demons

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.200
has been repaid.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.540
You say that over these 10,000 years,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.920
everything changed.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.210
But the sea and the beach didn't.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.030
But there is actually one more thing

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.910
that has remained the same

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.210
as it was 10,000 years ago—

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.570
my love for you.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.860
This is the Dragon Essence Pearl
from back then.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.430
It represents

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.120
life.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.670
Humans.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.120
What happened to

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.720
Mount Fajiu?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.570
Hello?

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.630
Is anyone alive?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.720
Hello?

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.630
How strange.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.960
Why do you look so healthy?

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.000
You must be an immortal.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.160
I'm not an immortal.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.750
I'm a demon.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.610
It doesn't matter.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.480
We're all going to die anyway.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.599
You're not afraid of me?

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:08.550
How boring.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:11.910
Let me ask you.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:13.589
Did some disaster

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.310
strike this place?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.440
A plague...

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.750
A plague?

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.170
What kind of plague could be this bad?

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.300
There were too many disasters

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.250
all year round.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.350
When floods came,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.920
we fled to the mountains.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.440
When locusts came,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.020
we spent day and night
driving them away.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.590
We worked so hard,

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.200
yet harvested barely any grain.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.490
When there was a heavy rain
a few days ago,

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:52.200
a winged python was flushed down.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.000
And then?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.440
It was already dead.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.670
The villagers were desperate with hunger,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.750
so they skinned the python

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.660
and made soup to share.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.380
But the next day,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.290
a plague broke out in the village.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.680
Within three days,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.990
everyone in the village had died.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.100
That wasn't a python.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.850
It was one of the Teng She clan.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680
You shared a meal of demon flesh.

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.780
You deserved this calamity!

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.460
But that python was already dead.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.860
We needed to survive.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.380
Do you realize

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.270
that might have been my last clan member?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.440
Demon Lord.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.150
Our entire village
has already been punished.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.960
I'm dying too.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.640
Could I ask you

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.640
for a favor?

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.920
You want me to eat you?

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.270
My child!

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.420
He is still in the house...

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.350
Please...

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.420
Please, Demon Lord,

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.900
take him away from here

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.160
and let him live.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.550
Aren't you afraid

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.640
I'll eat him too?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.650
The child never drank python soup.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.000
He shouldn't be punished for it.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.680
Demon Lord,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.160
you look kind-hearted.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.880
You must be a good demon.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.510
I'm begging you.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.680
Please save a life.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.880
A good demon?

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.970
Demons who save humans

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.830
never meet a good end.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.530
Little one.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.510
Then go with

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.450
me.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.890
This must be the mirror fragment.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.400
Then this piece

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.880
must be "Sickness."

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.520
Why save that child?

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.590
He has no family left.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.000
What's the point of living?

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.400
That's for him

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.810
to decide.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.680
I

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.560
only need to make sure he stays alive.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.200
The human realm
is already full of suffering.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.900
Rather than growing up to face hardships,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.520
it's better to end it all now.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.670
Child!

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:24.680
Don't be afraid.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.330
I'm

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.830
with you...

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.090
Don't be scared.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.770
I'm with you.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.630
So this is what death feels like.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.510
Sister.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.930
I really wish

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.710
I could have one more

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.020
good and proper drink

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.310
with you.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.770
I hope in this world,

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.170
you can find your place,

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.160
away from conflicts and wandering,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.070
and remain true to yourself.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.130
Eliminate all evil.

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.830
I'm alive again?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.570
I'm not dead yet.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.030
This is the power of the Demon King.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480
Cut the nonsense.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.980
Go. Come with me.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.270
Where are we going?

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.530
We still have a chance.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.340
Let's return to Demons' Valley.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.290
There's still a chance?

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.440
Possibly.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:48.540
Let's go.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.880
Welcome, My Lord and Xiao Yao.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.200
You're back.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.400
Where are the others?

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.110
The three of them haven't returned yet.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.640
You're the first ones back.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.310
Come out.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.590
Coming.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.130
How did it go?

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.410
Did you find the mirror fragment?

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.340
By asking that,

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.510
I assume you've already found yours.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.110
Of course.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.930
Let me see it.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.310
What about yours?

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.250
I want to see it too.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.000
Sure.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.000
Why does yours

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.790
look different from mine?

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.770
Such petty tricks

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.920
cannot fool me.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.960
Why do you have

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.580
Qiong Qi and Teng She's aura on you?

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.840
Their power

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.110
is now all within me.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.610
Now it's your turn.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.990
My rivals for over 10,000 years,

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.300
are gone just like that.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.870
Perhaps it's for the best.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:46.620
From now on,

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.030
with no more rivals,

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.170
I have no more friends either!

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.440
Hand over your mirror fragment.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:38.620
Take it.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.250
Let's die together!

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:09.360
Pianpian.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:25.310
Pianpian.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:26.840
Pianpian!

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.880
Pianpian.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.510
Stop wasting your power.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.960
The crystal heart

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.900
is completely shattered.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.100
Don't worry.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.470
I'm still here.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.920
I'm with you.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.720
After I changed my heart...

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.550
my...

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.630
my chest often feels...

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.680
pain.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.920
Now...

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.840
I a-actually

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.960
feel relieved.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.610
Pianpian.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.270
Pianpian.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.020
I'll go find the Yuli Spring

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:31.650
and get the Kunlun Mirror.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.460
Wait for me.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.490
Bingzhu.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.350
I want

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.480
to see Tan'er one more time.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.670
Can I?

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.310
My last wish...

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.450
is for you...

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.560
and Tan'er...

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.270
to be

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.290
reunited.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.620
Pianpian.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.380
Pianpian!

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120
Pianpian.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.800
Pianpian, don't fall asleep.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:48.070
Pianpian...

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.430
Please look at me.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.790
The Yuli Spring...

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:08.890
Once I find the Yuli Spring,

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.630
everything will be fine.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:18.470
It will.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.670
Tan'er.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.730
Please take care of Pianpian for me.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.000
Wait for me.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.610
Hong Ye.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.220
Come out now!

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:43.260
Run!

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.980
Don't go yet.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.460
Wait for Ao Hen and the others to return.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.950
I'm afraid they won't be coming back.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.830
There is only one possibility

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.110
why his power has improved so rapidly.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.440
He absorbed Ao Hen,

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.590
Qiong Qi,

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.380
and Teng She's power.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.710
All the more you shouldn't be going out.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.510
Hong Ye,

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.070
come out now.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.630
Your barrier is about to collapse.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.400
This battle

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.080
is my destiny with him.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.500
Then promise me

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.030
that you'll return safely.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.870
Hong Ye,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.710
if you don't come out now,

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.800
Demons' Valley

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.610
will perish!

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.120
Don't be afraid.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:15.890
His Lordship will protect us.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:37.360
Demon King.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.530
Our two previous duels

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.370
were both interrupted.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760
This time,

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.110
no one can stop us.
