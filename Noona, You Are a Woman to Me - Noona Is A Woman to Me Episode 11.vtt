00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.540
(The younger men...)

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:10.750
(have more dilemmas after the age reveal.)

00:00:10.751 --> 00:00:14.821
(So do the older women.)

00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.451
(But they might be different.)

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.290
(I have a feeling...)

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.321
(there will definitely be a twist or change.)

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:25.230
(I keep thinking...)

00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.530
(you're approaching me even though you're not being serious.)

00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.371
I really can't tell how you feel.

(Shocked) Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.800
(Not being able to break free from such a thought...)

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.841
(makes it hard for me to do something.)

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.481
(Sang Hyeon misunderstood So Hyun's sincerity.)

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.211
(Were you not shocked after hearing my age?)

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.921
(It's impossible not to think things through...)

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:52.321
(when our age gap goes over 10 years.)

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:55.561
(Bon Hee and Mu Jin face the big age gap of 12 years.)

00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.760
(Right now, I'm only interested in you.)

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.641
(I want to go on a date with you and miss you.)

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.771
(The guy I was drawn to was you, Sang Won.)

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:08.571
(Sang Won's worry grows after Ye Eun and Ji Won's confessions.)

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.671
(The last morning after the age reveal before the final decision)

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.640
(The younger men are to choose one woman...)

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:19.281
(they want to talk to for each day and night.)

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:22.271
(After much consideration, the Day and Night Dates have begun.)

00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.620
(The older woman Sang Hyeon chose for his Day Date is...)

00:01:26.621 --> 00:01:29.721
(Bon Hee.)

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.991
(I know Bon Hee and Mu Jin are hitting it off well, )

00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:34.601
(but I wanted to talk to her more.)

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.400
(You have your strengths and weaknesses.)

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:40.031
(I thought you were very meticulous.)

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.670
(The ideal type I had in mind...)

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:49.911
(was Bon Hee.)

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.280
(The younger man who chose So Hyun for his Day Date is...)

00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:55.421
(Mu Jin.)

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.820
(I've wanted to talk to her.)

00:01:58.821 --> 00:01:59.891
(That's why I chose her.)

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:02.261
(When you joined, )

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.531
(I thought you were pretty...)

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.291
(and still very down to earth.)

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.471
(Would things have been different had I joined on the first day?)

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:12.170
(Thinking)

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.171
(Maybe.)

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.541
(So Hyun and Mu Jin shared an honest conversation.)

00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.751
(Sang Won is waiting for his Day Date partner.)

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.120
(The older woman Sang Won chose for his Day Date is...)

00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.721
(So Hyun.)

00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:32.220
(Her looks are close to my ideal type.)

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:35.261
(I could put in more effort.)

00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:40.130
- After the age reveal, - Yes?

00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.830
- it's total chaos in Yeon House. - Correct.

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:44.601
What's more, after Bon Hee and Mu Jin's...

00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:46.870
ages were revealed,

00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:48.840
Bon Hee said to Mu Jin while returning inside,

00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:51.371
- "You said you were old." - Exactly.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.170
Mu Jin wasn't taken aback by it all.

00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:54.380
- I know, right? - So as not to put Bon Hee...

00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:55.580
on the spot,

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:56.910
he asked if it was a shocker.

00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.010
(Was it a real shock?)

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.420
(Laughing)

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:01.621
- That was... - I know, right?

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.251
Mu Jin's way of talking must continue.

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.021
- It's no joke. - How charming.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:12.230
Sang Hyeon finally gets to have a 1-on-1 date with Bon Hee.

00:03:12.231 --> 00:03:14.460
I imagined something would happen...

00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:16.831
as Sang Hyeon kept wavering.

00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:18.730
But then, Sang Won chose So Hyun.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.500
That's causing many...

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:23.911
unexpected possibilities.

00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:25.341
It's unpredictable.

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:30.511
(The younger man's choice, Sang Won's Day Date)

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.681
Oh, gosh.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:36.780
(Who was Sang Won waiting for?)

00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:39.750
- I'm here. Goodness. - Hi.

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:40.760
(So Hyun)

00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:42.191
So Hyun has two dates.

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.561
Well...

00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:47.901
Were you surprised?

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.760
(Thinking)

00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:50.771
No.

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.800
Did you somewhat expect it?

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.370
(Thinking)

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:55.441
Yes.

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:57.071
I thought it could happen.

00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:59.171
We couldn't wrap up...

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:00.880
- our conversation. - In a rush?

00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:02.911
Yes, our chat was in a rush.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.850
- Just... - Here?

00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:07.680
- Yes, here isn't bad. - Oh, my gosh.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.120
I didn't know the two had such a moment.

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:14.261
It's just that we never had a 1-on-1 conversation.

00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.231
You're the most unpredictable person to me.

00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:19.891
- Is that so? Why? - Yes.

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:24.071
Why? You're simply hard to read.

00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:26.031
So I've been curious.

00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:29.301
Honestly...

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.611
I don't know where to start or how to put it.

00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:34.741
At first, I was...

00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:38.281
curious about you.

00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:40.727
- And very much at that. - He said "very much."

00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:42.111
- He was interested in her. - Yes.

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:43.380
- Actually... - Here's the thing.

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:44.490
(Sang Won was bummed out about yesterday's short talk.)

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:46.751
- Personally, at first, - Yes?

00:04:47.661 --> 00:04:49.690
The day you joined was when I had...

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:52.090
- the biggest mental breakdown. - I see.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.630
- Nobody chose him, right? - So...

00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:55.400
I had just made up my mind...

00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:57.031
to start anew from the very beginning.

00:04:58.101 --> 00:04:59.700
And someone with my physical ideal type joined,

00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:01.301
which made me think I had a chance.

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.371
I'm still upset about it. That day,

00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:05.770
I couldn't do much.

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.480
Even I realized I couldn't express my interest,

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:09.781
nor did I know how to do it.

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.380
Didn't he go grocery shopping alone?

00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:13.581
Yes.

00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:16.550
- Hello. - Look at his surprised eyes.

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:17.721
Did you just come?

00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:19.851
Yes, I'm a new participant.

00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:21.061
Hi.

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:23.930
- Hi. - He fell for her...

00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:25.260
right then and there.

00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:26.930
Like Korean, Chinese, and Western cuisine.

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:29.031
(Naturally, they had a chance to talk alone.)

00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:32.801
(Impatient, Sang Won bombarded So Hyun with questions...)

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:34.300
(and couldn't charm her at all.)

00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.970
That was him showing interest in her.

00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.140
- Yes. - Exactly.

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:38.671
Anyone could tell...

00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:42.740
you were a celebrity, and it was a first for me.

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:44.080
(Understanding)

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.751
I had my doubts.

00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:48.450
"Could she be serious about..."

00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:49.651
"such a show?"

00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:52.520
Sang Won is saying the same exact thing.

00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:54.990
Right? Everyone had the same thought.

00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.061
Exactly.

00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:59.531
(Could she be serious about such a show?)

00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:01.930
"I may be serious about it,"

00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:04.130
"but would she see me as a man?"

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.471
Such a worry filled me,

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.441
- I see. - and approaching you was...

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.741
In a way, I was being timid.

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.101
But those questions floated in my head.

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.080
Because of those cowardly thoughts,

00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:21.081
I believe I missed my chance.

00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:23.421
In another way,

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:26.751
I was being selfish.

00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.360
It may have been me not wanting to get hurt.

00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.661
That's the conclusion I came to.

00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:35.000
Say I expressed my feelings to someone.

00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:37.530
If she rejected it flatly,

00:06:37.531 --> 00:06:38.931
I wasn't sure if I could handle it.

00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:41.300
That crossed my mind as well.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.400
I didn't know back then, but did after a while.

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.670
(Sang Won opens his heart to So Hyun.)

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:47.271
- So as not to leave any regrets, - Yes?

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:49.340
I should try,

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:51.180
and if it doesn't work out, I should give up.

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:52.880
- Right. - When it comes to my emotions.

00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:54.361
- After all, this isn't work. - True.

00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:58.121
With that, I came to this decision.

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:01.191
Let's go all out right now.

00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:03.161
I should give it a shot.

00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:04.260
(Surprised)

00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:05.591
Oh, my goodness.

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:07.831
To think Director Park would...

00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.111
He has changed drastically.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:11.161
With that, I came to this decision.

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.840
(Let's go all out right now.)

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:16.970
I should give it a shot if I don't want to regret anything.

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.110
Even if it's for a day or two.

00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:21.411
Nothing has been set in stone yet.

00:07:21.611 --> 00:07:22.710
Even if you've made up your mind,

00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:24.681
I could change it.

00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:28.121
I'm going to set out passionately...

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:31.451
doing what I want and go where my heart leads me.

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:36.190
I'm learning about myself after joining Yeon House.

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:39.031
Is this the guys' growth place or what?

00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:42.130
(Sighing)

00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:43.731
I'm getting to know myself here.

00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.400
- Getting to know yourself. - But isn't that what dating is?

00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.370
- Yes. - Yes, that's what dating is.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:51.341
(Will he be able to show a changed self?)

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:55.610
Sang Won was being honest...

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:58.951
and told me about his regrets for the first time.

00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.350
I was grateful for how he mustered up the courage to do so.

00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.621
I'm sure she appreciated it.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:08.821
How nice it would have been if they had a little more time.

00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:11.060
- Right? - This is bad.

00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:13.730
Today, he frankly confessed that...

00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.661
he was determined to go all out at the last minute.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:21.041
Do you think he'll go after So Hyun until the very end?

00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:23.121
- What do you think? - After So Hyun?

00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:26.141
After saying that, he'll go on a Night Date with Ji Won.

00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:31.351
(Director Park is unpredictable.)

00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:33.950
(Ye Eun is alone at Yeon House.)

00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:35.051
- Ye Eun. - Oh, no.

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:40.820
The date is before the final decision tomorrow.

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:43.660
But not being selected...

00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:44.860
How upsetting.

00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:47.701
It upset me...

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.801
and took a heavy emotional toll.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:53.031
Oh, dear.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.040
(Ye Eun has come out to the terrace.)

00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.211
Is it to get some fresh air?

00:09:01.911 --> 00:09:02.911
Yes.

00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:09.921
(Sighing)

00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:18.130
(As her mind is a mess, )

00:09:18.131 --> 00:09:20.800
(she tries to dance it out.)

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:23.461
(she tries to dance it out.)

00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:37.911
(Sniffling)

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.990
(But she turns off the music shortly after.)

00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:47.760
Ye Eun tried to forget about it with ballet,

00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.360
- It didn't work. - but she couldn't calm herself.

00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:51.931
- She can't focus. I feel bad. - Tears keep falling down.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:01.500
(Ye Eun can't stop herself from choking up.)

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:03.270
- Of course it's upsetting. - Oh, no.

00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.371
(Ye Eun can't stop herself from choking up.)

00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:10.511
Do you know what happens in that situation?

00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:13.710
He chose someone else,

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.150
so it doesn't exactly mean he rejected her.

00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:17.951
Well, it is a rejection in a way.

00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:21.420
It makes you keep thinking,

00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:25.230
"Did I do something wrong?"

00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:26.891
and "Why wasn't I chosen?"

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:28.930
Right. Like, "What do I lack?"

00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:30.011
And it makes you regret it.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.471
(The Day Dates end.)

00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:35.841
The Night Dates.

00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.171
Who will be the first one to go on a Night Date.

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:43.241
(Sang Won was on the Day Date with So Hyun.)

00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:44.311
It's Sang Won.

00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:45.950
(Who did he choose to go on the Night Date with?)

00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.711
Who will go on the Night Date with Sang Won?

00:10:48.551 --> 00:10:49.651
I wonder who.

00:10:51.121 --> 00:10:52.751
We don't have much time left,

00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.160
so I chose the one that I was most attracted to...

00:10:55.161 --> 00:10:57.091
and that I had good chemistry with.

00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:02.060
I decided to be selfish about my feelings.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:03.230
(He focused on his feelings.)

00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:05.100
Maybe it's someone totally unexpected.

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:06.101
No way.

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:07.600
(His Night Date partner approaches him.)

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:08.841
That looks like Ji Won.

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:10.911
It was Ji Won.

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:14.010
- I waited forever. - Did you?

00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.811
- Take a seat. - Thank you.

00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:18.451
How long did you wait?

00:11:18.551 --> 00:11:19.680
I was joking. I didn't wait that long.

00:11:19.681 --> 00:11:20.711
Are you sure?

00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:22.580
You're dressed...

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.251
- How do I look? - very maturely.

00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:27.150
- Do I look mature? - Really?

00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:28.790
- It means he likes it. - It's a date, after all.

00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:30.220
He likes the way she's dressed.

00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:32.291
He seems a little tense, doesn't he?

00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:35.000
He was overwhelmed...

00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.601
- by how she entered. - Yes.

00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:38.601
Wait. Our food is here.

00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.271
Do you eat beef tartare?

00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:42.640
- I love it. - Thank you.

00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:44.841
You made a great choice. Thank you for the food.

00:11:45.641 --> 00:11:47.341
What should we try first?

00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:50.011
Do you want me to put the egg yolk on top?

00:11:50.381 --> 00:11:52.180
- Should we pop it together? - Yes.

00:11:52.181 --> 00:11:54.080
May I put it on top?

00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:55.120
Of course.

00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.220
They seem very comfortable.

00:11:56.221 --> 00:11:57.620
- Cheers. - Let's eat. Cheers.

00:11:57.621 --> 00:11:59.451
They're being playful too.

00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:02.821
(Satisfied)

00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:04.560
(Moaning)

00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:06.431
I hope it goes well.

00:12:08.701 --> 00:12:10.730
I had one last question for you.

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:11.731
Okay.

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:13.012
(Sang Won's question for Ji Won)

00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:16.341
I want to know how you felt after learning about our ages.

00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:17.770
I was younger than most.

00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:19.310
I was younger...

00:12:19.311 --> 00:12:20.741
- than people expected. - Right.

00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:24.511
I don't mind, actually.

00:12:27.051 --> 00:12:28.151
But it's like this.

00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:33.021
At the youthful age of 27...

00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:39.591
You could shine even brighter by dating someone your age,

00:12:40.161 --> 00:12:43.701
but my youthful days are over.

00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:48.000
Yes. And there are emotions...

00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.541
that you can feel when you're that age.

00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:57.080
I'm worried you might not feel that way about me.

00:12:57.081 --> 00:12:58.841
(What if he doesn't feel that way about me?)

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.851
You don't have to worry about that.

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:08.161
If I had wanted that,

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:13.331
and if I had thought I should date someone my age,

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:18.431
I wouldn't have come to Yeon House.

00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:20.471
So, that's not an issue.

00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:25.141
After the age reveal,

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.010
Ji Won seems more worried...

00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:29.340
about the other person...

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.487
- feeling burdened. - Indeed.

00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.950
Perhaps she asked Sang Won first...

00:13:33.951 --> 00:13:37.050
because she was worried. She probably asked...

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.491
to get confirmation.

00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:40.390
- Don't you think? - Like, "Please say you don't."

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.891
Right. Maybe that's what she thinks.

00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:44.161
When I was dating a younger guy,

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:46.230
I said something like that as well.

00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:47.960
But the reason was...

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.330
simply that I thought...

00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:51.471
he should be having fun with people his age.

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:53.970
That was what I meant.

00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:56.801
Why won't he be able to have fun while dating you, though?

00:13:57.001 --> 00:13:58.170
Because the environment changes.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:01.310
I used to go out and have fun,

00:14:01.311 --> 00:14:03.611
but I prefer quiet places now.

00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:05.250
Things change like that.

00:14:05.251 --> 00:14:07.751
Oh, you mean how the dates go.

00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:10.220
- Because he won't be able... - Right.

00:14:10.221 --> 00:14:11.990
To go on active and dynamic dates.

00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:13.850
Oh, you're right. You have a point.

00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:15.590
- I'm like, "Are you sure?" - We've all done it,

00:14:15.591 --> 00:14:16.871
- so it makes us tired. - Right.

00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:18.407
We don't want to go to crowded places.

00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:19.431
Why are you laughing?

00:14:20.061 --> 00:14:21.131
And to be honest...

00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.500
Also...

00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:25.181
(Ji Won wants to know how Sang Won feels.)

00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:28.400
When a man and a woman have feelings for each other,

00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:30.240
you can tell...

00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:33.441
from how they look at each other and their behaviors.

00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:37.041
But I wasn't sure...

00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:44.350
if I ever felt...

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:47.321
that you were completely into me.

00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:49.261
She's right.

00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:51.930
She's asking him to tell her...

00:14:51.931 --> 00:14:53.930
his honest feelings.

00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:55.601
- Something like that. - I see.

00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:59.731
- I was kind of confused. - What?

00:15:00.671 --> 00:15:02.601
- I was. - I get it, though.

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:05.440
- Because nothing has been set yet. - Right.

00:15:05.441 --> 00:15:07.541
- Yes. So... - We can't be sure about anything.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.151
I'm the type of person who needs certainty,

00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.251
so I felt anxious...

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:16.880
and had my doubts.

00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.620
She wants to know why he wasn't so proactive.

00:15:20.621 --> 00:15:24.430
I had one plan before coming here.

00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:26.590
If I felt that you were into me...

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:29.931
from the way you looked at me,

00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:31.171
I was going to go for it.

00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:33.131
If not,

00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:36.740
the chances of us being in a romantic relationship...

00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:39.041
Well, you said you wanted to keep an open mind.

00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:41.311
But I thought the chances were low.

00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:44.851
That's what I thought.

00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:48.480
So, I was going to make up my mind tonight.

00:15:48.481 --> 00:15:51.490
It was a crucial judgment.

00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:53.151
That's why I was so nervous...

00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.421
the whole time I waited.

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:58.731
That's why you need to express yourself.

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.301
I actually...

00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:04.471
thought lightly of coming here.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.051
"I just have to listen to my heart. What's so hard about that?"

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.041
But it turned out to be really difficult.

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:16.210
I was also disappointed in myself for how indecisive I was.

00:16:16.211 --> 00:16:17.771
(He's been indecisive the entire time.)

00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:20.411
It's so tricky and confusing.

00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:24.151
But I can't stand it when things are confusing.

00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:26.651
I'm not sure how he feels.

00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:28.491
It's so frustrating.

00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:32.831
That's her honest thought.

00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:34.861
I hope he knows this.

00:16:34.961 --> 00:16:36.030
Right.

00:16:36.031 --> 00:16:37.637
(Can Ji Won feel certain about Sang Won?)

00:16:37.661 --> 00:16:40.670
Who's the second person to go on the Night Date?

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:41.671
(The second Night Date)

00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:45.241
(Mu Jin went on a Day Date with So Hyun.)

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.141
(Would things have been different had I joined on the first day?)

00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:53.251
(Maybe.)

00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:57.250
It's Mu Jin!

00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:00.351
(Who did Mu Jin want to go on the Night Date with?)

00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:07.860
(Mu Jin still chose Bon Hee.)

00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.231
As expected.

00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:11.700
(Grinning)

00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:13.531
- He's so in love with her. - Goodness.

00:17:14.231 --> 00:17:15.241
Hey.

00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:21.241
(Mu Jin chose to go on the Night Date with Bon Hee.)

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.411
It feels like it's been a while.

00:17:25.881 --> 00:17:26.951
Where were you?

00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:31.051
I had coffee this afternoon.

00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:34.051
And then,

00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:35.991
I came here.

00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:42.201
What did you do?

00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:44.471
- I also had coffee. - Coffee?

00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:46.801
And I came here.

00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:52.610
Did you have a good talk during the Day Date?

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:53.811
Yes.

00:17:54.241 --> 00:17:55.481
Who did you go with?

00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:57.441
Sang Hyeon.

00:17:58.611 --> 00:17:59.811
- Sang Hyeon. - Yes.

00:18:00.251 --> 00:18:02.950
We had never met outside before,

00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:05.021
and we had only talked inside the Yeon House.

00:18:05.591 --> 00:18:07.191
So, he wanted to go out with me.

00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:10.661
He was very serious,

00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.330
but it was good that I talked to him today.

00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:15.331
Yes.

00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:21.511
Who did you go on the Day Date with?

00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:22.770
So Hyun.

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.971
I see. I thought so.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.341
- Did you have a feeling? - Yes.

00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:29.641
- You could feel it? - Yes.

00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:31.251
I see.

00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:34.981
It's good to talk to others. That's why we're all here.

00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.681
I had a good talk.

00:18:39.791 --> 00:18:40.791
So did I.

00:18:43.624 --> 00:18:44.906
It's a little awkward.

00:18:44.931 --> 00:18:46.691
(Staring)

00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:51.030
I think it gets awkward again...

00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:53.001
when we leave the Yeon House.

00:18:54.145 --> 00:18:55.171
It's a little awkward.

00:18:55.196 --> 00:18:57.191
(Staring)

00:18:58.815 --> 00:19:01.614
I think it gets awkward again...

00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:03.515
when we leave the Yeon House.

00:19:05.155 --> 00:19:06.655
It's a totally different vibe.

00:19:07.195 --> 00:19:09.695
Yes. And we're dressed differently there.

00:19:10.125 --> 00:19:12.765
(You're right.)

00:19:13.225 --> 00:19:14.465
Seeing you here...

00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.594
feels different.

00:19:16.595 --> 00:19:17.605
Right.

00:19:20.735 --> 00:19:22.635
You look pretty.

00:19:23.805 --> 00:19:25.574
He said the same thing on their first date.

00:19:25.575 --> 00:19:26.745
(Shy)

00:19:30.915 --> 00:19:32.785
Tomorrow is our last day.

00:19:33.245 --> 00:19:36.915
Right. It's so fascinating how time goes so fast.

00:19:39.225 --> 00:19:40.855
I have some regrets.

00:19:42.955 --> 00:19:44.165
It was fun.

00:19:45.525 --> 00:19:47.764
We can talk more tonight.

00:19:47.765 --> 00:19:48.895
Yes.

00:19:48.995 --> 00:19:50.805
Maybe it's because it's their last night,

00:19:50.965 --> 00:19:53.104
but don't they seem more cautious?

00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:55.035
(They seem more cautious than usual.)

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:57.975
When we revealed our ages yesterday,

00:20:00.245 --> 00:20:01.445
were you nervous?

00:20:03.145 --> 00:20:05.884
I think I was anxious.

00:20:05.885 --> 00:20:07.515
- What? - I was anxious.

00:20:08.085 --> 00:20:09.285
I see.

00:20:10.725 --> 00:20:11.884
(I'm 27.)

00:20:11.885 --> 00:20:13.794
(Gasping)

00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:15.054
(My name is Kim Mu Jin.)

00:20:15.055 --> 00:20:17.225
- She was genuinely startled. - She was.

00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:19.864
(Mu Jin's age startled her.)

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:21.565
He was younger than I thought.

00:20:22.865 --> 00:20:24.304
I had a feeling...

00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:26.464
that one of them could be up to 12 years younger than me,

00:20:26.465 --> 00:20:28.275
but I never knew that would be Mu Jin.

00:20:29.005 --> 00:20:32.845
Thinking about being in a relationship,

00:20:33.305 --> 00:20:36.215
I'm not so sure because I've never been in one.

00:20:36.315 --> 00:20:37.415
Right.

00:20:38.285 --> 00:20:40.455
Were you not shocked after hearing my age?

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:44.825
It's impossible not to think things through...

00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:49.195
when our age gap goes over ten years.

00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:51.394
- Poor them. - I'm just worried.

00:20:51.395 --> 00:20:52.995
Maybe they won't be matched.

00:20:53.995 --> 00:20:55.594
Her brother is 11 years younger,

00:20:55.595 --> 00:20:57.235
and Mu Jin is 12 years younger.

00:20:57.305 --> 00:20:59.834
She'd be dating a guy who's younger than her little brother.

00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:01.075
Also, do you know that?

00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:03.535
When the age difference is exactly 11 years,

00:21:04.145 --> 00:21:07.245
it's less mental pressure.

00:21:07.675 --> 00:21:09.045
But when you're 12 years older...

00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:12.244
and he has the same zodiac sign, it's a lot of pressure.

00:21:12.245 --> 00:21:14.485
It would have been better if he were younger.

00:21:14.785 --> 00:21:16.054
- Right! - Younger than 12 years?

00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:17.555
Yes, like 13 or 14 years younger.

00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:20.284
At that point, it's just meaningless to worry.

00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:22.524
- Right. - You wouldn't even care...

00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:24.541
- at that point... - They have the same zodiac sign.

00:21:24.565 --> 00:21:26.595
And just go for him.

00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:28.794
But it's different when you share the same zodiac sign.

00:21:28.795 --> 00:21:31.065
(I see.)

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.135
Are you worried about anything?

00:21:35.735 --> 00:21:37.575
- Worried? - Yes.

00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:42.214
(Thinking)

00:21:42.215 --> 00:21:44.544
I'd be lying to say that I'm not.

00:21:44.545 --> 00:21:46.944
Right. That's an honest answer.

00:21:46.945 --> 00:21:49.284
And Mu Jin is younger than most guys there.

00:21:49.285 --> 00:21:50.555
I thought...

00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:54.055
that there would be a big age difference,

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:56.124
but actually hearing it...

00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:58.494
(Even he didn't know they would be 12 years apart.)

00:21:58.495 --> 00:22:00.195
It's because she looks so young.

00:22:01.365 --> 00:22:02.435
Oh, man.

00:22:04.465 --> 00:22:06.565
While I was here,

00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:09.735
there weren't any terms when we talked to each other...

00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:12.745
and grew feelings.

00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:15.844
But would I be able to date you...

00:22:15.845 --> 00:22:18.514
outside of this program...

00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:21.955
regardless of what people think?

00:22:23.185 --> 00:22:25.284
I was slightly worried about that.

00:22:25.285 --> 00:22:26.954
(He was worried about what people would think...)

00:22:26.955 --> 00:22:28.625
(about the 12-year age difference.)

00:22:29.895 --> 00:22:31.224
But I was still curious about you.

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:32.795
(He's still curious about Bon Hee.)

00:22:33.565 --> 00:22:35.365
Bon Hee is keeping a straight face, though.

00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:36.634
- She is. - Yes.

00:22:36.635 --> 00:22:40.205
Judging from the emotions I felt,

00:22:41.605 --> 00:22:44.144
I thought we could make it work.

00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.905
What I was more worried about was...

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:49.415
you than myself.

00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:53.115
You could be more worried...

00:22:54.585 --> 00:22:56.315
than I would be.

00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:58.954
That's what concerned me.

00:22:58.955 --> 00:23:00.675
(He was worried she might change her mind.)

00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:03.225
Things might be harder when this ends,

00:23:03.925 --> 00:23:05.995
even with the feelings we've shared.

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:11.665
Do I look like I'm worried?

00:23:12.505 --> 00:23:15.075
(Thinking)

00:23:18.475 --> 00:23:19.905
I have a good eye for people.

00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:21.575
What do you think?

00:23:23.645 --> 00:23:25.014
I'm not so sure today.

00:23:25.015 --> 00:23:27.915
(I'm not so sure today.)

00:23:29.715 --> 00:23:31.354
Just like I said,

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:33.685
it's true that I'm worried.

00:23:34.025 --> 00:23:35.525
I'm naturally concerned.

00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:38.095
And I'm cautious about this.

00:23:38.695 --> 00:23:40.294
It's a completely different stage...

00:23:40.295 --> 00:23:42.595
when this program ends.

00:23:42.995 --> 00:23:44.564
We're more immersed...

00:23:44.565 --> 00:23:47.434
in our feelings because we're in Yeon House.

00:23:47.435 --> 00:23:48.475
Yes.

00:23:48.905 --> 00:23:51.575
I think it's a different issue once the show is over.

00:23:57.715 --> 00:24:00.084
Anyway, tomorrow, we'll make...

00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:01.454
(They don't have much time left in Yeon House.)

00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:02.955
something like the final decision.

00:24:04.785 --> 00:24:06.424
Whatever decision you make,

00:24:06.425 --> 00:24:09.754
(Whatever decision Bon Hee makes...)

00:24:09.755 --> 00:24:13.095
(Whatever decision Bon Hee makes...)

00:24:13.695 --> 00:24:14.965
I'll accept it...

00:24:16.665 --> 00:24:17.905
and respect you for it.

00:24:21.205 --> 00:24:22.335
It's tough.

00:24:22.935 --> 00:24:24.005
Thanks.

00:24:25.905 --> 00:24:28.944
(Can they overcome their age difference?)

00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:30.414
I'm not sure what he means.

00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:32.784
What he said in the end...

00:24:32.785 --> 00:24:34.414
makes you think.

00:24:34.415 --> 00:24:37.355
They talked honestly...

00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:40.725
about the things they must overcome...

00:24:41.095 --> 00:24:43.395
in the future.

00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:46.324
But he didn't say,

00:24:46.325 --> 00:24:49.595
"But you were the only one for me from beginning to end."

00:24:49.965 --> 00:24:52.934
He said, "I'll respect whatever decision you make."

00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:55.275
- That sounds very neutral. - Indeed.

00:24:55.475 --> 00:24:56.974
And she had...

00:24:56.975 --> 00:24:59.174
a subtle look when he said that.

00:24:59.175 --> 00:25:01.114
She didn't seem so happy.

00:25:01.115 --> 00:25:03.515
It looked like she wanted to hide her feelings.

00:25:04.685 --> 00:25:07.555
She must have wanted him to hold on to her.

00:25:08.515 --> 00:25:11.825
She's like, "He's always been so straightforward with me,"

00:25:12.285 --> 00:25:14.005
"and now he's saying this on the last day?"

00:25:16.455 --> 00:25:18.394
(The third Night Date...)

00:25:18.395 --> 00:25:21.465
(chosen by the younger guy)

00:25:22.135 --> 00:25:24.534
(Hyeon Jun was on a Day Date with Ji Won.)

00:25:24.535 --> 00:25:25.765
It's Hyeon Jun.

00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:29.974
- It must be Yeong Gyeong, right? - Yeong Gyeong.

00:25:29.975 --> 00:25:31.304
- I think so. - Right.

00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:33.621
(He's waiting for the older woman to go on a Night Date with.)

00:25:33.645 --> 00:25:36.775
I don't think we know each other well enough.

00:25:37.215 --> 00:25:38.985
I wanted to eat delicious food with her...

00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:42.054
and have a serious conversation.

00:25:42.055 --> 00:25:44.095
(He wants to have a serious conversation with her.)

00:25:44.855 --> 00:25:47.854
(Who's the woman he wants to have a serious chat with...)

00:25:47.855 --> 00:25:49.724
(during the Night Date?)

00:25:49.725 --> 00:25:50.864
It was Yeong Gyeong.

00:25:50.865 --> 00:25:52.525
(Yeong Gyeong)

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:54.234
(A bright smile)

00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:55.834
- He's smiling so big already. - Look at his face.

00:25:55.835 --> 00:25:57.405
- Look at that. - Oh, my gosh.

00:25:57.665 --> 00:25:59.004
Good luck, Hyeon Jun.

00:25:59.005 --> 00:26:01.035
(Shy)

00:26:02.575 --> 00:26:03.605
Hi.

00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:05.774
- Hi. - You came in so suddenly.

00:26:05.775 --> 00:26:08.975
(Hyeon Jun didn't change his mind and chose Yeong Gyeong.)

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:16.055
(Feeling a bit awkward)

00:26:16.885 --> 00:26:18.125
What did you do this afternoon?

00:26:18.525 --> 00:26:20.031
- What? - What did you do this afternoon?

00:26:20.055 --> 00:26:21.595
He's cracking down on her.

00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:24.071
- This afternoon? - "Who did you go on a date with?"

00:26:24.095 --> 00:26:25.965
- It's a secret. - I see.

00:26:28.135 --> 00:26:29.135
Okay.

00:26:30.695 --> 00:26:32.265
(Stopping)

00:26:32.835 --> 00:26:33.934
What?

00:26:33.935 --> 00:26:38.074
I feel like it's been ages since we ate like this.

00:26:38.075 --> 00:26:40.515
I think it's our first time ever coming to a place like this.

00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:44.145
So, how do you feel?

00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:46.914
I could have gone...

00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:49.184
on two dates today, right?

00:26:49.185 --> 00:26:50.215
But...

00:26:50.685 --> 00:26:53.155
I chose you for the Night Date on purpose.

00:26:53.525 --> 00:26:57.024
I believed I could spend more time with you that way.

00:26:57.025 --> 00:26:58.894
(I believed I could spend more time with you that way.)

00:26:58.895 --> 00:27:02.665
This is a very important dinner for me.

00:27:03.395 --> 00:27:04.464
He's honest.

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:05.605
- Is it now? - Yes.

00:27:06.335 --> 00:27:08.204
So, I hope you take this seriously.

00:27:08.205 --> 00:27:10.635
- I must take it seriously. - I'm joking.

00:27:10.905 --> 00:27:12.644
(He jokingly tells her how he really feels.)

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:13.775
I'm joking.

00:27:15.115 --> 00:27:17.615
Our ages were revealed last night.

00:27:18.015 --> 00:27:19.144
But...

00:27:19.145 --> 00:27:23.055
I don't think I actually heard about your thoughts.

00:27:23.385 --> 00:27:25.055
So, I was curious about that.

00:27:26.155 --> 00:27:28.355
I was wondering what was on your mind.

00:27:28.855 --> 00:27:30.055
I want to know...

00:27:30.825 --> 00:27:34.265
what you want to do from here on out.

00:27:35.695 --> 00:27:36.934
(He asked her about marriage...)

00:27:36.935 --> 00:27:38.264
(after the age reveal last night.)

00:27:38.265 --> 00:27:39.865
It seemed unclear at that moment, right?

00:27:40.165 --> 00:27:41.274
It did.

00:27:41.275 --> 00:27:44.845
(I think marriage is about stability.)

00:27:45.175 --> 00:27:48.645
(He prioritized stability in marriage.)

00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:51.685
(What I can tell you for sure is...)

00:27:51.985 --> 00:27:55.454
(that I never want to be in a marriage...)

00:27:55.455 --> 00:27:56.784
(that only looks good on the outside.)

00:27:56.785 --> 00:27:59.854
(I'd rather live alone than do that...)

00:27:59.855 --> 00:28:03.955
(because I'm already living a happy life by myself.)

00:28:04.595 --> 00:28:05.924
(They had different goals...)

00:28:05.925 --> 00:28:07.164
(regarding marriage.)

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:09.364
Numerous single women...

00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:11.434
think that.

00:28:11.435 --> 00:28:12.565
I want to know...

00:28:13.205 --> 00:28:16.675
what you want to do from here on out.

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:19.144
He's bringing it up again.

00:28:19.145 --> 00:28:21.074
- What I want to do? - Yes.

00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:22.075
(Flustered)

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.145
You asked me so suddenly...

00:28:25.015 --> 00:28:27.555
and put me on the spot.

00:28:30.285 --> 00:28:31.784
- Here are your drinks. - Thank you.

00:28:31.785 --> 00:28:33.055
- And this is... - It's hers.

00:28:35.095 --> 00:28:36.095
Thanks.

00:28:37.625 --> 00:28:38.865
- Enjoy. - Sure.

00:28:39.595 --> 00:28:42.295
What else do you want to know other than that?

00:28:42.665 --> 00:28:44.235
I'll ask you later.

00:28:44.405 --> 00:28:45.765
After I hear your answer.

00:28:46.665 --> 00:28:48.674
She tried to move on,

00:28:48.675 --> 00:28:50.275
- but he wouldn't let her. - Right.

00:28:51.675 --> 00:28:53.944
(Thinking)

00:28:53.945 --> 00:28:57.015
If I had good feelings about it,

00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:02.055
I would express it in some way.

00:29:03.255 --> 00:29:06.425
(Her answer is a bit ambiguous.)

00:29:06.725 --> 00:29:09.424
That must come first for Hyeon Jun.

00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:10.924
- It must be his top priority. - He's in a rush.

00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:13.894
I guess building a family is an essential factor...

00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:15.694
- I think so. - for his ideal life.

00:29:15.695 --> 00:29:18.435
- It must matter the most. - Right. But...

00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:22.905
I told you once that I was interested in you.

00:29:23.835 --> 00:29:27.545
I think you know that clearly now.

00:29:28.315 --> 00:29:30.815
I'm wondering how you express your feelings...

00:29:31.385 --> 00:29:34.015
when you're interested in someone.

00:29:34.785 --> 00:29:36.885
The thing is... Well...

00:29:37.925 --> 00:29:39.525
(Thinking)

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:42.225
To tell you the truth... Well...

00:29:45.225 --> 00:29:48.395
The answer to your question...

00:29:50.295 --> 00:29:53.705
will be revealed tomorrow.

00:29:54.705 --> 00:29:58.044
It will be revealed tomorrow.

00:29:58.045 --> 00:29:59.504
(Realizing)

00:29:59.505 --> 00:30:01.074
- That's what I think. - I'm curious.

00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:02.745
But that reaction is quite...

00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:06.784
Her answer could mean something significant.

00:30:06.785 --> 00:30:07.854
I have no idea what it means.

00:30:07.855 --> 00:30:10.115
(What does Yeong Gyeong's answer mean?)

00:30:11.525 --> 00:30:14.455
You said you lived in Gyeongsang Province.

00:30:15.725 --> 00:30:16.885
Where in Gyeongsang Province?

00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:18.824
- May I ask? - I live in Gyeongju.

00:30:18.825 --> 00:30:20.265
- Gyeongju? - Yes.

00:30:21.695 --> 00:30:23.094
- That's far. - Indeed.

00:30:23.095 --> 00:30:27.674
I also want to know what you think about a long-distance relationship.

00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:29.195
- A long-distance relationship? - Yes.

00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:32.704
Actually, I've never been in a long-distance relationship.

00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:35.275
(Yeong Gyeong has never been in a long-distance relationship.)

00:30:36.545 --> 00:30:37.985
Do you have any experience?

00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:40.325
No, I have no experience either.

00:30:40.745 --> 00:30:41.945
I've never been in one either.

00:30:42.055 --> 00:30:44.254
But I often come...

00:30:44.255 --> 00:30:46.385
to Seoul or Bundang.

00:30:47.085 --> 00:30:49.394
I'm used to going to those areas.

00:30:49.395 --> 00:30:51.495
So it's not hard for me to come.

00:30:52.295 --> 00:30:54.465
I can always come to Seoul when I need to.

00:30:54.865 --> 00:30:56.895
So it won't be a problem to me.

00:30:58.035 --> 00:31:00.434
(The reality feels more real on the last date.)

00:31:00.435 --> 00:31:02.734
I haven't seen those looks...

00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:06.204
on Yeong Gyeong's face before.

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:09.745
She looks like she's finally facing the reality.

00:31:12.345 --> 00:31:13.645
This isn't easy.

00:31:13.985 --> 00:31:15.384
Seul Hye,

00:31:15.385 --> 00:31:18.885
if you were Yeong Gyeong, how would you feel?

00:31:19.325 --> 00:31:22.154
A seven-year age gap wouldn't be an issue to me.

00:31:22.155 --> 00:31:24.031
- So the age gap is not an issue. - I wouldn't mind the age gap.

00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:25.824
- A long-distance relationship... - Four hours.

00:31:25.825 --> 00:31:27.294
If I were in a four-hour long-distance relationship...

00:31:27.295 --> 00:31:28.494
"I can go that far."

00:31:28.495 --> 00:31:30.375
Some people don't go after saying such a thing.

00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:32.634
It would work if he's a man who keeps his promises.

00:31:32.635 --> 00:31:35.174
While getting to know him,

00:31:35.175 --> 00:31:38.604
I would see what type of person he is over time,

00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:39.904
and then I'd decide...

00:31:39.905 --> 00:31:41.174
whether to date him.

00:31:41.175 --> 00:31:42.175
That's wise.

00:31:42.176 --> 00:31:43.274
What's gotten into me?

00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:45.114
(Why am I doing so well today?)

00:31:45.115 --> 00:31:47.144
The comment you made earlier was also very good.

00:31:47.145 --> 00:31:49.654
You sound like a dating expert.

00:31:49.655 --> 00:31:52.231
(Instructor Hwangwoo Seul Hye, a long-distance relationship expert)

00:31:52.255 --> 00:31:57.095
(The fourth Night Date chosen by a younger man)

00:31:57.655 --> 00:32:01.834
(Ji Yung had his Day Date with Yeong Gyeong.)

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:03.471
Even many of those who lived in Australia don't know.

00:32:03.495 --> 00:32:05.105
Is it Ji Yung's Night Date?

00:32:05.535 --> 00:32:07.264
- Who could it be? So Hyun? - So Hyun.

00:32:07.265 --> 00:32:09.275
- It must be So Hyun. - It could be Bon Hee.

00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:11.144
- No, it must be So Hyun. - So Hyun?

00:32:11.145 --> 00:32:12.175
Yes, So Hyun.

00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:14.004
He seems nervous.

00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:15.685
(He arrived early and is waiting for her.)

00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:20.984
Hello.

00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:23.415
(Ji Yung smiles while looking nervous.)

00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:26.324
(The one Ji Yung chose for his Night Date is...)

00:32:26.325 --> 00:32:28.205
It's raining outside. Didn't you get rained on?

00:32:28.455 --> 00:32:29.555
No, I didn't.

00:32:30.455 --> 00:32:32.964
- Did you wait long? - No, just a bit.

00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:33.965
Just a bit?

00:32:36.235 --> 00:32:40.065
Thank you for choosing me...

00:32:41.005 --> 00:32:42.675
for your last date.

00:32:44.135 --> 00:32:47.175
I always go only in the same direction.

00:32:47.915 --> 00:32:51.144
(Ji Yung has been proved to be straightforward.)

00:32:51.145 --> 00:32:52.245
How many dates...

00:32:53.445 --> 00:32:55.115
did you go on earlier today?

00:32:55.685 --> 00:32:56.814
I was so curious about it.

00:32:56.815 --> 00:32:58.554
- Today? - I think you were chosen by many.

00:32:58.555 --> 00:32:59.555
Really?

00:33:01.455 --> 00:33:02.625
He must be curious about it.

00:33:02.825 --> 00:33:04.665
I went on many dates today.

00:33:05.895 --> 00:33:07.455
I met several guys I needed to talk to.

00:33:08.965 --> 00:33:10.034
He seems sad and disappointed.

00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:14.735
Were there any other girls...

00:33:16.835 --> 00:33:19.505
that you went on a date with or talked to?

00:33:21.145 --> 00:33:22.945
On the day after I moved in,

00:33:24.615 --> 00:33:25.915
you joined the show.

00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:29.615
We had the 5-on-1 date next day.

00:33:29.915 --> 00:33:32.285
That day, you left a deep impression on me.

00:33:32.755 --> 00:33:34.955
Since then, I've been committed to you.

00:33:34.995 --> 00:33:36.695
I tried hard to get a date ticket.

00:33:37.255 --> 00:33:38.524
I barely managed to get one.

00:33:38.525 --> 00:33:41.001
(He tried to win only So Hyun's heart since he first met her.)

00:33:41.025 --> 00:33:44.564
I started to express my feelings even before I knew.

00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:46.404
(Ji Yung showed his interest consistently inside Yeon House too.)

00:33:46.405 --> 00:33:49.375
It might've made you uncomfortable.

00:33:49.805 --> 00:33:52.175
But you always treated me nicely.

00:33:52.345 --> 00:33:53.844
- Well... - Thank you for that.

00:33:53.845 --> 00:33:56.175
You don't have to thank me. I mean... How should I put it?

00:33:56.675 --> 00:33:58.085
I was worried...

00:33:58.545 --> 00:33:59.945
if I didn't tell you clearly...

00:34:00.745 --> 00:34:03.385
about how I felt about you,

00:34:03.955 --> 00:34:07.455
which could give you false hope,

00:34:07.925 --> 00:34:09.405
considering we didn't have much time.

00:34:11.965 --> 00:34:13.565
- That wasn't the case. - Is that so?

00:34:13.865 --> 00:34:17.695
Rather, you told me honestly right away.

00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:22.104
And that made me fall for you even more deeply.

00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:23.175
"I was right about her."

00:34:25.045 --> 00:34:28.814
"That's the person who I thought So Hyun was."

00:34:28.815 --> 00:34:30.291
(Ji Yung liked that she rejected him in her own way.)

00:34:30.315 --> 00:34:31.545
I liked that about you.

00:34:31.885 --> 00:34:34.165
- I rather liked that. - He likes her and no other girls.

00:34:38.125 --> 00:34:40.425
You're very mature.

00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:43.554
You think in a mature way.

00:34:43.555 --> 00:34:46.124
After we had that conversation,

00:34:46.125 --> 00:34:47.935
I felt so relieved.

00:34:50.295 --> 00:34:51.304
I left no regrets.

00:34:51.305 --> 00:34:53.104
(Even so, I left no regrets.)

00:34:53.105 --> 00:34:55.334
I showed you who I was.

00:34:55.335 --> 00:34:56.505
Did she just reject him?

00:34:56.735 --> 00:34:57.975
He just feels that way.

00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:00.005
I think it's a good thing.

00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:01.205
- Are you serious? - Yes.

00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:03.545
I was surprised how mature he was.

00:35:03.915 --> 00:35:06.715
He must've been hurt and emotionally suffering,

00:35:06.985 --> 00:35:10.955
but despite that, he seemed to try to be considerate of my feelings.

00:35:11.425 --> 00:35:12.485
I was very grateful.

00:35:13.525 --> 00:35:15.395
I felt apologetic toward him at the same time.

00:35:15.555 --> 00:35:16.894
But I was more grateful than apologetic.

00:35:16.895 --> 00:35:18.975
(She felt apologetic and grateful at the same time.)

00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:21.495
Who's left?

00:35:21.496 --> 00:35:23.336
(The fifth Night Date chosen by a younger man)

00:35:24.465 --> 00:35:25.704
- Sang Hyeon. - Sang Hyeon.

00:35:25.705 --> 00:35:27.425
(Sang Hyeon had his Day Date with Bon Hee.)

00:35:28.005 --> 00:35:31.134
(You have your strengths and weaknesses.)

00:35:31.135 --> 00:35:32.745
(I thought you were meticulous.)

00:35:33.745 --> 00:35:38.185
(The ideal type I had in mind is...)

00:35:38.285 --> 00:35:40.545
(Bon Hee.)

00:35:42.255 --> 00:35:44.285
This is Sang Hyeon's Night Date.

00:35:44.455 --> 00:35:45.815
- It should be So Hyun. - So Hyun.

00:35:46.555 --> 00:35:47.684
It might not be So Hyun.

00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:53.095
(He's waiting for the older woman he chose.)

00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:56.195
What was it? Capri...

00:35:56.535 --> 00:35:57.794
"Capri?"

00:35:57.795 --> 00:35:59.935
- Caprile? - What?

00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:02.535
Capris? Ca...

00:36:03.005 --> 00:36:04.035
Caprise.

00:36:06.605 --> 00:36:07.605
He's cute.

00:36:07.775 --> 00:36:10.415
- Oh, he doesn't know caprese salad. - Caprise.

00:36:15.985 --> 00:36:17.085
You're here.

00:36:17.215 --> 00:36:19.085
Hi.

00:36:20.725 --> 00:36:23.224
- Did you wait long? - I just got here too.

00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:24.324
Really?

00:36:24.325 --> 00:36:25.871
(Sang Hyeon chose So Hyun as expected.)

00:36:25.895 --> 00:36:27.364
- How many dates did she go on? - So Hyun...

00:36:27.365 --> 00:36:29.664
- Exactly. - Right. She's been busy today.

00:36:29.665 --> 00:36:30.994
She had four dates.

00:36:30.995 --> 00:36:32.865
So Hyun is very popular.

00:36:33.605 --> 00:36:34.705
I'm jealous.

00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:38.005
The cardigan you're wearing looks nice.

00:36:38.105 --> 00:36:42.414
Oh, this? Thank you. You look nicer than me.

00:36:42.415 --> 00:36:43.545
I always look nice.

00:36:46.845 --> 00:36:49.555
I think you waited long. Didn't you?

00:36:49.855 --> 00:36:50.955
No, I didn't wait long.

00:36:51.755 --> 00:36:54.254
I was memorizing the name of the dish to tell you.

00:36:54.255 --> 00:36:55.455
- Come again? - Capril...

00:36:56.025 --> 00:36:57.954
- Caprise. - Caprese.

00:36:57.955 --> 00:36:58.964
Cap...

00:36:58.965 --> 00:36:59.965
(Embarrassed)

00:36:59.966 --> 00:37:01.734
Oh, you know. I've never tried this before.

00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:03.464
- Capri... -Really? Caprese.

00:37:03.465 --> 00:37:05.065
- Caprese. - Caprese... And...

00:37:05.235 --> 00:37:07.404
I also ordered pork belly, and this is what I wanted to have.

00:37:07.405 --> 00:37:08.934
It's mala rose tteokbokki. It was on the menu.

00:37:08.935 --> 00:37:10.611
(Although he doesn't know the names of dishes...)

00:37:10.635 --> 00:37:13.145
Did you choose this restaurant?

00:37:13.275 --> 00:37:14.404
Yes.

00:37:14.405 --> 00:37:16.645
(He chose the dishes himself while thinking of So Hyun.)

00:37:16.675 --> 00:37:17.675
Mala?

00:37:18.315 --> 00:37:21.615
I can't really handle mala sauce.

00:37:22.385 --> 00:37:24.314
- You can't eat it? - It's not that I can't eat it.

00:37:24.315 --> 00:37:25.684
- He's flustered. - I just don't...

00:37:25.685 --> 00:37:27.784
I don't understand what people like so much about it.

00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:28.955
- You don't? - No.

00:37:29.655 --> 00:37:33.194
My favorite dishes are all made with mala sauce.

00:37:33.195 --> 00:37:35.635
- Like malatang, mala xiang guo, - Really?

00:37:36.435 --> 00:37:38.705
And mala tteokbokki. I love them all.

00:37:38.835 --> 00:37:41.164
- It's a good choice in most cases. - Exactly.

00:37:41.165 --> 00:37:43.634
It's really unlikely that your date doesn't like it.

00:37:43.635 --> 00:37:45.204
- That's right. - But she doesn't like it.

00:37:45.205 --> 00:37:47.905
- Try the other dishes. - I will. I'll try the other dishes.

00:37:48.315 --> 00:37:50.144
- Can you cut this in pieces? - I'll cut it for you.

00:37:50.145 --> 00:37:51.684
Slice it for me.

00:37:51.685 --> 00:37:52.785
Slice it nicely.

00:37:53.045 --> 00:37:54.584
See? She's acting cute.

00:37:54.585 --> 00:37:56.454
So Hyun is giving off a totally different vibe.

00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:58.824
She met Mu Jin earlier in the daytime.

00:37:58.825 --> 00:38:00.485
She met other guys too, though.

00:38:01.055 --> 00:38:04.194
"But Mu Jin has Bon Hee."

00:38:04.195 --> 00:38:07.724
"He chose me for his Day Date, but I'm not his first choice."

00:38:07.725 --> 00:38:10.005
That's how she seemed to be feeling. But now, she's like,

00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:12.604
"I'm finally where I belong."

00:38:12.605 --> 00:38:14.925
(She seems comfortable as if she were where she belonged.)

00:38:15.405 --> 00:38:17.274
You've got something on your lip.

00:38:17.275 --> 00:38:18.545
- Really? - Yes.

00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:21.175
(They look relaxed like a real couple.)

00:38:21.515 --> 00:38:23.345
I should be the one to do things like this.

00:38:26.615 --> 00:38:28.255
What did you do earlier in the afternoon?

00:38:29.615 --> 00:38:30.655
- In the afternoon? - Yes.

00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:34.085
I went on a date like you did.

00:38:36.995 --> 00:38:39.694
(So Hyun finds out about Sang Hyeon's Day Date.)

00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:40.795
Did it go well?

00:38:41.795 --> 00:38:42.895
Did it go well?

00:38:43.135 --> 00:38:44.811
- Yes, it went well. - Did you enjoy the date?

00:38:44.835 --> 00:38:47.265
- Did you enjoy it? - It cleared my head.

00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:49.674
It cleared his head?

00:38:49.675 --> 00:38:51.435
(Nodding)

00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:55.845
Which of the dates did you like the most?

00:38:56.245 --> 00:38:57.415
Me?

00:38:59.515 --> 00:39:00.614
A date?

00:39:00.615 --> 00:39:02.554
(She looks back on the dates she went on.)

00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:03.885
The princess date.

00:39:05.825 --> 00:39:07.725
You were with five men like a princess.

00:39:09.025 --> 00:39:10.054
The whole chicken soup date.

00:39:10.055 --> 00:39:13.225
(The 5-on-1 date was unforgettable for So Hyun.)

00:39:13.595 --> 00:39:15.495
(I'm a queen.)

00:39:16.435 --> 00:39:18.304
What other dates did I have?

00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:19.605
(What other dates did I have?)

00:39:20.905 --> 00:39:22.785
- What else... - You went to an amusement park.

00:39:23.635 --> 00:39:26.044
- At the amusement park... - Except for that date.

00:39:26.045 --> 00:39:28.074
Because that's the only date I can think of.

00:39:28.075 --> 00:39:30.614
- Right. - It was really memorable.

00:39:30.615 --> 00:39:32.785
I tried to think of the other dates...

00:39:33.315 --> 00:39:35.614
in order to choose the best one among all the dates I went on.

00:39:35.615 --> 00:39:36.884
(Even after looking back on all of the dates she had...)

00:39:36.885 --> 00:39:38.524
The date at the amusement park was really fun.

00:39:38.525 --> 00:39:40.625
- Of course. - I see.

00:39:42.355 --> 00:39:45.194
I hadn't seen you that excited before then.

00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:46.924
"Oh, yes! I'm at the amusement park!"

00:39:46.925 --> 00:39:47.925
(She found another side of Sang Hyeon that day.)

00:39:47.926 --> 00:39:51.194
- Watching you getting so excited, - I'm not immune to that.

00:39:51.195 --> 00:39:53.765
I found you very cute.

00:39:55.875 --> 00:39:57.904
I found a new side of you, which was charming.

00:39:57.905 --> 00:40:01.675
(She found an unexpected charm of Sang Hyeon.)

00:40:03.075 --> 00:40:05.545
To me, an amusement park...

00:40:06.085 --> 00:40:09.555
always meant a place for lovers.

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:14.995
I always went to an amusement park with someone special.

00:40:16.495 --> 00:40:18.195
From my perspective...

00:40:20.295 --> 00:40:21.325
It was nice.

00:40:21.425 --> 00:40:24.865
You were someone special for me.

00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:26.805
That's how I felt.

00:40:28.165 --> 00:40:30.335
So it felt like a date that real couples would have.

00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:32.245
He's being proactive.

00:40:32.505 --> 00:40:34.175
That day, you were...

00:40:36.115 --> 00:40:38.985
so beautiful. I mean it.

00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:41.515
Was she beautiful?

00:40:42.355 --> 00:40:44.515
In the afternoon, he told Bon Hee that she was pretty.

00:40:45.185 --> 00:40:46.584
(Bon Hee and Sang Hyeon's Day Date)

00:40:46.585 --> 00:40:49.385
(As you were walking toward me... You weren't wearing a dress, but...)

00:40:50.295 --> 00:40:52.565
(You look very pretty.)

00:40:53.265 --> 00:40:55.195
When Sang Hyeon was with Bon Hee...

00:40:55.295 --> 00:40:56.335
He said she looked pretty.

00:40:57.295 --> 00:41:00.605
Sang Hyeon seemed a little bit nervous.

00:41:01.135 --> 00:41:02.735
But with So Hyun,

00:41:03.275 --> 00:41:06.204
he seems a lot more relaxed.

00:41:06.205 --> 00:41:07.674
Really? I think it's the other way around.

00:41:07.675 --> 00:41:09.415
- Do you? - He seems uncomfortable.

00:41:09.675 --> 00:41:12.214
It seems that he tries to choose words...

00:41:12.215 --> 00:41:13.814
- Not using his familiar words... - Right.

00:41:13.815 --> 00:41:16.054
- He chooses words very carefully... - He sugar-coats his words?

00:41:16.055 --> 00:41:17.154
No, I don't mean he sugar-coats his words.

00:41:17.155 --> 00:41:19.955
It just feels like he chooses his words more carefully.

00:41:20.485 --> 00:41:24.124
He seemed more relaxed when he was with Bon Hee.

00:41:24.125 --> 00:41:25.164
Right.

00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:28.364
With So Hyun, he seems awkward and nervous,

00:41:28.365 --> 00:41:30.094
trying to choose words carefully.

00:41:30.095 --> 00:41:32.734
- Right. "Beautiful" was too much. - I see. I understand.

00:41:32.735 --> 00:41:35.134
- Have you ever used that word? - "Beautiful?"

00:41:35.135 --> 00:41:37.675
People usually use that word to describe a mountain or a river.

00:41:37.775 --> 00:41:39.144
We mostly use that word...

00:41:39.145 --> 00:41:41.204
- while enjoying a natural scenery. - Exactly.

00:41:41.205 --> 00:41:42.814
- It's different. - But Sang Hyeon...

00:41:42.815 --> 00:41:44.674
has his own way to describe things.

00:41:44.675 --> 00:41:46.275
(Sang Hyeon's words are very sensitive.)

00:41:46.315 --> 00:41:49.055
I really enjoyed it too. It's the most memorable date...

00:41:49.915 --> 00:41:53.525
Maybe it's because I was sad that it ended so quickly,

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:55.495
it was the most memorable date.

00:41:55.595 --> 00:41:56.595
I see.

00:41:56.825 --> 00:41:59.025
I'm still sad that I couldn't go to the zoo.

00:41:59.695 --> 00:42:02.464
When you go to the zoo,

00:42:02.465 --> 00:42:04.865
you can feed some animals.

00:42:05.835 --> 00:42:07.434
I love animals.

00:42:07.435 --> 00:42:09.535
Why do you like animals?

00:42:10.605 --> 00:42:11.745
They're harmless.

00:42:13.245 --> 00:42:16.744
They're harmless to me.

00:42:16.745 --> 00:42:18.615
That's what I like the most about animals.

00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:21.785
I found you...

00:42:22.755 --> 00:42:24.554
very charming...

00:42:24.555 --> 00:42:26.855
because you seemed so meek and kind.

00:42:28.355 --> 00:42:30.475
You seemed like a person who always yields to others.

00:42:30.925 --> 00:42:32.524
- That's true. - Things like that...

00:42:32.525 --> 00:42:36.764
Those are the personality traits that I like in a man,

00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:38.865
which I think is why I was attracted to you.

00:42:39.635 --> 00:42:41.205
You're different from me.

00:42:44.905 --> 00:42:46.404
You do know that...

00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:48.744
you and I are different types of people.

00:42:48.745 --> 00:42:51.574
If I'm being honest and dare to judge,

00:42:51.575 --> 00:42:53.715
I think you have a distinctive personality.

00:42:54.045 --> 00:42:57.085
- You're lively and bubbly. - I see.

00:42:57.185 --> 00:42:58.655
And I didn't...

00:43:00.525 --> 00:43:02.025
dislike that about you.

00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:03.394
I became curious about you.

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:06.065
To be honest, at some point,

00:43:06.565 --> 00:43:07.965
I wanted...

00:43:09.765 --> 00:43:11.564
to hang out more with you.

00:43:11.565 --> 00:43:15.375
Honestly, I'm curious about your world.

00:43:19.045 --> 00:43:20.675
He's trying so hard to say nice things.

00:43:21.145 --> 00:43:23.215
- Like "beautiful." - Right.

00:43:23.315 --> 00:43:25.515
- "I'm curious about your world." - "The world of you."

00:43:25.545 --> 00:43:27.784
- "Harmless." - "I'm a romantic guy."

00:43:27.785 --> 00:43:30.115
- "Animals are harmless." - "Animals are harmless."

00:43:30.555 --> 00:43:31.885
"Animals are harmless."

00:43:32.255 --> 00:43:34.585
Try going into a lion's cage and see if it's harmless.

00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:36.555
You'll be just gone.

00:43:37.695 --> 00:43:39.465
Tomorrow is the last day.

00:43:42.695 --> 00:43:44.035
(Sighing)

00:43:44.695 --> 00:43:46.165
Why do you keep sighing?

00:43:46.805 --> 00:43:48.505
On this show,

00:43:51.235 --> 00:43:55.114
I met such charming people.

00:43:55.115 --> 00:43:56.115
Yes.

00:43:58.045 --> 00:43:59.114
There's a person I'm attracted to...

00:43:59.115 --> 00:44:00.314
because she's different from me.

00:44:00.315 --> 00:44:01.884
And there's another one I'm attracted to...

00:44:01.885 --> 00:44:03.815
because she's similar to me.

00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:07.885
He's referring to specific people, isn't he?

00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:13.294
That's exactly how I feel.

00:44:13.295 --> 00:44:16.334
I see. You experienced those feelings at the same time?

00:44:16.335 --> 00:44:19.305
Yes, since I was experiencing them at the same time,

00:44:19.765 --> 00:44:22.504
it gave me such a headache from time to time.

00:44:22.505 --> 00:44:24.975
- I see. - It gave me such a headache.

00:44:26.405 --> 00:44:28.375
- It's a rare experience. - So you contemplated.

00:44:28.915 --> 00:44:31.445
- Yes. - You contemplated deeply.

00:44:32.485 --> 00:44:33.485
I see.

00:44:33.486 --> 00:44:34.985
She seems taken aback.

00:44:36.315 --> 00:44:39.284
(So Hyun finds out that Sang Hyeon is faltering.)

00:44:39.285 --> 00:44:40.385
It happened that way.

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:41.685
I didn't know that.

00:44:42.125 --> 00:44:43.355
- You didn't know? - No.

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:46.965
I decided to do as I want.

00:44:47.065 --> 00:44:50.734
We have to make a choice eventually.

00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:54.264
So I decided to do as I want.

00:44:54.265 --> 00:44:56.434
I'll follow my heart.

00:44:56.435 --> 00:44:57.935
That's the only thing on my mind.

00:45:04.645 --> 00:45:05.684
There's a little tension in the air.

00:45:05.685 --> 00:45:07.415
- It's lukewarm. - Right.

00:45:08.015 --> 00:45:09.655
I had no idea.

00:45:09.755 --> 00:45:13.555
Based on what he told me and how he treated me,

00:45:13.655 --> 00:45:17.025
I was sure that he had feelings for me.

00:45:17.795 --> 00:45:19.925
I thought he adored me.

00:45:20.865 --> 00:45:25.605
(You're so pretty.)

00:45:26.035 --> 00:45:28.674
(What is this?)

00:45:28.675 --> 00:45:30.704
(I want to give you a health supplement.)

00:45:30.705 --> 00:45:33.044
Really? Thank you.

00:45:33.045 --> 00:45:34.545
I really needed this.

00:45:35.445 --> 00:45:38.115
I thought he felt the same way about me as I felt about him,

00:45:38.445 --> 00:45:40.285
but maybe I was wrong.

00:45:42.085 --> 00:45:44.315
I was so confused.

00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:49.995
It's always so hard...

00:45:50.095 --> 00:45:52.094
to tell how someone feels.

00:45:52.095 --> 00:45:55.095
(It's always so hard to tell how someone feels.)

00:45:58.065 --> 00:46:00.605
If we do as our hearts say,

00:46:04.775 --> 00:46:06.175
things will go as we want, I think.

00:46:08.915 --> 00:46:10.914
(Nothing can be guaranteed after the last dates.)

00:46:10.915 --> 00:46:12.145
How will things pan out?

00:46:13.985 --> 00:46:17.785
My goodness. "Let's do as our hearts say."

00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:20.585
What he said would hurt my feelings if I were her.

00:46:20.685 --> 00:46:22.854
On many dates,

00:46:22.855 --> 00:46:25.395
we heard the participants say, "Let's do as our hearts say."

00:46:25.495 --> 00:46:28.425
But when Mu Jin and Bon Hee said it...

00:46:28.735 --> 00:46:31.271
Since they felt a certain level of certainty in their relationship,

00:46:31.295 --> 00:46:33.804
when they said it, it sounded like,

00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.674
"Don't feel pressured and follow your heart."

00:46:35.675 --> 00:46:37.275
That's how I interpreted their comments.

00:46:37.475 --> 00:46:39.944
But when Sang Hyeon said the same thing...

00:46:39.945 --> 00:46:41.874
He said he was contemplating deeply...

00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:44.244
between two people...

00:46:44.245 --> 00:46:45.815
before making the comment.

00:46:46.015 --> 00:46:49.355
So it was the same comment, but it sounded different.

00:46:49.885 --> 00:46:53.354
"Don't hate me too much because of my decision."

00:46:53.355 --> 00:46:54.355
- That's how it sounded to me. - Right.

00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:55.355
"Don't expect too much."

00:46:55.356 --> 00:46:56.624
- "Don't be disappointed." - Exactly.

00:46:56.625 --> 00:46:57.625
"I don't know whom I'll choose."

00:46:57.626 --> 00:46:58.664
- Right. It's the same comment, - "Let's do..."

00:46:58.665 --> 00:46:59.764
- as our hearts say." - but it sounded different.

00:46:59.765 --> 00:47:02.065
- Right. - If I were So Hyun,

00:47:02.165 --> 00:47:04.935
I'd think there's not enough time to make the decision...

00:47:05.735 --> 00:47:07.405
I'd be very upset.

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:10.934
Knowing Sang Hyeon, and as it happens repeatedly,

00:47:10.935 --> 00:47:12.044
I'm sure he'll regret again.

00:47:12.045 --> 00:47:13.204
My point, exactly.

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:14.844
- Is it like Sang Hyeon's habit? - I think he'll regret saying it.

00:47:14.845 --> 00:47:16.144
Is it his own way of speaking?

00:47:16.145 --> 00:47:17.444
I think he'll regret when he goes back to Yeon House.

00:47:17.445 --> 00:47:18.815
"Maybe I shouldn't have said it."

00:47:20.415 --> 00:47:23.315
(The Day and Night Dates ended where different emotions were felt.)

00:47:23.815 --> 00:47:27.585
(Mu Jin is at Yeon House as his date ended earlier than the others.)

00:47:27.825 --> 00:47:29.755
- Hey. You're back. - I just got back.

00:47:30.455 --> 00:47:32.325
- Did you enjoy your date? - Yes, I'm so full.

00:47:33.565 --> 00:47:34.625
Gosh, I'm so full.

00:47:35.125 --> 00:47:37.134
I didn't eat much food.

00:47:37.135 --> 00:47:38.165
Did you drink a lot?

00:47:38.395 --> 00:47:40.105
I had two glasses of cocktail.

00:47:41.165 --> 00:47:42.705
We were always busy eating food.

00:47:44.735 --> 00:47:47.175
But today, we...

00:47:48.075 --> 00:47:50.175
- talked more than we used to. - Did you talk a lot?

00:47:51.075 --> 00:47:52.684
Do you two have a different type of conversation now?

00:47:52.685 --> 00:47:54.715
- Yes. - A more stable conversation?

00:47:55.185 --> 00:47:57.955
Now we share our innermost feelings.

00:47:58.055 --> 00:48:01.825
Now that we know each other's age...

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:03.895
So you can talk about the future?

00:48:04.625 --> 00:48:06.665
- Yes. - That's cool.

00:48:08.125 --> 00:48:09.494
(Sighing)

00:48:09.495 --> 00:48:11.035
It's difficult.

00:48:12.965 --> 00:48:14.004
You seem tired.

00:48:14.005 --> 00:48:16.675
- Right. I look unwell, right? - Yes.

00:48:16.775 --> 00:48:19.444
Would you like to rest for a bit before you come down?

00:48:19.445 --> 00:48:21.604
I feel out of energy too.

00:48:21.605 --> 00:48:23.015
Why? What's up with you?

00:48:23.115 --> 00:48:24.874
It's not that I'm upset about anything.

00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:26.844
- You must be emotionally tired. - I mean...

00:48:26.845 --> 00:48:29.385
I started to worry again about real life issues.

00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:34.724
(Meanwhile, Ye Eun is still alone in her room.)

00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:35.824
- I feel bad for Ye Eun. - Poor her.

00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:37.355
Poor Ye Eun.

00:48:39.925 --> 00:48:41.295
I'm back.

00:48:41.865 --> 00:48:43.565
Welcome back.

00:48:45.405 --> 00:48:48.035
- Did you have a good day? - Yes.

00:48:49.575 --> 00:48:51.135
Did you have dinner?

00:48:52.575 --> 00:48:54.905
- Sorry? - You haven't had dinner yet, right?

00:48:55.105 --> 00:48:57.345
- I'm good. - Okay.

00:48:58.145 --> 00:48:59.985
What did you do on your dates?

00:49:00.715 --> 00:49:04.415
I just ate food at a restaurant. That was all.

00:49:04.715 --> 00:49:05.725
What did you eat?

00:49:06.255 --> 00:49:08.155
It was a Western cuisine restaurant.

00:49:08.255 --> 00:49:10.655
Who chose it?

00:49:10.795 --> 00:49:12.325
Hyeon Jun.

00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:16.495
I guess it's the guys who had to pick a date spot.

00:49:16.695 --> 00:49:17.734
I think so.

00:49:17.735 --> 00:49:20.135
I met Ji Yung as well.

00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:22.275
Was he really?

00:49:22.905 --> 00:49:24.374
- So... - Was it a three-person date?

00:49:24.375 --> 00:49:25.875
No, I went on two dates.

00:49:27.075 --> 00:49:28.205
That's cool.

00:49:28.815 --> 00:49:32.344
Ye Eun only just found out that the younger men...

00:49:32.345 --> 00:49:33.914
- each had two choices. - She only just found out.

00:49:33.915 --> 00:49:35.435
- She only just found out. - Goodness.

00:49:36.655 --> 00:49:38.985
- So it was... - When did they make the choices?

00:49:40.025 --> 00:49:42.395
- I didn't ask about that. - Everything bothers her now.

00:49:42.555 --> 00:49:44.024
Can you ask them for me?

00:49:44.025 --> 00:49:45.785
Whether it was last night or this morning...

00:49:45.895 --> 00:49:48.964
is going to be important for me.

00:49:48.965 --> 00:49:50.094
- Goodness. - Yesterday,

00:49:50.095 --> 00:49:52.365
I talked to him honestly.

00:49:52.935 --> 00:49:56.334
I told him he should follow his heart.

00:49:56.335 --> 00:50:00.074
Then, as he was leaving, he held my hand.

00:50:00.075 --> 00:50:01.604
- Right. - Goodness.

00:50:01.605 --> 00:50:04.244
We locked eyes and held hands tightly.

00:50:04.245 --> 00:50:07.215
To me, that was a good signal.

00:50:07.585 --> 00:50:09.785
He didn't just hold her hand. He held it tightly.

00:50:10.115 --> 00:50:15.055
(Last night, Sang Won requested her to have a conversation.)

00:50:15.155 --> 00:50:18.125
(Go to the person you are more drawn to.)

00:50:18.455 --> 00:50:20.225
(After the heartfelt conversation, )

00:50:20.325 --> 00:50:23.034
(Sang Won shook Ye Eun's hand, )

00:50:23.035 --> 00:50:26.405
(and Ye Eun considered it as a signal.)

00:50:27.135 --> 00:50:29.574
But to do this after giving me...

00:50:29.575 --> 00:50:31.205
a signal like that is...

00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:36.474
Honestly, it really hurts... It hurts my feelings a lot.

00:50:36.475 --> 00:50:37.745
Right.

00:50:38.045 --> 00:50:39.485
I understand.

00:50:40.915 --> 00:50:42.955
It's important to me.

00:50:43.455 --> 00:50:44.685
Right.

00:50:45.355 --> 00:50:46.454
But...

00:50:46.455 --> 00:50:48.755
- I'm worried about this. - Yes?

00:50:49.055 --> 00:50:50.595
Do you think we will gather up later?

00:50:50.995 --> 00:50:53.695
I think we might, even if it's late.

00:50:54.625 --> 00:50:55.735
Why do you ask?

00:50:57.965 --> 00:51:01.035
I'm a very honest person.

00:51:04.275 --> 00:51:07.475
So it all shows up on my face.

00:51:07.705 --> 00:51:08.805
Right.

00:51:09.445 --> 00:51:11.525
You're worried that it would show up on your face...

00:51:12.115 --> 00:51:13.945
when everyone is there.

00:51:18.485 --> 00:51:21.485
I hope she won't come to me.

00:51:23.225 --> 00:51:24.425
Ji Won.

00:51:26.725 --> 00:51:27.794
(Oh, dear.)

00:51:27.795 --> 00:51:29.355
She doesn't want Ji Won to come to her.

00:51:31.735 --> 00:51:34.534
She assumes that Ji Won...

00:51:34.535 --> 00:51:36.095
must have gone on a date with Sang Won.

00:51:36.235 --> 00:51:37.805
Oh, dear.

00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:43.715
I hope she won't come to me.

00:51:45.445 --> 00:51:46.584
Ji Won.

00:51:46.585 --> 00:51:49.015
(She hopes Ji Won won't come to her.)

00:51:49.715 --> 00:51:51.384
I hope she won't come to me, with that whining voice.

00:51:51.385 --> 00:51:52.824
(She doesn't think she can face Ji Won like nothing happened.)

00:51:52.825 --> 00:51:55.595
- I hope she won't do that. - I will close the door.

00:51:58.455 --> 00:52:02.395
It must be uncomfortable for you to look at Ji Won.

00:52:02.895 --> 00:52:06.564
It's not that I don't like her.

00:52:06.565 --> 00:52:08.065
- I know. - But...

00:52:08.865 --> 00:52:10.404
I'm hurt badly.

00:52:10.405 --> 00:52:13.675
(But I'm hurt badly.)

00:52:16.175 --> 00:52:18.045
How can I pretend to be fine?

00:52:18.675 --> 00:52:21.245
You can cry if you feel like it.

00:52:21.815 --> 00:52:23.714
I can understand why she would think that.

00:52:23.715 --> 00:52:25.215
How will she pretend to be fine?

00:52:27.585 --> 00:52:28.884
(She understands it with her head, )

00:52:28.885 --> 00:52:30.254
It's okay.

00:52:30.255 --> 00:52:34.065
(but her heart is still in pain.)

00:52:37.895 --> 00:52:40.405
What should I do, Yeong Gyeong?

00:52:42.935 --> 00:52:44.935
I will go and ask when he asked her out on a date.

00:52:47.445 --> 00:52:48.774
If I were Ye Eun,

00:52:48.775 --> 00:52:49.914
- I would go mad. - Me too.

00:52:49.915 --> 00:52:51.815
- You can't just leave the house. - Right.

00:52:52.385 --> 00:52:54.585
And you can't just stay in the room alone.

00:52:55.815 --> 00:52:58.115
- That would be too tough. - That would be too tough.

00:52:58.585 --> 00:53:00.824
She must be embarrassed, hurt,

00:53:00.825 --> 00:53:02.055
and irritated.

00:53:02.625 --> 00:53:04.755
- You are all here. - Yes.

00:53:05.225 --> 00:53:06.294
- What did you do? - When did you get back?

00:53:06.295 --> 00:53:07.325
- I was starving. - Oh?

00:53:07.465 --> 00:53:08.964
- Can I talk to you? - Oh.

00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:10.664
- I need to talk to you. - Me?

00:53:10.665 --> 00:53:11.734
Great.

00:53:11.735 --> 00:53:13.204
(They have no clue about Ye Eun's situation.)

00:53:13.205 --> 00:53:14.841
- Yeong Gyeong's changed. - It's my first time seeing this.

00:53:14.865 --> 00:53:16.034
Is it your first time seeing me like this?

00:53:16.035 --> 00:53:17.274
Since everyone is here,

00:53:17.275 --> 00:53:19.045
let's go upstairs.

00:53:20.045 --> 00:53:21.074
Cute.

00:53:21.075 --> 00:53:22.075
Okay.

00:53:23.015 --> 00:53:24.374
(Yeong Gyeong and Hyeon Jun came to the 2nd floor.)

00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:27.185
It's just that there's something I need to ask you.

00:53:28.115 --> 00:53:29.814
When did you choose...

00:53:29.815 --> 00:53:32.355
who you were going on today’s date with?

00:53:32.385 --> 00:53:33.854
- Today? - This morning.

00:53:33.855 --> 00:53:35.185
This morning. Right.

00:53:36.295 --> 00:53:39.095
There's a problem we need to solve.

00:53:39.765 --> 00:53:41.264
Ye Eun's been here alone...

00:53:41.265 --> 00:53:43.735
all day long.

00:53:44.235 --> 00:53:48.065
She must have felt hurt staying here alone all day.

00:53:49.505 --> 00:53:51.905
It seems...

00:53:52.475 --> 00:53:55.745
she had a heart-to-heart with Sang Won last night.

00:53:56.675 --> 00:53:58.675
She thought their conversation went well.

00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:01.561
And she even thought he gave her a signal.

00:54:01.585 --> 00:54:05.554
But he didn't ask her out on a date today.

00:54:05.555 --> 00:54:07.284
So that made her feel...

00:54:07.285 --> 00:54:09.994
- She must've been hurt. - She had her hopes high...

00:54:09.995 --> 00:54:12.595
only to be disappointed.

00:54:13.095 --> 00:54:16.035
Now she's embarrassed to come down.

00:54:16.935 --> 00:54:18.194
What do we do?

00:54:18.195 --> 00:54:20.304
I will figure something out.

00:54:20.305 --> 00:54:21.405
- Okay. - Okay.

00:54:23.035 --> 00:54:24.875
- Come, Sang Won. - Yes?

00:54:25.705 --> 00:54:26.904
It's raining a lot.

00:54:26.905 --> 00:54:28.174
(Hyeon Jun talks to Sang Won right away.)

00:54:28.175 --> 00:54:31.474
It seems Ye Eun didn't get to go out today.

00:54:31.475 --> 00:54:33.284
She must've been home all day, all by herself.

00:54:33.285 --> 00:54:36.855
And it hurt her feelings.

00:54:37.385 --> 00:54:40.825
Ye Eun feels that you hurt her feelings.

00:54:42.385 --> 00:54:44.524
She's also curious about whether you made your choice...

00:54:44.525 --> 00:54:48.094
last night or this morning.

00:54:48.095 --> 00:54:50.865
It seems she wants to talk to you.

00:54:54.235 --> 00:54:57.805
I think you should talk to her now so we can all eat together.

00:54:58.135 --> 00:55:00.274
They can't talk alone when everyone is around.

00:55:00.275 --> 00:55:02.405
It would be nice if they talk alone first.

00:55:08.745 --> 00:55:10.084
(Knock-knock)

00:55:10.085 --> 00:55:11.085
Yes?

00:55:12.818 --> 00:55:14.087
(Knock-knock)

00:55:14.088 --> 00:55:15.118
Yes?

00:55:15.218 --> 00:55:17.158
- Is Ye Eun in? - She is.

00:55:17.388 --> 00:55:18.888
Can you ask her to come out?

00:55:19.388 --> 00:55:20.458
Okay.

00:55:20.658 --> 00:55:23.098
- I will be there on the sofa. - Okay.

00:55:28.338 --> 00:55:29.937
(Sang Won waits for Ye Eun.)

00:55:29.938 --> 00:55:31.737
It must be difficult for Sang Won.

00:55:31.738 --> 00:55:34.038
(Sang Won waits for Ye Eun.)

00:55:50.188 --> 00:55:52.828
Sit. I will tell you.

00:55:55.198 --> 00:55:57.727
I had my reasons. Sit.

00:55:57.728 --> 00:56:00.328
(Sang Won had his reasons.)

00:56:02.138 --> 00:56:03.798
I heard you were not happy.

00:56:07.568 --> 00:56:08.938
Here's what happened.

00:56:10.808 --> 00:56:13.408
There was a day date, and there was a night date.

00:56:14.048 --> 00:56:16.918
The night date was like a real date.

00:56:17.578 --> 00:56:20.818
The day date for me was an opportunity to talk.

00:56:21.218 --> 00:56:24.587
That's why I chose someone who I had never got to talk to,

00:56:24.588 --> 00:56:26.588
someone who I was a little interested in at first.

00:56:27.588 --> 00:56:30.827
That was So Hyun. I wanted to use the chance...

00:56:30.828 --> 00:56:32.567
to go to a cafe with her and have a chat.

00:56:32.568 --> 00:56:33.797
How about the night date then?

00:56:33.798 --> 00:56:35.667
I talked to Ji Won then.

00:56:35.668 --> 00:56:37.667
(I see.)

00:56:37.668 --> 00:56:40.708
On the night date, we could be more relaxed.

00:56:41.938 --> 00:56:44.877
There was no date after, so I thought we could talk...

00:56:44.878 --> 00:56:46.448
more freely then, so I chose Ji Won.

00:56:47.148 --> 00:56:49.248
At the end of the day, you didn't choose me.

00:56:51.288 --> 00:56:53.818
In the end, I didn't choose you.

00:56:54.118 --> 00:56:55.258
Right.

00:56:56.358 --> 00:56:57.618
Because I've been always...

00:56:58.288 --> 00:57:02.458
clear about where I stand,

00:57:03.298 --> 00:57:07.128
even when I talked to other men,

00:57:07.668 --> 00:57:09.698
I only talked about you.

00:57:10.298 --> 00:57:13.508
I guess it's because I am clear about...

00:57:14.138 --> 00:57:15.938
who I am drawn to.

00:57:17.848 --> 00:57:19.048
To be honest,

00:57:20.048 --> 00:57:21.448
seeing how you...

00:57:22.518 --> 00:57:24.048
held my hand at the end,

00:57:25.718 --> 00:57:27.958
I thought you had...

00:57:28.618 --> 00:57:31.427
some feelings for me too.

00:57:31.428 --> 00:57:32.558
She can think that.

00:57:33.088 --> 00:57:36.028
Not being chosen for the date,

00:57:37.098 --> 00:57:39.028
I felt hurt.

00:57:40.898 --> 00:57:43.397
(On the day Sang Won bought wasabi for Ye Eun)

00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:45.938
(On the day Sang Won bought wasabi for Ye Eun)

00:57:46.468 --> 00:57:49.977
(I want to tell you how I feel.)

00:57:49.978 --> 00:57:53.048
(I went to the Korean dining restaurant with Mu Jin, you know.)

00:57:54.178 --> 00:57:56.918
(I couldn't stop thinking about you there.)

00:57:57.318 --> 00:57:59.617
(Yesterday, I told you that you were...)

00:57:59.618 --> 00:58:01.888
(one of the few people I'm interested in.)

00:58:01.988 --> 00:58:04.428
(They used to have mutual interest in each other.)

00:58:05.128 --> 00:58:08.127
(You completely won me over...)

00:58:08.128 --> 00:58:09.627
(by wasabi.)

00:58:09.628 --> 00:58:11.497
(It was one of the things...)

00:58:11.498 --> 00:58:15.167
(I had to buy at the grocery store.)

00:58:15.168 --> 00:58:18.468
(I thought I shouldn't forget about the meat and wasabi.)

00:58:19.268 --> 00:58:21.978
(But of course, I didn't just buy it for no reason.)

00:58:22.208 --> 00:58:26.508
(Ye Eun thought Sang Won felt the same way about her.)

00:58:28.518 --> 00:58:29.687
(But Sang Won didn't choose Ye Eun for the last date.)

00:58:29.688 --> 00:58:30.918
Oh, dear.

00:58:34.058 --> 00:58:35.198
- What will they do? - So...

00:58:35.398 --> 00:58:37.898
what is it that you want to say?

00:58:39.068 --> 00:58:41.028
I came to check.

00:58:41.868 --> 00:58:44.198
I heard you weren't so happy.

00:58:44.568 --> 00:58:47.008
I feel sorry that I am the cause.

00:58:47.268 --> 00:58:48.678
I didn't think things would...

00:58:50.508 --> 00:58:54.078
turn out this way.

00:59:00.048 --> 00:59:01.188
I see.

00:59:03.688 --> 00:59:04.718
Okay.

00:59:05.288 --> 00:59:07.158
Thank you for coming to talk to me.

00:59:10.698 --> 00:59:12.267
I spent my time alone well.

00:59:12.268 --> 00:59:13.328
I did ballet.

00:59:14.198 --> 00:59:15.298
I exercised.

00:59:18.098 --> 00:59:19.338
I worked on my assignments too.

00:59:19.638 --> 00:59:21.037
I finished writing my thesis too.

00:59:21.038 --> 00:59:23.577
(She bursts out in tears.)

00:59:23.578 --> 00:59:25.008
But... Gosh.

00:59:25.878 --> 00:59:27.408
I will go back to my room.

00:59:29.578 --> 00:59:30.578
I'm sorry.

00:59:32.918 --> 00:59:35.417
(Afraid that he might see her cry, Ye Eun hurriedly leaves.)

00:59:35.418 --> 00:59:37.888
(Afraid that he might see her cry, Ye Eun hurriedly leaves.)

00:59:44.428 --> 00:59:48.097
He's in an awkward situation, and she's really hurt.

00:59:48.098 --> 00:59:51.297
(Seeing Ye Eun hurt, he is perplexed.)

00:59:51.298 --> 00:59:54.408
(Seeing Ye Eun hurt, he is perplexed.)

00:59:59.008 --> 01:00:00.577
Perhaps because it's the last day,

01:00:00.578 --> 01:00:02.778
- everyone is in a low mood. - Yes.

01:00:03.218 --> 01:00:05.288
- We're sorry to leave. - There's that too.

01:00:05.688 --> 01:00:07.617
- Everyone's perplexed. - It's a bit of everything.

01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:08.687
(After talking to Ye Eun, Sang Won comes down to the 1st floor.)

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:09.958
It's raining too.

01:00:10.988 --> 01:00:12.088
What's up with that face?

01:00:13.028 --> 01:00:16.358
He's usually not a serious person.

01:00:17.758 --> 01:00:20.597
(Staring)

01:00:20.598 --> 01:00:23.438
(Staring)

01:00:23.698 --> 01:00:25.367
Why is this chair really heavy?

01:00:25.368 --> 01:00:28.477
(Sang Won's serious face dampens the atmosphere.)

01:00:28.478 --> 01:00:31.238
(Conscious)

01:00:36.018 --> 01:00:37.448
Is everyone home?

01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:41.087
I heard everyone is home. Where is Ye Eun?

01:00:41.088 --> 01:00:42.457
- She's home. - I see.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:43.588
- She's home. - Is she?

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:45.127
I will go talk to her.

01:00:45.128 --> 01:00:46.358
- Alone? - Yes.

01:00:47.628 --> 01:00:48.628
No.

01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:49.628
(Don't go.)

01:00:49.798 --> 01:00:50.798
- Oh, dear. - Don't go.

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:54.068
- No. - This is bad timing, Ji Won.

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:55.937
(Knocking)

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:57.738
She must be in a really bad mood.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.938
Is Ye Eun here?

01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:05.447
Go downstairs.

01:01:05.448 --> 01:01:07.107
(Yeong Gyeong sends her down.)

01:01:07.108 --> 01:01:09.247
The situation is really bad.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.077
- She should come back later. - Right.

01:01:11.078 --> 01:01:12.418
(Shutting the door)

01:01:15.158 --> 01:01:16.158
Where is Ye Eun?

01:01:22.928 --> 01:01:24.157
(Looking)

01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:25.628
(Asking to talk)

01:01:26.128 --> 01:01:28.898
(She quietly takes Bon Hee.)

01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:31.668
(Sighing)

01:01:32.908 --> 01:01:34.607
(The younger men figures out the situation.)

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:35.708
Look.

01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:39.978
I guess someone might not have gone on a date today.

01:01:41.308 --> 01:01:42.317
(Oh!)

01:01:42.318 --> 01:01:43.847
- Not once? - Right.

01:01:43.848 --> 01:01:45.948
It's possible that someone never went on a date.

01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:48.147
I thought there would be at least one date for everyone.

01:01:48.148 --> 01:01:49.857
(They realize there's someone who didn't get to go on any dates.)

01:01:49.858 --> 01:01:51.287
They didn't share it.

01:01:51.288 --> 01:01:52.758
- Right. - Who their dates were.

01:01:55.558 --> 01:01:59.497
(Ji Won takes Bon Hee to the stairs.)

01:01:59.498 --> 01:02:01.668
I went to Ye Eun's room,

01:02:02.838 --> 01:02:03.968
and I was told to leave.

01:02:05.968 --> 01:02:07.808
Ye Eun was in the restroom.

01:02:08.408 --> 01:02:11.407
And Yeong Gyeong told me to leave.

01:02:11.408 --> 01:02:13.178
She told me to go to the first floor.

01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:15.148
Why?

01:02:15.378 --> 01:02:16.548
I don't know.

01:02:16.648 --> 01:02:18.348
- Really? - Yes.

01:02:18.718 --> 01:02:21.247
When Sang Won came down, he looked really serious.

01:02:21.248 --> 01:02:22.288
Yes.

01:02:22.718 --> 01:02:24.617
I should go talk to Sang Won.

01:02:24.618 --> 01:02:26.158
- Yes. - Go ahead.

01:02:31.398 --> 01:02:33.497
- Can we talk? - Yes.

01:02:33.498 --> 01:02:36.968
(Ji Won asks Sang Won to talk.)

01:02:37.168 --> 01:02:39.268
- What's wrong? - What?

01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:41.108
Ye Eun?

01:02:41.238 --> 01:02:43.037
- I heard she was unhappy. - Yes.

01:02:43.038 --> 01:02:44.678
I should be more careful about saying it.

01:02:45.448 --> 01:02:48.208
I was worried about her, so I went upstairs to her room.

01:02:48.418 --> 01:02:51.418
- And I was told to go down. - Did she...

01:02:52.148 --> 01:02:53.547
So it made me wonder if I had done something...

01:02:53.548 --> 01:02:54.787
(So it made me wonder if I had done something...)

01:02:54.788 --> 01:02:56.588
It wasn't something you did.

01:02:56.688 --> 01:02:59.688
Everyone expected me to go on a date...

01:03:00.088 --> 01:03:01.528
with you.

01:03:02.228 --> 01:03:04.397
Even Ye Eun knew about it. I think she expected me...

01:03:04.398 --> 01:03:07.267
to ask her out to go on...

01:03:07.268 --> 01:03:08.368
the other date.

01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:12.038
I knew she might feel sad about it.

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:14.737
But I didn't think she would be staying home all day.

01:03:14.738 --> 01:03:16.778
- How could he have known? - He didn't expect that.

01:03:17.178 --> 01:03:21.478
(Ji Won learns that Ye Eun didn't get to go on any dates.)

01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:23.817
(Knock-knock)

01:03:23.818 --> 01:03:26.988
(Worried, Bon Hee goes to Ye Eun.)

01:03:30.058 --> 01:03:31.518
Can I come in?

01:03:32.528 --> 01:03:33.788
Ye Eun.

01:03:36.228 --> 01:03:37.758
What have you been doing?

01:03:40.898 --> 01:03:43.098
(Looking at her)

01:03:44.938 --> 01:03:46.207
(As soon as she sees Bon Hee, she bursts into tears.)

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:49.138
She's going to cry again.

01:03:50.238 --> 01:03:51.908
She just stopped.

01:03:52.808 --> 01:03:56.078
(Flustered)

01:04:02.018 --> 01:04:03.287
What happened?

01:04:03.288 --> 01:04:06.927
(She tries to suppress her feelings, but she can't contain her emotion.)

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:10.557
(She tries to suppress her feelings, but she can't contain her emotion.)

01:04:10.558 --> 01:04:11.868
It's okay.

01:04:15.198 --> 01:04:17.167
(Looking around)

01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:18.267
Did Bon Hee go up?

01:04:18.268 --> 01:04:20.468
(I don't know.)

01:04:21.438 --> 01:04:25.808
(Ji Won hesitates to go up.)

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:30.118
(Thinking about it)

01:04:31.048 --> 01:04:32.618
I will go up.

01:04:34.748 --> 01:04:37.757
(She carefully approaches Ye Eun's room.)

01:04:37.758 --> 01:04:40.057
- The door is open. - Yes.

01:04:40.058 --> 01:04:41.187
(Through the opened door, )

01:04:41.188 --> 01:04:45.927
(she can hear Ye Eun crying.)

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:47.867
- I'm okay. - Okay.

01:04:47.868 --> 01:04:51.908
(Ji Won gives up and leaves.)

01:04:53.308 --> 01:04:55.307
(She came into her room instead.)

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.438
She must feel bad too.

01:05:00.678 --> 01:05:02.818
(Sighing)

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:07.788
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

01:05:10.488 --> 01:05:15.158
I know that Ye Eun is interested in Sang Won.

01:05:17.428 --> 01:05:19.928
I had mixed emotions.

01:05:23.038 --> 01:05:27.068
(Ji Won can't stop being bothered.)

01:05:27.838 --> 01:05:29.937
Ye Eun knows that Ji Won isn't the one to blame.

01:05:29.938 --> 01:05:32.278
Ji Won knows everything that's going on,

01:05:32.608 --> 01:05:34.577
but there's nothing she can do about it.

01:05:34.578 --> 01:05:36.317
She was chosen.

01:05:36.318 --> 01:05:37.577
Sang Won chose...

01:05:37.578 --> 01:05:39.687
the person he wanted to go on a date with...

01:05:39.688 --> 01:05:42.587
- out of his free will. - Of course.

01:05:42.588 --> 01:05:45.017
- Of course. - There's no villain.

01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:46.687
And that makes it difficult for everyone.

01:05:46.688 --> 01:05:47.757
(Because nobody is at fault, everyone struggles.)

01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:49.898
What will they do? What's going to happen?

01:05:52.568 --> 01:05:55.197
(A message has arrived at Yeon House.)

01:05:55.198 --> 01:05:57.138
Do you think she's really sad?

01:05:57.968 --> 01:05:59.008
Did you receive something?

01:06:00.438 --> 01:06:01.608
I got one too.

01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:03.277
(It's time for the game Truth or Dare.)

01:06:03.278 --> 01:06:05.247
- To know each other's feelings. - Truth or Dare.

01:06:05.248 --> 01:06:06.577
- Truth or Dare! - Truth or Dare!

01:06:06.578 --> 01:06:08.547
They have to ask each other a question.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.748
And every question will remain anonymous.

01:06:11.848 --> 01:06:13.188
What should I ask?

01:06:14.318 --> 01:06:15.557
I don't know what to send.

01:06:15.558 --> 01:06:19.058
(They think hard about the question.)

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:22.098
Personally, I have a lot of questions now.

01:06:23.398 --> 01:06:25.467
In a way, it turned out for the better.

01:06:25.468 --> 01:06:27.727
I got a chance...

01:06:27.728 --> 01:06:30.038
to talk to him a little more.

01:06:31.138 --> 01:06:32.637
I want to ask him about what he's thinking...

01:06:32.638 --> 01:06:34.198
and the things I've been curious about.

01:06:34.268 --> 01:06:35.637
I wanted to ask her.

01:06:35.638 --> 01:06:37.958
(It's time to ask each other about their honest thoughts.)

01:06:38.178 --> 01:06:40.077
Since it remains anonymous, they can be completely...

01:06:40.078 --> 01:06:41.407
- honest. - Right.

01:06:41.408 --> 01:06:43.294
(Truth or Dare time comes to the rainy Yeon House.)

01:06:43.318 --> 01:06:44.747
- You're here. - Hello.

01:06:44.748 --> 01:06:45.888
Ye Eun came down.

01:06:46.088 --> 01:06:47.318
(Hesitating)

01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:50.558
(Looking)

01:06:51.418 --> 01:06:52.628
He's conscious of her.

01:06:57.898 --> 01:07:00.227
We shouldn't mix up the seating arrangement...

01:07:00.228 --> 01:07:01.228
- too obviously. - Right.

01:07:01.229 --> 01:07:03.109
(Sang Won and Ye Eun don't look at each other.)

01:07:03.138 --> 01:07:06.467
(So Hyun passes by Sang Hyeon.)

01:07:06.468 --> 01:07:10.478
(Bon Hee sits next to Mu Jin.)

01:07:17.218 --> 01:07:20.417
Ye Eun and Ji Won are facing each other now.

01:07:20.418 --> 01:07:21.647
Oh, dear.

01:07:21.648 --> 01:07:23.317
Ye Eun cried so much...

01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:24.557
that her face is all swollen.

01:07:24.558 --> 01:07:26.238
(Before the game, there's subtle tension.)

01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:28.898
Goodness, it's the last night.

01:07:28.928 --> 01:07:30.797
That's how they met on the first day.

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:32.827
And this is now their last night there.

01:07:32.828 --> 01:07:35.737
"Choose a person freely and ask each other a question."

01:07:35.738 --> 01:07:38.098
(Each person will choose a question and choose who to ask.)

01:07:40.068 --> 01:07:41.307
There are questions in that box,

01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:42.537
but they don't know who wrote that, right?

01:07:42.538 --> 01:07:43.984
(Sang Won is the first one to choose a question.)

01:07:44.008 --> 01:07:46.147
Are they supposed to just read the question...

01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:47.747
- and answer? - Yes.

01:07:47.748 --> 01:07:49.578
(He doesn’t know who sent the question.)

01:07:50.418 --> 01:07:55.218
(Who will Sang Won ask the question to?)

01:07:57.488 --> 01:07:58.488
Bon Hee.

01:07:59.928 --> 01:08:01.127
I shouldn't have locked eyes.

01:08:01.128 --> 01:08:02.628
(What's the question for Bon Hee?)

01:08:03.598 --> 01:08:05.498
"Between someone who has the same..."

01:08:05.598 --> 01:08:07.098
"or the opposite disposition as you,"

01:08:07.198 --> 01:08:08.738
"who are you more drawn to?"

01:08:09.298 --> 01:08:10.937
Oh, nice question.

01:08:10.938 --> 01:08:12.507
(Between someone who has the same or the opposite disposition as you, )

01:08:12.508 --> 01:08:13.967
(who are you more drawn to?)

01:08:13.968 --> 01:08:15.528
I think Sang Hyeon asked this question.

01:08:16.438 --> 01:08:18.338
- It sounds like Sang Hyeon, right? - Yes.

01:08:19.548 --> 01:08:22.117
(Bon Hee's answer is...)

01:08:22.118 --> 01:08:23.178
The same disposition.

01:08:24.478 --> 01:08:26.318
She said the same disposition.

01:08:26.718 --> 01:08:29.557
But we don't know who the person with the same disposition is.

01:08:29.558 --> 01:08:32.278
(Bon Hee is more drawn to someone with the same disposition as her.)

01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:38.158
(Yeong Gyeong chose a question.)

01:08:41.698 --> 01:08:44.637
So, I want to ask So Hyun.

01:08:44.638 --> 01:08:45.638
Yes?

01:08:45.768 --> 01:08:47.968
"Is there a moment you want to take back?"

01:08:48.508 --> 01:08:51.377
- Oh, a moment I want to take back? - Yes.

01:08:51.378 --> 01:08:53.607
(Is there a moment you want to take back?)

01:08:53.608 --> 01:08:55.448
A moment I want to take back...

01:08:56.918 --> 01:08:57.947
(So Hyun, who feels confused...)

01:08:57.948 --> 01:09:00.118
Who would've asked that kind of question?

01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:03.458
"A moment you want to take back." Is there a relationship...

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:05.527
that might make someone ask this kind of question?

01:09:05.528 --> 01:09:07.648
(Is there a moment that she might want to turn back?)

01:09:08.128 --> 01:09:09.897
(Curious)

01:09:09.898 --> 01:09:10.898
What will she say?

01:09:11.558 --> 01:09:12.718
Was there a moment like that?

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:13.898
No.

01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:17.398
In every moment, I think I just made choices...

01:09:18.038 --> 01:09:21.108
that my heart led me to.

01:09:21.868 --> 01:09:22.878
Yes.

01:09:23.938 --> 01:09:25.748
I don't have any moments I want to take back.

01:09:26.778 --> 01:09:28.918
Right, she always behaved the same way.

01:09:29.378 --> 01:09:31.018
And she behaved like a consistent person.

01:09:31.248 --> 01:09:35.187
I think my desire to choose Sang Hyeon...

01:09:35.188 --> 01:09:37.518
never changed and stayed the same the whole time.

01:09:39.358 --> 01:09:43.398
(So Hyun was attracted to Sang Hyeon from his first impression.)

01:09:44.128 --> 01:09:47.197
(After that, it has always been Sang Hyeon, )

01:09:47.198 --> 01:09:49.737
(and she expressed herself honestly.)

01:09:49.738 --> 01:09:52.268
(and she expressed herself honestly.)

01:09:53.208 --> 01:09:54.667
(So Hyun doesn't regret her decision.)

01:09:54.668 --> 01:09:58.007
So, for So Hyun, it has always been Sang Hyeon, right?

01:09:58.008 --> 01:09:59.808
(So Hyun doesn't regret her decision.)

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.947
(This time, Ji Won chose a question.)

01:10:04.948 --> 01:10:06.018
What is it?

01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:08.718
Gosh, this is hard.

01:10:09.418 --> 01:10:11.518
- Is it Ye Eun's question? - No way.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.557
Sang Hyeon.

01:10:13.558 --> 01:10:16.328
(Ji Won chose to ask Sang Hyeon.)

01:10:17.128 --> 01:10:19.397
- The question must be hard. - I guess so.

01:10:19.398 --> 01:10:23.397
"Did you change your mind after today's date?"

01:10:23.398 --> 01:10:25.167
(Did you change your mind after today's date?)

01:10:25.168 --> 01:10:26.308
Did I change my mind?

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:32.948
I clearly knew from today's conversation.

01:10:33.748 --> 01:10:36.517
From what I felt, the person with similar vibes as me...

01:10:36.518 --> 01:10:37.678
was Bon Hee.

01:10:38.478 --> 01:10:41.348
And the one who's the complete opposite with bubbly personality...

01:10:41.448 --> 01:10:42.717
was So Hyun.

01:10:42.718 --> 01:10:44.558
(So Hyun has a different disposition from me.)

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:49.857
(After going on dates with two contrasting people, )

01:10:49.858 --> 01:10:52.367
(have you changed your mind?)

01:10:52.368 --> 01:10:53.898
What is it? What will he say?

01:10:53.998 --> 01:10:55.028
- Yes. - What?

01:10:57.298 --> 01:10:58.537
He changed his mind?

01:10:58.538 --> 01:11:03.208
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

01:11:03.378 --> 01:11:04.378
But look.

01:11:04.379 --> 01:11:06.224
No one knows where his heart was before and after.

01:11:06.248 --> 01:11:08.507
Since he expressed his attraction to both,

01:11:08.508 --> 01:11:09.717
there's no way for us to know.

01:11:09.718 --> 01:11:11.478
(So curious)

01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:13.488
Yes.

01:11:15.318 --> 01:11:18.057
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

01:11:18.058 --> 01:11:20.828
(After today's date, Sang Hyeon's mind has changed.)

01:11:21.958 --> 01:11:23.334
Why does Mu Jin look so taken aback?

01:11:23.358 --> 01:11:24.358
- Of course, he would be. - Right.

01:11:24.359 --> 01:11:26.199
He doesn't know who he chose before and after.

01:11:31.868 --> 01:11:35.238
From the actions and words that he showed me,

01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:38.638
I thought his heart was pointing in my direction.

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:41.947
But when he said that he had changed his mind...

01:11:41.948 --> 01:11:44.668
- She thinks it might not be her. - "Did he really change his mind?"

01:11:45.648 --> 01:11:47.017
"Did he have a change of heart?"

01:11:47.018 --> 01:11:48.818
After going on a date with someone else...

01:11:50.688 --> 01:11:53.228
The date with Bon Hee left...

01:11:54.358 --> 01:11:56.498
a deeper impression than I thought.

01:11:57.128 --> 01:11:58.428
That was actually...

01:11:59.128 --> 01:12:02.598
what made me really go back and forth.

01:12:03.238 --> 01:12:04.937
What choice will I make?

01:12:04.938 --> 01:12:07.607
I honestly don't really know either.

01:12:07.608 --> 01:12:08.708
Oh, what is this?

01:12:10.138 --> 01:12:12.898
(Sang Hyeon's heart is wavering the night before the final decision.)

01:12:13.278 --> 01:12:16.978
(On the last night at Yeon House, the end is a mystery.)

01:12:17.948 --> 01:12:18.948
(Ji Yung is the last one to ask a question.)

01:12:18.949 --> 01:12:23.188
I want to ask this question to everyone.

01:12:24.118 --> 01:12:25.758
"On the last day,"

01:12:25.858 --> 01:12:28.828
- "was coming here a good choice?" - Was it a good choice?

01:12:29.228 --> 01:12:30.228
That's a good question.

01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:31.228
"Do you have any regrets?"

01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:32.667
(A question for everyone)

01:12:32.668 --> 01:12:34.097
(Was coming here a good choice? Do you have any regrets?)

01:12:34.098 --> 01:12:35.168
Regrets?

01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:37.598
- I'm curious about Ye Eun. - Regrets?

01:12:39.068 --> 01:12:40.838
First of all, I think...

01:12:46.048 --> 01:12:48.108
I definitely don't have any regrets.

01:12:48.578 --> 01:12:50.548
I rather think it was good for me to come.

01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:53.848
It was so nice to be here. Really.

01:12:55.618 --> 01:12:58.617
Out of all of the decisions I've made this year,

01:12:58.618 --> 01:13:02.158
I think this was the best decision.

01:13:02.258 --> 01:13:04.457
- I'm glad to hear that. - So, I have zero regrets.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.827
Gosh, I'm so glad.

01:13:05.828 --> 01:13:08.928
I didn't know I'd become so invested in this.

01:13:10.798 --> 01:13:11.868
It was nice.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:14.438
Yes, it was nice.

01:13:15.568 --> 01:13:17.377
I think I felt many emotions...

01:13:17.378 --> 01:13:18.638
that I normally don't feel.

01:13:18.738 --> 01:13:20.408
Just person to person,

01:13:21.308 --> 01:13:23.248
I'm leaving this place with lots of stimulation.

01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:24.818
"Person to person."

01:13:24.918 --> 01:13:28.788
I took the time to think about a lot today.

01:13:29.358 --> 01:13:32.627
I'm someone who takes responsibility for my decisions,

01:13:32.628 --> 01:13:34.927
- so I don't have any regrets. - That's cool.

01:13:34.928 --> 01:13:38.457
Now, I want to do my best until I leave.

01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:40.368
(Now, I want to do my best until I leave.)

01:13:41.698 --> 01:13:42.768
Actually,

01:13:44.038 --> 01:13:47.208
there were moments I might have regretted.

01:13:47.808 --> 01:13:49.108
But now that it's the last day,

01:13:51.108 --> 01:13:52.478
I don't want to go home...

01:13:53.078 --> 01:13:54.378
and want to keep living here.

01:13:55.108 --> 01:13:56.848
That's how nice it was.

01:13:57.578 --> 01:13:58.648
Thank you all so much.

01:14:01.818 --> 01:14:03.857
I do have regrets.

01:14:03.858 --> 01:14:05.987
I think I'm full of regrets,

01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:08.027
- He has regrets. - but when I look back,

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:10.028
those regretful decisions were also part of me.

01:14:10.898 --> 01:14:12.027
When I look back on this later,

01:14:12.028 --> 01:14:14.467
I think I'll be able to go forward...

01:14:14.468 --> 01:14:16.167
thinking that I shouldn't repeat the same mistakes.

01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:18.897
- Wouldn't that be about Bon Hee? - So, I think...

01:14:18.898 --> 01:14:20.237
- I think you're right. - I do have regrets,

01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:21.937
- Don't you think so? - but it was very good that I came.

01:14:21.938 --> 01:14:23.018
I think it's about Bon Hee.

01:14:23.438 --> 01:14:24.438
That's what I think.

01:14:24.439 --> 01:14:26.278
How could I not have regrets? I'm human.

01:14:27.008 --> 01:14:28.847
- That's honest. - It's cool.

01:14:28.848 --> 01:14:29.918
So honest.

01:14:31.948 --> 01:14:34.117
I think I'm leaving...

01:14:34.118 --> 01:14:38.157
with such great memories,

01:14:38.158 --> 01:14:40.358
and I got to meet so many great people.

01:14:40.958 --> 01:14:45.058
I hope that our connection continues in the future too.

01:14:48.468 --> 01:14:49.867
Gosh, what is this? What will happen?

01:14:49.868 --> 01:14:51.097
How will this go?

01:14:51.098 --> 01:14:52.438
(Will So Hyun's hopes come true?)

01:14:56.178 --> 01:15:00.408
(The Truth Game that left everyone more confused is over.)

01:15:00.878 --> 01:15:01.907
(I'm curious about something.)

01:15:01.908 --> 01:15:02.918
(What is it?)

01:15:03.118 --> 01:15:07.218
(For Sang Hyeon, I'm obviously his choice when we meet and talk.)

01:15:08.088 --> 01:15:11.157
(I just don't get who he's considering other than me.)

01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:12.158
(There isn't anyone else.)

01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:13.719
(Why would he say something like that?)

01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:15.798
(On the day before the final decision?)

01:15:15.898 --> 01:15:17.858
I am going to ask tomorrow, though.

01:15:18.828 --> 01:15:22.328
(I feel like Sang Hyeon and I aren't a match, and he won't choose me.)

01:15:25.038 --> 01:15:29.308
(Yeon House has gotten more complicated since the Truth Game.)

01:15:31.408 --> 01:15:34.708
(Finally, the day of the Final Decision has arrived.)

01:15:35.148 --> 01:15:37.218
(It's finally today.)

01:15:37.318 --> 01:15:39.548
(I'm still really confused.)

01:15:39.648 --> 01:15:42.518
(I hope my decision doesn't hurt anyone.)

01:15:42.618 --> 01:15:46.028
(I want to get to know more about her outside of Yeon House.)

01:15:47.028 --> 01:15:49.927
(By putting their photo in the drawer, )

01:15:49.928 --> 01:15:53.868
(choose the final person your heart points to.)

01:15:54.298 --> 01:15:55.698
(I have no regrets.)

01:15:55.798 --> 01:15:58.838
(Scan your Love QR Code to check your final match.)

01:16:00.038 --> 01:16:04.338
(Checking their last Love QR Code with nervous hearts)

01:16:05.908 --> 01:16:08.507
(Is this possible?)

01:16:08.508 --> 01:16:09.778
(Will this work?)

01:16:10.548 --> 01:16:12.518
(It wasn't something I had ever imagined.)

01:16:13.288 --> 01:16:14.948
(I think I was surprised.)

01:16:15.588 --> 01:16:19.427
(I knew it was the final decision, but I was very surprised.)

01:16:19.428 --> 01:16:20.787
(If you want to keep seeing each other, pick a time and place...)

01:16:20.788 --> 01:16:24.328
(The final decision will be fixed after 7 days!)

01:16:25.158 --> 01:16:29.127
(After going back to reality and spending a week, )

01:16:29.128 --> 01:16:33.068
(if you meet again, you will become a final couple.)

01:16:33.568 --> 01:16:36.077
(If I go back to my own life for 7 days, )

01:16:36.078 --> 01:16:37.998
(could the feelings that I had at Yeon House...)

01:16:38.238 --> 01:16:39.708
(end up changing?)

01:16:39.878 --> 01:16:43.377
(No one can be sure about the decision in 7 days.)

01:16:43.378 --> 01:16:46.888
(No one can be sure about the decision in 7 days.)

01:16:47.848 --> 01:16:50.357
(After 7 days in reality go by, )

01:16:50.358 --> 01:16:52.828
(After 7 days in reality go by, )

01:16:53.858 --> 01:16:56.627
(will they be able to meet...)

01:16:56.628 --> 01:16:59.897
(at the time and place they promised to?)

01:16:59.898 --> 01:17:02.638
(at the time and place they promised to?)
