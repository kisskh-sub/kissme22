00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.679
Brother Chen

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.560
You were there yesterday too.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.600
Tell them about it.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.520
Yesterday, Chairman Qian and I...

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
...how we discussed it.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.039
You dare to be so arrogant after deceiving my father?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.439
Just you wait, I'll deal with you.

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.320
Mr. Zhao and Chairman Qian yesterday...

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.079
Nonsense!

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.320
Yesterday, Zhao Fengsheng disguised himself as a janitor,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.479
and sneaked into the Qian Group.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:59.679
I gave him a good scolding,

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.960
and then threw him out.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.359
He couldn't possibly have met my father.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.640
Exactly! Right!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.480
How could that be?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.560
Miss Qian is Chairman Qian's daughter.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.680
Darn it, darn it.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.159
It's all over.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.040
Miss Qian...

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.200
Miss Qian, please...

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.560
That Zhao Fengsheng...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.439
...did grow up on Old Street as a child,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.519
but he later did some shady things.

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.680
It has nothing to do with us on Old Street!

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.280
No relation!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.480
He's not connected to us.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.079
No connection at all.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.680
He's a scourge to our Old Street!

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.200
He's not one of us!

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.079
Not one of us!

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.239
He is not our man.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.480
He just grew up here, that's all.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.799
Alright.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.920
The admission matter has been clarified.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.359
Manager Bai will handle the follow-up.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.640
Thank you, Miss Qian.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.200
It's settled.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.680
Let's go.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.599
Miss...

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:55.959
The admission matter...

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.799
...was truly discussed by Mr. Zhao and Chairman Qian.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.079
Isn't what you're doing inappropriate?

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.079
You've all been fooled by this hoodlum.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.120
I'll go back right now and explain to my father...

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.480
...this person's true colors.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.039
She's gone.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.680
Miss Qian really left.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.479
I think...

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.120
It's definitely because of this Zhao Fengsheng.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.919
Right, right, right.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.000
You're devoid of conscience!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.639
Born to be a debt collector!

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.599
Mom!

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.439
I'll beat you to death!

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.080
Ruining your father wasn't enough?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.280
Now you want to ruin Old Street too?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.719
I'll beat you to death!

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.800
Why bring my dad into this?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.400
Stop hitting him!

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.280
I'll beat you to death!

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.199
And what did I even do?

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.599
Neighbors!

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.439
Stop fighting!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.120
Don't resort to violence!

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.719
I really did talk with Chairman Qian.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:35.800
Even now...

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.120
you're still lying through your teeth.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
Miss Qian already exposed you.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.520
And you're still pretending here.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.439
Drive him out of Old Street!

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.199
Get out! Get out!

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.759
Get out!

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.400
Get out!

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.280
What are you doing?

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.960
So you're being unreasonable, huh?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.199
What do you mean, 'what'?

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.319
Don't you like being with him?

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.719
Then you can both get out!

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.680
Get out of Old Street, all of you!

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.120
Get out!

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.719
You can't insult Shengzi anymore!

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.479
Ya Qing.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.000
Calm down.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.199
Auntie is right.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.120
After Old Street's admission,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.680
we need a stable environment.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800
Him leaving...

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.879
is a good thing for everyone.

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.919
You think I don't dare to teach you a lesson?

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.840
Er Ni.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.759
Wake up!

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.000
You've been chasing Zhao Fengsheng for so many years.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.439
When has he ever been good to you?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.240
You're throwing yourself at a man.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.560
Have you no shame?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.280
Auntie.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.680
As long as Ya Qing is happy,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.960
I'm willing to give him credit for Old Street.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.479
Yu Chen.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.759
Why put yourself through this?

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.639
For Ya Qing's sake,

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.840
I'm willing.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.840
You're so kind-hearted.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.240
Zhao Fengsheng leaving is good for Old Street.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.680
If he can prove his innocence,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.199
I'll personally send someone then

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.599
to bring him back to Old Street.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.599
For you,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.400
I'm willing to compete with him fairly.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.960
And you're still putting on an act with me?

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.960
Er Ni.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.560
Look, Yu Chen has gone this far.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.000
What more are you fussing about?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.919
Come home with me.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:49.719
I'm not going back.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.400
All of you, stop this nonsense!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.439
Don't fight, don't fight!

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.039
Neighbors!

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.240
Neighbors, listen to me!

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.360
If you want me to leave,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.199
you have to give me time to pack.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.400
Fine.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.599
As long as you leave,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.439
we'll give you time to pack.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.159
With all your junk,

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.599
a tricycle can haul it all away.

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.120
Two days is generous, right?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.680
Okay.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.599
Two days it is, then.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:11.360
Satisfied?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.639
Good.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.919
Two days from now,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.199
if we see you still loitering on Old Street,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.399
don't blame the neighbors

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.240
for not showing you any mercy.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.759
Right.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.319
Let's go.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.839
Get out! Hurry up!

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.279
Get lost, quick!

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.839
Go.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.279
Get out of the way!

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.920
Move aside!

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.639
Back off!

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.120
Come on, let's go home for tea.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.120
What a piece of work.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.120
You're really leaving, Shengzi?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.160
A wise man knows when to retreat.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.279
If we keep arguing,

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:34.759
we'll all get kicked out today.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.079
So be it if we get kicked out.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.240
I'm going wherever you go.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.600
Otherwise, you'll disappear for another five years.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.480
I'm not leaving.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.199
The Qian Group...

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.959
Qian Zongran has the final say, right?

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.439
Get him here to explain personally.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.199
Problem solved.

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.639
It won't take much effort.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:47.920
Alright.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.639
Whatever you say.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.040
Wherever you go, I go.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.199
Wherever you two go, I go.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.120
What?!

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.439
You offended Brother Shengzi?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.959
Dad!

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.720
How can you call a hoodlum 'brother'?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.199
Have you lost your mind too?

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.160
Tianyu.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.680
Zhao Fengsheng isn't as simple as you think.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.680
Come with me to see Brother Zhao.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.839
Explain everything to him properly.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.439
Let's go.

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:15.279
I'm not going.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.639
Let's go!

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.240
Dad!

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.360
Chairman!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.920
Tang Huiyao from the Tang Group is here.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Tang Huiyao?

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:21.839
What does he want?

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.600
Dad!

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.800
He's that hooligan who harassed me last time!

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.639
Tianyu, you go inside first.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.240
I'll deal with Tang Huiyao.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.439
Your Qian family mansion is huge.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.759
In this dump called Bian Shui,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.240
how can anyone live in such luxury?

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.519
Young Master Tang.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.160
Please.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.160
Young Master Tang, please have a seat.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.439
Where's your daughter?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.680
Why haven't I seen her?

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:07.879
Young Master Tang knows my Tianyu?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.759
Your daughter called me a hoodlum at the hotel the other day.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.120
How come...

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.279
...she hasn't come to you to complain?

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:17.839
That's probably because...

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:20.759
...Tianyu didn't know your identity, Young Master Tang.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.560
For any offense...

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.040
...I apologize to you here.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.800
I believe Chairman Qian is also aware...

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.399
...that offending my Tang Family...

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.279
...isn't something...

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.000
...that can be solved with an apology.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:35.639
What do you mean, Young Master Tang?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.759
Speak plainly if you have something to say.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.360
Every industry in Bian Shui...

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.560
...relies on the hard work of my Tang Family.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.519
Now, the Four Great Families: Kong, Wang, Sun, and Zhou...

00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:50.720
...have all submitted to my father.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.199
Chairman Qian...

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.519
...should have some foresight by now.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.240
I understand, I understand.

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.439
In all of Bian Shui...

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.319
...if the Tang Family dares call itself second...

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.920
...no one dares call themselves first.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.519
But Young Master Li Xiangping...

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.759
...just called me the other day.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.519
He said he wants the Qian Group...

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.839
...to be the Li Family's bridgehead in Bian Shui.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.920
Darn Li Xiangping.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.079
Right.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.439
If you were to really take the Qian family...

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:24.720
...it probably wouldn't be easy to explain to Young Master Li.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.600
You're using Li Xiangping to pressure me?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.000
That's absolutely not my intention.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.439
I can't afford to offend either the Li Family or the Tang Family.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:34.600
How about I call Young Master Li...

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920
...and you can talk to him?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.319
No need.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.560
Since the Qian family doesn't know what's good for them...

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.759
...then we'll see what happens.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.720
Chairman.

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.160
It seems the Tang Family is going to move against us.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.560
How about...

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.800
...calling Young Master Li for help?

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.000
Young Master Li...

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.079
...told us to help Zhao Fengsheng.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.399
Who would have thought...

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:24.439
...Tianyu would make it so embarrassing.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.240
This phone call...

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.879
...I have no face to make.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:28.959
Then...

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.879
...we can't just keep dragging this out.

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.159
If the Tang Family sees through it...

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.639
...and realizes our ties to the Li Family aren't that strong...

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.360
...they will definitely move against us.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.759
First, probe the relationship between Zhao Fengsheng and Young Master Li.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.639
See if the Li Family will help us...

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.000
...for his sake.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:50.879
Father.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.320
It seems the Qian family has already sided with the Li Family.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.399
Do we still move against them?

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:57.679
Don't you know what kind of power the Li Family has?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.240
Offending the Li Family now...

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:00.399
...in Bian Shui...

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:02.759
...will there still be a place for our Tang Group?

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.360
Then...

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.320
...what should we do?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000
We can't afford to offend them now...

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.639
...doesn't mean we'll be under the Li Family's heel forever.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.639
It seems...

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.679
...my plan needs to be moved up.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.279
Father.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:18.720
Tell me then...

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.559
...what plan?

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.200
You go find Ghost Wolf.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:25.240
Have him take Old Street with his men.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.399
He can name his price.

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.759
Old Street?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.720
What value does that dump have?

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:32.919
Don't ask too many questions.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.600
Do as I say.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:35.480
Alright.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.639
Uncle Wolf.

00:09:49.159 --> 00:09:51.320
It's this kid who cost me my woman and child.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:55.919
You lost the sand quarry...

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.960
...and you bring this kid to take the blame?

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.639
Uncle Wolf.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.039
I've been with you for five years.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.120
When have I ever lied to you?

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.519
This kid is from Old Street.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.320
He never went for the kill against Zhao Fengsheng before.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.279
Cost me my Xiang.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.480
Later, he even let Zhou Xiaoman escape.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.399
If his sister weren't in my hands...

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.679
...he'd have run back to Old Street long ago.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:27.960
Then I think he has more guts than you.
