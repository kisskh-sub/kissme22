00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.800
Even if you didn't love me
like your real child,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.440
I never thought

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.240
you'd do this to me.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.720
People have to put themselves first.
That's just how it is.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.960
I want to ask you to vote for Mr. Din.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.120
-And what will I get?
-I'll divorce Mr. Din,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.120
just like you asked.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
I will never divorce her.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.040
Even if I lose everything,
I'll still have Sara.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.360
I've lost, Nam.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.400
I've lost… (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.560
So, what now with Din?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.720
Wayo abstains.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.120
I vote for Mr. Pathawee.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.040
I vote for Mr. Chakrit.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560
You're back.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.560
My brother's in trouble, isn't he?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080
You know what's going on?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.160
On a day like this,
how could I possibly miss it?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.240
I'm not sure

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.520
what you hate your brother for.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.200
But what I'm sure of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.760
is that your brother
did everything for the company.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.320
He did everything for the company.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.880
So much that he didn't care
how anyone else felt.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.320
So, if he loses his position today,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.360
it's only fair, isn't it?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.400
I don't even want to imagine

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.560
that you could be this selfish.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.640
Even if I weren't,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960
you'd never choose me anyway.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.320
That's not true.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.160
Ever since we were young,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.400
I've always believed

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.360
that deep down,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.880
you're gentle and kind.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.480
But maybe you're scared

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.800
to show people who you really are.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.080
And I've been waiting

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.960
for the day

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.079
when your true self
would overcome that fear

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.040
and become a better version of you.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.040
Stop being such a coward

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.000
and hiding under Ms. Namnuan's shadow.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.880
Unless you want to be selfish
for the rest of your life.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.760
The votes are in.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.760
Excluding Mr. Wayo, who abstained,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.040
and Mr. Apo, who didn't attend,

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.280
I've won.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.840
Thirty percent to 26.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.480
I'm sorry, Mr. Pathawee.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640
Thank you.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.920
Even if you're only
saying it out of courtesy.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.560
So,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.440
do you want to say a few words, Din?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.960
Since you've held this role for so long,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.560
I'll give you a chance to say farewell.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.000
Go ahead.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.840
Sorry I'm a little late.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.960
I'm still a shareholder, aren't I?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.920
Nam.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Where on earth have you been?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.880
We'll talk about that later.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.080
Right now, what I need to know is,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.120
I still have the right to vote, correct?

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.720
Yes.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.600
You own shares in this company.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.320
So, of course, you're entitled to vote.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.000
We couldn't reach you.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.120
Mr. Pathawee must be…

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.160
quite surprised.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.800
Well… quite a bit.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.320
But nothing's going to change now.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.960
Then I'd like to cast my vote for…

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.360
Mr. Pathawee.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.480
What nonsense is this?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.920
Your son flipped the whole thing around.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.360
We were leading, suddenly Din wins.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.360
And you…

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.120
You abstained on Wayo's behalf.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.160
Otherwise, we could've
still balanced the votes.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.240
It's ruined. Completely ruined.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.400
Ruined because of you and your sons.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.920
I'm sorry.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.440
I was sure we'd win,
so I didn't want to force Yo.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.160
I didn't think Nam would do this.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.480
Then what was Nam thinking?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.560
Didn't he fall out with Din?

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.360
I don't know.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.200
He definitely ran off because of Din.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.600
But I don't get why this happened.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.680
"Don't get it"?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.760
Is that all you can say?!

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.040
Stop being such a coward

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.120
and hiding under Ms. Namnuan's shadow.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.560
Unless you want to be selfish
for the rest of your life.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.800
Mr. Nam, I'm sorry

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.800
for speaking to you so harshly.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.160
And thank you so much for helping Mr. Din.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.200
What's that message?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.880
Why do you look so sad reading it?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.880
She thanked you as his wife, didn't she?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.280
Can I…

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.559
crash here at your cafe tonight?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.760
I don't want to go home.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:38.600
Don't wanna see anyone.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.720
Of course. Then…

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.240
sleep in the back room.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.880
I'll get it ready.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.360
But don't worry.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.680
I'll work for the bed.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.320
Good.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.600
Really, Din?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.000
You actually won the vote?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.040
Yes! There you go, bro!

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120
See you later.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.320
Hey, Din won the vote!

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.800
He's not getting kicked out.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.880
Nam came back in time to help him.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.280
-I'm so glad!
-Really?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360
Yeah!

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.720
Congrats.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.280
Let's go get ice cream. My treat.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.200
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.480
Three chocolate bars, okay?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.080
I'd even go for ten.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.720
My brother didn't get fired today.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.400
Let's celebrate!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.280
You're not jealous of me.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.360
You're jealous of Sarach.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.280
You snake.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.520
I'm here to return your money, Uncle.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.560
Not all of it yet,
but there isn't much left.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.400
I'll find the rest as quickly as I can.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.320
Because the gift set
is selling very well right now.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.280
Investors from other companies
are interested in scaling it up.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.200
So, I wanted to pay you back first.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:36.920
Glad to hear that.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360
I'll excuse myself.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.320
Well then, I'll take my leave.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.600
Wait, Din.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.680
Hold on.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.600
I didn't mean to hurt you or Nam.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.200
I understand.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.360
Your father lent my family money.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.600
Of course, he expects returns.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.640
That's reasonable.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.960
I'm just worried about the vote.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.680
I'm afraid Nam will think poorly of me.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.000
If that's the case,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.920
it's up to Nam.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.600
I'll be going now.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.280
Hello.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.560
I knew you'd be here.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.400
This is lightly roasted Panama Geisha,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.160
a delicious cup I just tried.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.000
I'm sorry
for speaking to you badly earlier.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.920
It was my fault.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.360
When I got angry,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.920
I only viewed you negatively.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.840
So, you came here because you felt guilty?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.800
Yes.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.360
And to say thank you

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.480
for… helping vote for Mr. Din.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.160
I think
you see me in too positive a light.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.200
I only did it because it benefits me.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.000
So you knew
Mr. Din would be more beneficial to you.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.360
Are you being overly biased toward him?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.960
I married your brother
for benefits too, you know.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.000
No one knows it better than I do.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.680
So, there's no need
to keep pretending anymore, right?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.640
No, there isn't.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.120
So, you'll leave Din then?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.320
At least then I might still have a chance.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.040
Your brother made a terrible coffee?
Why are you choking like that?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320
It's not that.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.960
I was just surprised you spoke so plainly.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.520
Things have changed now.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.800
Mr. Praphop intends
to take over the company.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.040
Your stepmother
sold all her shares to survive.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.080
But Mr. Nam

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.760
was like a knight in shining armor
coming to your rescue.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.840
So, we don't have to hide secrets from
someone who stood by us in our hardship.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.120
But… You shouldn't say that.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.320
Why not?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.200
What if he decides
to try to hit on you again?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.120
Then everything we've done
would be for nothing.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.840
You think Mr. Nam won't change his mind?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.960
Who knows.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.960
Or do you want him to go again?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.680
We're not tied
to each other anymore, are we?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.720
Hey, sorry. I didn't mean it.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.280
I'm sorry, Sara.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.080
Hey, Sara. Wait. Hey.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.680
It's already late in the afternoon.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.760
Might as well get some sugar
in your system, huh?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.160
Water's no match for bubble tea.
Believe me.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.360
Have a sip, please.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.320
I'm sorry.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.480
Where is he?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.520
Sorry I spoke without thinking.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.120
I didn't mean to insult you.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.960
I'm just happy being with you like this.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.920
And I want to stay like this
for a long time.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.960
So, I got scared
I wouldn't have a moment like this again.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.200
That's why I said something awful.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.040
I'm not forgiving you that easily.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.120
How mean.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.920
Well…

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.080
Shall we go home now?

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.760
You're late, and you're saying that now?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.760
If I'm not going home…

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.240
Where else would I be?

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.680
Please.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.440
Careful.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.520
Why are you taking my booze?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.120
This is a cafe, not a bar.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.000
If you want to drink, go outside.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.040
You'll get wasted and wreck my place.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.320
You said you care about me.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.040
So?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.120
How's that broken heart of yours?

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.440
Ms. Sarah came by today.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.800
She admitted it.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.560
She married for money
to pay her dad's medical bills.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.680
And what did you say to her?

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.920
If she said that,
it means you still have hope, right?

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.560
So, you'll leave Din?
At least then I might still have a chance.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.480
I'm sorry.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.680
I'm not going to divorce Din.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080
Why not?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.280
Or are you…

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.440
worried about your reputation?
I don't care about that.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.480
Even if I did divorce him,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.600
we couldn't be together.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.440
I like you as a friend,

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.640
not as someone
I want to spend my life with.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.840
If you know your own feelings,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.240
you'll understand how I feel, right?

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560
Do you really love Din?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.160
What did she say?

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.920
Did she say she loves Din?

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.800
She didn't answer.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.880
But even if she did, she wouldn't pick me.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.880
It'd be like you and Din,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.040
just brother and sister.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.000
Nothing more than that.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.040
You get it now?

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.880
If you do, give me back my drink.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.520
Go get a new glass.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.800
CHERRY

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.480
Posted the clip already, Cherry.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.080
‎THANK YOU, SARACH

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.680
Ha.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.760
You're even more dramatic
than the original clip.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.080
Hello. Today I'm sharing my experience
of having an allergic reaction to a cream

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.280
from a company
that starts with the letter P.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.920
Let me tell you,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.160
you can buy this cream
pretty much anywhere.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.760
Whoever said it's good, I'll say

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.320
it's definitely not.
My face broke out in a rash.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.920
-I had to see a doctor, everyone.
-This is bad news, Sara.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.520
Hey.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.280
Well…

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.600
You…

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.600
can sleep on the bed.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.280
Hey, hey. Listen.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.880
Don't get any gross ideas.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.240
I just felt sorry

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.240
seeing you sleep on the floor for days.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.320
If you try anything nasty,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.720
I'll zap you with my taser.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.480
Hey, I haven't even
thought about anything.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.440
I was just surprised
you allowed me on the bed, that's all.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.600
And too bad,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.760
your taser was left in the car.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.760
Hey. You…

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.880
What are you doing?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.360
Back off.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.840
At first, I didn't think of it,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.920
but now I'm starting to.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.400
Hey! No, don't! Don't do that to me!

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.000
Your scared face is kind of hilarious.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040
Eek! Ah, don't!

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.400
Wait, you're gonna…

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.600
-Ouch.
-Was that funny, huh?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.720
-What's so funny, huh?
-Don't.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800
-What's so funny?
-Hey.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.120
Hey, pick up the phone first.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.240
Quick, the phone's ringing.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.000
Don't!

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.480
Hello, Sarach?

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.200
What?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.200
When I posted that clip
after trying that famous cream,

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.320
I thought I was the only one
who had a reaction.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.600
But my inbox blew up.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.320
We had to go to the hospital as a group.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.840
And look at this.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.040
I, Ying Noi, sacrificed myself

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.160
and showed my face.
Look, it's totally wrecked.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.920
And we've got medical certificates too…

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.440
Thousands and thousands
of comments, reposts, likes.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.160
We're totally screwed.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.560
But I already checked.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.360
Our cream doesn't cause a reaction.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.840
Even you, with your sensitive skin,
can use it just fine.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.400
Someone is sabotaging us.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.040
I've already explained it
to the authorities.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.240
Even if we have to halt production,

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.280
we won't owe fines to other companies.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.880
Because once we restart production,

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.840
we can make the products in time.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.360
How is that even possible?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.640
Don't try to fool everyone.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.640
Every time you open your mouth,
it's just "bankrupt."

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.680
But you don't even own any shares anymore.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.920
Even if he's lying,

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.560
-you have no right to ask.
-You…

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.120
I've lined up an emergency factory.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.880
We just need to send them
the formula and samples.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.560
If this problem is resolved,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.520
we can still produce in time.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.640
But for now, we have to wait
for the regulators to run their checks

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.920
and approve us to continue.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.480
If we do that,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.560
will we even make a profit?

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.120
It's better than taking a huge loss
from massive fines.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:00.000
So, what about the company's recovery?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.920
Who's taking responsibility
for shareholders who won't get dividends?

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.880
I will.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.200
THIRTY THOUSAND BAHT

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.040
Here's a check for consumer compensation.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.320
This low? How is that
supposed to cover damages?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.120
Have you guys even calculated
medical costs?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.400
Okay, then we'll cover the medical bills.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.920
And we'll take you to the doctor.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.880
My face reacted, not my leg.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.840
I can walk to get treatment myself.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.760
I'd rather fight for the consumers.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.480
No way I'll let this go quietly.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560
Come on. Let's go.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.120
I don't want to be around phonies.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.080
Stop acting sincere.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.440
Excuse me.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.840
Are you Ying Noi from TikTok?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:25.560
I'm a fan of yours.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.520
PD Company's been ripping off customers.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.880
I'm rooting for you.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.720
You're amazing standing up for… Oh.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.640
Fighting for others.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.240
Can I get a photo with you, please?

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.160
Mhm.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.520
Don't forget to take your mask off.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.880
I want to see your pretty face.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.280
Just a little.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.440
Sure.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.360
Exactly like Sarach said.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.520
Their faces are fine. It's all made up.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.720
Check this out.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.480
We got info on that woman. This Ying Yoi--

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.120
-Ying Noi!
-Yeah, whatever.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.760
This Ying Noi Yoi Toi

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.200
has been arrested before
for blackmail and scamming stores.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.840
I feel bad for Sara and Din, really.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.600
When things go viral,
people try to ruin it.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.520
The bad luck just keeps piling up.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.120
True.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.720
Now it's just down
to those two over there.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.000
Let's see what they find out.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.120
Keep pushing the attack.
Make it worse than before.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.920
When money talks, anything's possible.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.320
Welcome food for the star.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.520
Thank you, sir.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.520
You didn't disappoint me in choosing you.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.440
You gave me the chance.
I'll give it my all.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.040
Come on. Sit down.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.000
All right.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.440
Wait. Hold on, sir.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.280
Let go! What is this, sir?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.640
Hiring people to spread rumors.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.360
Sabotaging the gift set
without my permission.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:02.760
Do you know how much profit
we lost because of that?

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.720
Next time you do anything
without clearing it with me first,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.120
you'll pay big time.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.040
And one more thing to remember by heart.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.160
If this blows up publicly,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.040
don't expect me
to come running to save you.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.600
But I never showed my face, sir.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:22.840
I had my people handle all of it.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.480
Don't worry, sir. There's no way
this will trace back to us.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.000
Absolutely not, sir.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.320
No, no, please! Don't, sir. Please don't!

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.000
If this happens again,
you'll get hit hard.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.480
Chakrit.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.560
I'll warn you as someone who knows you.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.360
Play with fire and you'll get burned.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:28.840
You're worried about me?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.040
Or are you scared
I'll go after Nam instead?

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.040
You don't know my father like I do.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.640
My father only loves three things.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.320
Me, my mother, and whatever brings profit.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.440
If you can't bring profit,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.360
prepare yourself.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.520
You got it?

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.640
Yeah.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.320
Crystal-clear 4K footage.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.880
Add fraud charges
and we can wipe them out.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.320
Too bad we don't know
who actually paid them.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.560
Not hard to guess.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.880
People like that
never let evidence point back to them.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.280
For now,
just get Sara and Din out of the picture.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.760
These creams ruined our lives.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.720
The gift set was hyped like crazy.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.440
But when something goes wrong,

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.440
the company
doesn't bother to look after us.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.800
And on top of that,
they want to buy our silence.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.800
How are we supposed to live
with our faces ruined like this?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.960
Exactly.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.200
Lying, stirring the pot.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.880
None of what you said is true.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.400
Their real faces are flawless.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.080
Those rashes were just makeup.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.240
Where did that mouthy kid come from?

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.720
You say we lied. Got proof, or what?

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.160
Come and see for yourself.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.840
Today I want to talk about
the two women who made a fuss,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.440
saying they were allergic
to company P's cream.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.000
Turns out they were hired to do it.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.400
They were paid to discredit a competitor.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.000
UNITY IS STRENGTH

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.200
Posted.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.040
Two women crying, "allergic to a cream."

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.360
But wow, those two divas

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.000
actually have fraud cases in their past.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.200
PD would cover their medical bills,

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.320
but they didn't even want to go.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.040
There's something fishy about them.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.840
STORM

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.320
You keyboard trolls!
Stop hiding behind fake accounts

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.080
and attacking people.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.400
If you claim we're lying,
prepare for a court summons.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.880
Then see you in court, ma'am.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.520
Who's that? Go check it out.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.920
I'll deal with these trolls first.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.720
What?

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.720
-What?
-We're screwed. The police are here.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.640
What?!

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.160
Where do we hide? Oh no.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.680
Go!

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.760
Run. Go away!

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.640
I told you this would happen,

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.640
and you messed up.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.920
-Krit!
-Don't.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.880
It's fine.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.880
I'll take responsibility, sir.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.040
But I never showed my face.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.200
And the people I hired,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.640
-I already told them to disappear.
-As they should.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.159
If they were dumb enough
to let this blow back to us,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.760
you wouldn't be standing here
for me to slap you.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.120
At least,

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.760
I can pressure Din to step down as CEO.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.960
So, it's not all bad for us.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.880
That's why you get another chance.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.040
Work properly.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.840
Don't screw me over again.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.639
Yes, sir.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.960
-Krit.
-I'm fine.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.760
You shouldn't have tangled with them.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.840
Don't worry about me.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.120
I won't die from this kind of pain.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.240
I can take worse. I'm not scared.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.400
If it helps me beat
those Phimarndech people, so be it.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.600
Hi, kids.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.480
-Hi!
-Hello!

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.080
The reason I called is,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.280
I want to thank you for your help.

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.240
If it weren't for you guys,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.240
we'd be in deep trouble for a long time.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.120
No problem at all.
We're family, of course, we'll help.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.800
I just want to be useful for Din too.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.640
Make up for never helping him before.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:43.600
Oh.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.840
Mr. Din said he'll find time
to take you all out to eat sometime.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.400
Get ready.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.240
-Yeah! Celebrate!
-Free food!

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.200
Then I want a Thai barbecue,
buffet style. I'm going all out.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.880
That day, I'll skip eating
for like six hours first.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.280
Are you going to eat or have surgery?

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.040
You're asking for trouble, huh?

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.360
I'll stop bothering you.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.120
See you later.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.240
-See you!
-See you.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.480
Thank you!

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.040
Free food! Free food!

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.720
-Thanks for helping my brother.
-Yo!

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.280
You betrayer!

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.440
What are you talking about, Cherry?

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.160
Why would Yo betray anyone?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.480
Right, we all helped fix things
for those two siblings.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.280
He's just using his brother as cover.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.080
Yo, you can fool whoever you want,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.760
but you can't fool me.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.400
You and Sarach are obvious as hell.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.120
You don't even care about
my feelings as your friend.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.080
Come with me, Cherry.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.760
See? I told you.
They've gotta like each other.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.680
The more you know,
the more you swoon, right?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720
Ow, that hurts.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.600
Why'd you pinch me? That hurts!

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.120
Stop talking.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.360
Wayo really has a crush on Sarach.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.720
Love isn't defined by gender these days.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.320
If it feels right, it's right.
Don't overthink it.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.400
Still won't shut up?

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.360
Look at your friend's face.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.320
Come here.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.360
Let go. I said let go!

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.680
When did I ever betray you?

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.560
We just fistbumped
and hugged to celebrate.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.360
Ruj and Namnueng were there.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.120
Bullshit.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.520
Your eyes practically
swallowed Sarach whole.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.520
You think I didn't see that?

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.520
That's funny. Are you overthinking?

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.120
Then swear
you don't have a crush on Sarach.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.320
If you feel more than friendship
for Sarach,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.600
may Sarach hate you forever.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.560
Hmph.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.080
I knew you wouldn't dare swear.
You like Sarach.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.640
Why would I?

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.400
What are you saying?

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.640
We're close

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.000
just because
our siblings married each other.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.040
That's all.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.560
Then swear it.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.480
I swear I don't have a crush on Sarach.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.440
If I do,

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.840
may he hate me for life.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.840
Hear that?

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.960
We're not friends. You're the rich kid.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.920
I'm the gardener's kid.
We've always been on different levels.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.720
Because of the drama
over the cream scandal,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.240
I'll take responsibility for this
by resigning.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.520
The next CEO of PD will be…

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.120
Mr. Chakrit.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.760
I've had to swallow a lot

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.560
from your dad's womanizing

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.640
and putting up
with your mom squeezing money.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.280
My mom's already dead.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.720
Your mom? Dead?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.200
She actually just left you!

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:01.520
