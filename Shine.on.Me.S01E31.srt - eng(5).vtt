00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440
Aunt

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.220
is a real go-getter.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.780
Coming from a humble background,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
she had to drop out of school
right after junior high.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.600
Uncle was a college student back then.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.780
He joined a design institute
the moment he graduated.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.420
He always bragged

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.820
about how he was quite the catch
in his day.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.080
But in the end,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.860
Aunt swept him off his feet

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.160
in no time.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.640
Later, Uncle left the institute

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.780
to start a business with Aunt,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.979
which eventually became
the Chengrui we see today.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.580
Uncle is the boss on paper,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.320
but actually, Aunt is the one
calling the shots

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.300
on everything,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.540
both at home and in the office.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.560
I could tell

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.360
when we were at Changbai Mountain.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.300
I think

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.100
it's a great dynamic

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.380
and pretty low-maintenance.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.100
Don't you agree?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.460
I don't.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.120
How can the man of the house
just take the easy way out?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.700
Don't you go picking up
bad habits from my uncle.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.160
Fair point.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.340
I'll just take the best parts
and leave the rest.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.180
Is Uncle coming by later?

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.620
No.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.660

in Jiangsu Province.

Located by Taihu Lake,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.880
it covers about 65 mu

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.700
there are also large construction

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.400

ways to break through.

Liuguang Garden

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.120

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.400
It reminded me that Feng Teng,

the controller of Fengteng Group,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.020

the concept of "going green"

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.320

I discussed this with the team

[Design Concept]
the first draft of our design concept.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.600
We played off the "Wind" concept

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.280
for "Feng" in "Fengteng",

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.900
with a theme

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.560
of "Setting Sail

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.820
and Braving the Waves."

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.960
The main building
is shaped like a sailboat,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.920
with the podium acting as the hull.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.480
The whole thing looks

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.380
like a giant vessel

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.060

Nie is the lead.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.900
In that case,

she's the expert on this.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.080
Nie,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.980

Mr. Hua and I

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.940
You take it.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.100
I only handle the technical side.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.300
Alright.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.900
I was thrilled

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.500
when I got the call from Ms. Shen

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.300
this morning.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.840
But now that I see

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.260
Chengrui's concept renderings,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.380
I've actually calmed down,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.000
because I've realized

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.460
that the Intelligent Digital Center

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.640
isn't just

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.540
a scaled-up version

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.820
of PV Garden.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.380
Even

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.720
at a basic level,

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.060
the systems involved,
such as the structure,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.700
HVAC,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.940
and all the electrical
and low-voltage systems,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.840
are vastly more complex

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.659
than Liuguang Garden.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.680
I'm not sure

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.220
if we can provide the technical services

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.200
Chengrui needs,

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:45.880
but we will do our absolute best.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.480
I've prepared some materials

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.120
on Liuguang Garden

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.920
and our products.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.440
Feel free to take a look.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.800
I think we're on the same page.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.900
After hearing Ms. Shen's introduction,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.680
I feel that adding a PV system,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.020
promoting energy efficiency

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.940
and responding to the national call

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.340
for sustainable development,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.980
could definitely be a highlight
of the design.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.740
But as for how to perfectly integrate

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.200
PV into the structure,

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.560
we're still figuring it out.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.360
We need time

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.060
to get up to speed.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.460
After the meeting,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.720
we can take you all

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.740
on a tour of our plant

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100
to see

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.500
our PV cell products.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.620
That would be perfect.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
This afternoon, we're planning

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.160
to head out
to the Intelligent Digital Center site

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.040
for another survey.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.940
Would you guys be interested
in joining us?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.820
I'd actually love to go

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.480
and get a feel

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.360
for the geography

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.280
and lighting conditions over there.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.340
But

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.580
I

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.080
have a meeting
with the equipment manufacturers

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.200
and can't get away.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.900
In that case, Mr. Lin, Nie,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.480
you should go along.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.040
- Okay.
- Alright.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.440
Our company

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.040
has a good deal of experience.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.140
It's crucial

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.900
to distinguish

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.360
between BIPV

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.040
and BAPV.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.720
We have some expertise in that area.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.700
Okay.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.800
I'll take everyone to the plant

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.320
since I was heading back anyway.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:59.740
I've been there before,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.780
so I'll skip it today.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.060
I need to discuss some things

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.220
with Mr. Zhang, Mr. Lin, and Nie.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.120
Give me a shout
when you're done with the tour.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.120
We'll meet downstairs

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.240
and head to the site together.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.260
Okay. Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Hua.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.700
This way, please.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:10.600
Please

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.220
come to my office.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.640
Alright.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.080
This is this year's
Shifeng Longjing Tea.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.060
Ms. Shen, give it a try.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.520
Okay.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.860
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.980
Excellent tea.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.460
Ever since Lin got here,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.140
I've finally been able to sit back
and actually enjoy my tea.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.880
It's just a pity
he has to leave so soon.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.960
Fortunately,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.380
Nie is very capable

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.380
and has stepped up to the plate.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.380
I can still

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.560
sneak in a little downtime

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.360
here and there.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.000
I heard from Lin earlier

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.700
that you were planning to go to the US

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.640
for a family reunion.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.980
But now it sounds

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.780
like you're ready to put in
another ten years?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.840
There's some good news

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.659
I haven't told you yet.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.400
Mr. Zhang has decided

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.800
to postpone his retirement.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.180
That's great.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.260
Someone as energetic as Mr. Zhang

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.260
shouldn't be thinking
about retirement just yet.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.180
Lin,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.420
how did you manage to convince him?

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.700
It wasn't me.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.460
Don't even get me started.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.840
My wife kept nagging me to go to the US.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.280
After Chinese New Year,
she lost her patience

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.540
and went ahead without me.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:17.840
Then last month,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.460
she came back in a huff.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.840
She said our son's family

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.140
didn't make her feel welcome at all,

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.460
and she's never going back.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.280
She told me I can do whatever I want.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.380
I thought to myself,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.980
"Well, isn't that just perfect?"

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.160
At my age,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.539
who wants to go all the way to America
and deal with all that?

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.580
It's much more comfortable
staying right here.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.080
Everything is familiar,
and you can't beat the food.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.140
Exactly.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.620
My son has been in the US
for over a decade,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.700
and he only visits once every few years.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.960
How can we ever be as close

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.600
as we used to be?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.480
In the end,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.380
you're just raising them to let them go.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.220
Let's not talk about it.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.460
The government

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.700
did an in-depth survey

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.980
of the PV industry.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.020
I believe

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.000
our hard times are almost over.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.420
The company is ready to take off,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.620
and I'm not ready

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.780
to leave just yet.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:05.980
Besides,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.300
even if I were to retire,

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.840
I'd want to mentor Nie

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.400
until she can

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.080
hold her own.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.780
Then I'll have to be a slow learner

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.140
so you can teach me
for a few more years.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.600
I have two main points.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.460
First,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.760
Yuancheng and Shengyuan

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.740
are also among the bidders

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.840
for the Intelligent Digital Center.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.120
If you get involved with us,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.480
would there be

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.320
any conflict of interest?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.940
Not for me.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.340
I actually feel more fired up.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.740
From what I know,

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.020
Grandpa put Xingjie

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.420
in charge of this project.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.380
Nothing makes me happier
than giving him a hard time.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.800
Thanks for giving me the chance, Aunt.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.860
I figured you wouldn't mind,

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.520
but

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.720
I had to give you a heads-up anyway.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.280
Second,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.700
Fengteng isn't doing
a general contract for this bid.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.320
The design and engineering bids

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.220
are handled separately.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.140
We're bidding for the design.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.640
Even if we win,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.220
it won't be up to us

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.540
whether they use your PV products.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.520
Of course,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.500
during the bidding phase,

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.840
we will pay

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.900
the associated PV design fees.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.040
And if we win the bid,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.800
we'll do our best
to fight for Shuangyuan.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.780
That's fine, Aunt.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.060
The concept

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:12.740
of BIPV

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.060
is still in its infancy.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.460
Being able

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.180
to make an appearance

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:16.940
at such a large-scale bidding event

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:17.920
is already very significant

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.060
for us.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.960
If Chengrui wins the bid,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400
no matter who ends up

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.560
doing the engineering part,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:24.980
it's good news

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.680
for the PV industry.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.820
Very well.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.400
That shows real vision, Nie.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:30.760
Don't worry, Aunt.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.060
If Chengrui wins the design bid,

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.220
we're confident

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.540
we can win the engineering bid
for the PV section too.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:35.580
Okay.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.280
It's beautiful here.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:52.920
Aunt,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.200
aren't site inspections

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.740
usually organized by the client?

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.240
Yeah, they are.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.960
We've been here once already.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.860
But Fengteng is a private firm,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.720
so they're not as strict.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.660
They allow bidders

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.600
to come back
for their own follow-up inspections.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.380
We're just here to take another look

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.200
and gather some extra data.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.920
Let's talk while we walk.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.480
Okay.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.380
Durand's design

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.560
is truly magnificent.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.240
I have total confidence

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.680
that we'll win the bid hands down.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.220
Your design

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.320
is truly magnificent.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.300
I have total confidence

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.020
that we'll win the bid hands down.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.420
Let's hope so.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.200
It's always been a dream of mine

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.160
to leave my mark

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:30.260
on a beautiful land like China.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.500
Let's hope so.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.160
It's always been a dream of mine

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.380
to leave my mark

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.180
on a beautiful land like China.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.140
Our joint work

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.720
will be standing here very soon.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.540
Our joint work

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.420
will be standing here very soon.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:43.880
Sir,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.720
that man walking toward us

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.540
looks like Mr. Lin.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.340
Which Mr. Lin?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.980
What is he doing here?

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.700
Every time I run into him,
it's nothing but trouble.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.420
The woman in the blue suit

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.240
is Ms. Shen from Nanjing Chengrui
Architectural Design Studio.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.060
She's one of our competitors
this time around.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.760
A tiny outfit like Chengrui

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.380
doesn't even belong
in the same league as us.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.400
I have no idea what strings they pulled

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.760
just to make it

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.680
past the pre-qualification round.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.520
What bad luck.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.900
Small world, isn't it?

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.320
Yusen,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.260
what brings you here?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.280
I brought my design team to Suzhou

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.380
for another site visit.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.500
I was actually just wondering

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:39.920
if I should hit you up for a free meal.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.280
Xingjie,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.660
you're in Suzhou

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.880
and you didn't even give me a heads-up?

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.060
I should've at least played
the good host.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.980
Well, I figured you had your hands full.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.800
Besides,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.200
I heard you've handed everything

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.880
at Shuangyuan over to Miss Nie.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820
You lucky dog.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.540
From now on, you can relax a bit.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.100
You bet.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.160
Isn't this Ms. Shen from Chengrui?

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.240
My apologies.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.120
I was so caught up
catching up with Yusen

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.820
that I didn't even see you there.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.880
Sheng Xingjie.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:10.700
Nice to meet you.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:11.880
Hello.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.740
Mr. Sheng,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.300
you are always the center of attention.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.300
So young and accomplished.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.560
You're far too kind, Ms. Shen.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.320
Ms. Shen,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.860
how do you two happen to be together?

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.560
Ms. Shen is Xiguang's aunt.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.860
Since she's in Suzhou,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.000
I'm going to make sure
she's well taken care of.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.340
Look at my memory.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.580
I completely blanked on that.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.980
Well, since she's so close to Miss Nie,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.680
it makes sense you'd be running around

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.200
playing the devoted assistant.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.140
Gotta keep her happy, right?

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.320
Exactly. I'm just playing tour guide
for the day.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.800
By the way,

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.180
Ye Rong,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.380
I heard you and Miss Nie
were classmates?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.000
Yes, Mr. Xingjie.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:54.840
You should really

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.300
take a page out of Miss Nie's book.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.260
Look at her.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.100
She is about

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.180
to take the reins of an entire company.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.680
Even her boyfriend
gets to enjoy the perks.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.760
Mr. Sheng, I really can't take
that kind of credit.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.040
I'm not running the company.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.460
Even if that is

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.580
the plan eventually.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.320
But for now,

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.220
I'm mostly just leaning

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.640
on my family's shadow.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.360
I still need to work on my character

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.200
and put in the hard work.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.820
I need some real achievements of my own

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.240
before I can really hold my head high.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.400
Right now, I wouldn't dream of

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.220
showing off

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.240
or popping the champagne early.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.500
Xingjie,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.840
Xiguang has always been modest
and low-key.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.560
See?

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.720
You've praised her so much

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.560
that you're making her blush.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.540
You've always been sharp-tongued,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.220
even when you were a kid.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.680
But we're adults now.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.680
You should probably start
thinking about your future.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.240
I'd rather not.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.340
I've already had

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.760
30 years of pure fun, haven't I?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.020
I didn't realize you had

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.780
such a knack
for getting under people's skin.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.940
You've known that for ages, haven't you?

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.240
And Mr. Nie used to "compliment" me
on it, remember?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:22.960
True, but I think

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.360
that's the first time
I've seen it in action.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:25.480
Impressive.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:27.980
Right back at you.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.860
You're pretty good yourself.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.060
Right?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.420
I was pretty snarky too, wasn't I?

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.180
Incredibly so.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.220
Alright, you two.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.620
Quite the double act.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.340
Both of you are impressive.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.520
Your uncle mentioned him to me

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.500
after that banquet,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.460
but I didn't quite believe him.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.240
He's from a prestigious family,
after all.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.480
I never expected

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.080
the future head of the Sheng family

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.060
to be like this.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.480
That remains to be seen.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.540
The crown is still up for grabs.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.840
Lin, do you want to...?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.240
Not really.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.140
I've got other things on my plate

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:01.880
and don't have time for Shengyuan.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.080
Very well.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.480
Spoken like someone with real ambition.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.980
You were sharp

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.460
to keep quiet about our partnership

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.280
back there.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.980
Of course not.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.780
In our company, nobody
except the core team

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.000
will know a thing

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.900
until the bids are opened.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.900
I thought we were out of luck

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.540
bumping into Sheng Xingjie

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.640
like that.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:21.880
But he didn't seem

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.680
to suspect

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:23.580
a thing.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.200
He just thinks I'm playing up

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.080
to my girlfriend's aunt.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.060
I guess my reputation
as a devoted boyfriend

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.880
is pretty solid

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.120
and quite impressive, wouldn't you say?

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.640
You never miss a single chance

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.560
to brag about yourself, do you?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.740
A firm the size of Chengrui

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.900
actually trying to compete with us?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.620
They're punching way above their weight.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.800
Still, Lin Yusen always seems

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.580
to get in my way.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.020
I have to keep an eye on him.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:53.440
Ye Rong,

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.520
since you and Nie Xiguang
were classmates,

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.600
find a chance to feel her out.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.760
See if they've got any tricks

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.520
up their sleeves.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.260
Will do.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.400
[Huaya Bank]

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:09.420
Zhuang.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:14.099
Man, you look

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.859
like a mess.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.420
Is it because of those rumors?

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.900
Don't worry, nobody's buying it.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:23.760
What rumors?

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.380
Well.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.060
I have no idea

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.380
who started this,

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.560
but word is going around

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.300
that your team went
to Changbai Mountain for vacation

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.480
and you and Kevin

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.040
got into a huge fight over Chris.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.660
Supposedly Kevin fell off the mountain

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.500
and ended up with a brain hemorrhage,

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.740
so you were forced to stay behind

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:42.740
and look after him for days.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.900
Seriously, don't sweat it.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:47.920
No one is taking this seriously.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.120
The whole story

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.340
makes no sense.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.060
If you actually laid a hand on him,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.540
who would be crazy enough
to leave you there

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.200
to take care of him?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.740
But honestly,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.120
everyone's pretty impressed by you.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.660
What?

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.440
Impressed that you know
how to work an opportunity.

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.280
I only found out

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.500
because of this whole mess.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.620
Turns out

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.080
Kevin's uncle

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.340
is that guy.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.840
Since you looked after Kevin

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.620
while he was hurt,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.600
he's bound to return the favor.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.160
Zhuang,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.060
I've gotta say,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.900
you're a total dark horse.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.020
I didn't realize your intel
was even better than mine.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.280
I really need

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.140
to pick up more from you.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.260
Keeping your head down and working hard

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.460
is nothing compared to knowing
how to seize the right moment.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.720
No wonder Mr. Song

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.980
only took you to Investment Banking.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.720
We joined Huaya

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.400
at the same time.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.620
So when you make it big,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.600
don't forget about me.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.300
These rumors are ridiculous,

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.500
but they've spread like wildfire.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.960
Even the higher-ups
are asking me about it.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.620
After all, you know Kevin's

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.700
family background

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.740
and who his uncle is.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.680
I had no idea.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.300
Anyway, I already tried

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.140
to clear things up for you.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.840
But they don't buy it.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.720
This is a small circle
and word travels fast.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.480
It's casting a poor light

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.840
on you and the bank.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.980
Look, I know it's all nonsense.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.680
But you should think

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.620
about why these rumors started

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.580
in the first place.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.500
Why are they targeting you?

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.000
Is there something wrong

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.400
with how you interact

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.140
with your colleagues

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.160
to make them think

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.440
you didn't get

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.820
this opportunity

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.760
through sheer talent

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.460
but by playing

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.520
the social game?

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.140
Alright,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.080
you're a smart guy.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.220
I'll leave it at that.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.220
Well,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.320
what are you still standing here for?

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.380
I don't want people to think

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.300
I'm giving you special treatment.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.460
Get back to work.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:51.440
Thank you, Mr. Song.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.060
It's important for young people

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.060
to focus on the work at hand.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.540
Keep your intentions pure.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.900
That's the only real way to succeed.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.700
Zhuang.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.000
I'm so sorry.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:24.920
I took a fall

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.120
and you had to spend
all those days taking care of me,

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.940
and now you're getting
dragged into these rumors.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.040
That's...

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.480
It's fine.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.640
It was an accident.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.080
You're not going
to start avoiding me, are you?

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.640
I mean,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.880
I'm a victim

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.580
of these rumors too.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.540
I got in here

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.720
on my own merit,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.580
but now everyone says
it's because of my relatives.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.800
It's so annoying.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.260
If you distance yourself
from me because of this,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.600
I'll feel so wronged.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:52.940
It's not that serious.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.280
We'll just prove ourselves

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.260
through our work.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.040
You're right.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.540
Let's do this together.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.280
Kevin, when you get home,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.720
take a photo of that accident report

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.380
from Changbai Mountain

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.200
and post it on your Moment.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.020
At least it'll prove

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.540
you didn't get hurt

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.000
because you were duking it out

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.460
with Zhuang Xu over me.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.780
That's so ridiculous.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.360
Where did this

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.560
even start?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
It's been so long.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.100
Who knows?

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.520
It's probably been circulating
for a while

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.180
and we're just now hearing about it.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.480
Zhuang is sharp

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.520
and capable.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.320
I think

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.800
someone's been gunning for him
for a long time.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.700
Most people
don't actually believe the rumors

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.880
because they're just so ridiculous.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.340
But they still get a kick

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.600
out of whispering behind our back.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020
They always make sure to add

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.580
a "we know it's fake" at the end.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.300
It's like they're using it
as a legal disclaimer.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.140
That's the worst part about these rumors

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.620
because you can't even debunk them.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.880
It's disgusting.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.460
They're

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.700
making me out
to be this total femme fatale wreck.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.000
Forget it.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.340
Try to look on the bright side.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.100
At least they're saying
you're being fought over.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.760
If they said you were
throwing yourself at the guys,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.120
that would be even nastier

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.560
and way harder to live down.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.860
It's hard to just look
on the bright side, okay?

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.800
Once people start looking at you
through a certain lens,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.900
they never stop.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.300
It's bound to

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.520
tank my professional reputation.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:03.980
This rumor is going

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.260
to follow me forever.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.140
Thinking about it

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.380
just makes me
feel so frustrated and powerless.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.620
I just heard Zhuang Xu...

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:20.640
What's the deal with him?

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.200
I thought he was in Investment Banking.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.820
Hold on.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.420
It's the same old story.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:24.880
He...

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.640
I'll tell you all about it in a bit.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.340
Okay.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.080
I see how it is now.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.520
The more above it all
they act on the surface,

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.680
the more they're buttering people up
behind the scenes.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.680
Exactly.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.200
How else do you think

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.020
he got into Investment Banking so fast?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.460
And here you guys were,

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.620
singing his praises earlier.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.720
Honestly,

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.740
there's no shame in being a brown-noser

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.740
or using your connections.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.520
But acting like it was

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.000
all your own hard work?

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.640
That's really obnoxious.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.900
That's the worst part about these rumors

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.200
because you can't even debunk them.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.460

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.340
making me out

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.720
Forget it.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.000
Try to look on the bright side.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.820
At least they're saying

to our campus today?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.820
I was hoping to grab a bite with you.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.520
Yeah, sure.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:25:59.940
Ms. Nie, you're here.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.180
Mr. Bao,

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.580
there's no need to be so formal,
is there?

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.280
Nie,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.360
don't hold out on us.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.520
We've heard

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.520
that you're

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.620
the daughter of the major shareholder
at Shuangyuan.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.080
No wonder

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:14.160
Mr. Lin put you

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.140
in charge of the project.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.960
Mr. Bao, you're way too blunt.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.140
Can't it just be that Mr. Lin
has an eye for talent

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.120
and saw some potential in me?

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.600
Oh, definitely.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:24.880
I've worked on enough projects

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.200
to meet plenty of silver-spooners,

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.980
but you and Mr. Lin are top-tier

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.920
when it comes to both skill
and character.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.980
You're hardworking,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.100
though you're definitely not the type
to get the short end of the stick.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.120
Well, it's not like
you're losing out either.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.160
A win-win situation

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.340
is the only way to make things last.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.380
Fair point.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.280
So, what brings you by?

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.840
Just checking on the progress.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.380
Don't worry.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.600
I'm on top of it every single day.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.400
As long as

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.740
those new PV panels

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.420
arrive on time,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.640
we'll

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.640
hit our deadline.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.320
Mr. Bao, come take a look at this.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.780
Coming.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:54.980
Nie,

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:55.940
I'll head over.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.660
Sure, go ahead.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.360
How do you manage to bolt so fast
the second work ends?

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.700
Ms. Nie is inspecting

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.080
the Liuguang Garden site.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.600
She is working very hard,
as you can see.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.000
Since when did you become Ms. Nie?

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.560
I don't recall

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.960
the board of directors
signing off on that.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.600
Mr. Lin, you're a lost cause.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.100
You've already picked up

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.400
those corporate airs.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040
I've actually picked up

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.900
the habit of having hot pot at home.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:47.620
Come over tonight

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.920
for some.

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.040
I'd love to.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:54.820
I'll pick you up at the site.

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.620
That was fast.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.380
Jiang Rui.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:21.880
It's you.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.560
What brought this on

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.580
all of a sudden?

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.720
Why?

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:26.880
Who were you expecting?

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.140
Lin?

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.220
Well, yeah.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.960
We were just about

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.220
to go grab hot pot.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.580
Xiguang, there's something

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.700
I need

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.800
to tell you.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.240
Go ahead.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.280
A few days ago,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.820
Xu suddenly asked me out to dinner.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.820
It was so weird.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.140
I thought

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.120
he had something important to say,

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:48.960
but he just sat there drinking

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:49.840
in silence.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.220
When we left,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.380
he insisted on walking me back
to my dorm

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.120
even though I told him

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.640
not to.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.260
Then, right as we got to the dorms,

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.400
he suddenly started asking

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.620
about our study trip to Europe.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.120
Xiguang,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.600
do you think

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.720
he regretted it?

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.060
Don't worry about what he thinks.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.440
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.820
I know,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.120
I just...

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.620
Actually, there's something

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.540
I wanted to tell you

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.520
during Chinese New Year.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.200
But after seeing how cold Xu was

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.520
at Changbai Mountain,

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.240
I kept quiet.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.040
Before we went there,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.440
Ms. Zhang mentioned

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:26.840
that Xu went to my place

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.800
looking for you
over the summer vacation.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.040
She told him

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.280
you and I had gone abroad to study.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.760
She specifically used
the words "study abroad."

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.220
I double-checked with her several times.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.280
Xiguang,

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.800
remember?

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.260
We left

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.240
in such a rush

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.580
that your international roaming

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.280
wasn't set up,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:40.840
so you were out of reach.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.240
And even if he had called me,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.380
I probably would've had
my phone off anyway

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380
because of the time difference.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.080
He

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.280
might have just been unable to reach us.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.300
Xiguang,

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.960
I can't help but wonder

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.820
if things would be different

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.320
if it weren't for me.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.780
Jiang Rui.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.580
Thank you for dragging me out
on that trip.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:58.960
I think

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.280
I'm much happier now.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.460
Really?

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.100
I didn't mean anything by it.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.600
I think

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.520
Lin is a better match for you, too.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.460
But

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:08.360
since you used to...

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.100
I just want you to be

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.580
with the person you love most,

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.840
without any what-ifs in your heart.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.880
I understand.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.560
♪You are the sun in my life♪

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.800
♪You're the light of my love♪

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.640
♪When I'm lost in the dark♪

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.460
Jiang Rui.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.880
♪Every shadow fades away♪

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.060
Him going to Nanjing for me

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.720
doesn't really change anything.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.340
To me,

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.320
some feelings

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.380
are like the lights
in a stranger's window.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.700
When they flicker on or fade away

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.380
is completely beyond my grasp,

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.900
and impossible to predict;

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:14.860
but there is a kind of love

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.280
that is like a constant sun.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.920
Even with your eyes closed,

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.400
even in the deepest dark,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.760
you can still feel its warmth.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.420
You can feel

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.760
it enveloping you.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.360
The love I felt back then

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.020
was real.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.220
And the fact that it has vanished

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.680
is also real.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.880
I never thought

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.980
I would move on so fast.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.640
But that shouldn't be surprising, right?

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.480
A love that never finds

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.680
an equal echo is fragile and brittle

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.180
compared to a love

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:00.840
that is mutual.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:10.200
♪You came and filled the room
with light♪

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.500
♪You are the sun in my life♪

Lamb rolls.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.160
Beef rolls.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:04.740
Tripe.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.100
Oh, they have ice cream.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.220
This is so cute.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.240
This one?

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.760
Wait, this tub is massive.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.240
It's literally bigger than my face.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:14.800
No way.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.660
This is going straight to my hips.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.540
Let's go.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.700
Let's go grab

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.740
some frozen tofu and spam.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:37.880
The lobster looks pretty good.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:38.940
Should we get one?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.880
Ms. Chen is out today.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.360
Do you even know how to prep it?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.420
Please, it's a walk

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.100
in the park.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.140
Then let's get two.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.300
I can polish off

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.440
a lobster by myself.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.500
Two is fine.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.000
But you have to promise:

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.780
don't try to shove
your leftovers onto me.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.280
I swear.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.280
Alright.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.180
Excuse me.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.580
Could we get two lobsters, please?

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.020
We'll take those two that are fighting.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.040
That should be about it.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.840
Let's go grab some seasoning.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.719
I need to use the restroom.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.060
Go ahead and get the seasoning first,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.679
and grab our go-to drinks too.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:32.940
Got it.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.260
You handle the prep,

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.780
and I'll take care of the broth
and the dipping sauces.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:57.660
Works for me.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.180
Easy on the sugar in mine.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.760
I know.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.420
I thought you said
you knew how to do this.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.680
Turns out, lobsters
are a whole different ball game.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:34.500
Hang on.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.240
I'm trying to figure out

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.380
how this thing is put together.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:47.980
Have you figured it out yet?

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.200
Maybe you could look it up for me?

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.780
I'll use your phone.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.560
Mine's in my bag.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.280
Let me find a tutorial for you.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:11.160
Check this out.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:13.680
Okay, I've got it.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:30.560
Yusen.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.460
You know

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.400
that something happened

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:38.980
back in Shanghai on Sunday,

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:39.460
don't you?

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.900
The moment you came to me,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.240
I already had a hunch.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.640
Then why didn't you ask me back then?

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.920
Because you already came to me.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.160
And then

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.900
you threw yourself into my arms.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.720
I'm gonna go grab some more books
from your study.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.240
I've already finished
the ones I took last time.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.220
Sure.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.180
Good luck.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.100
The last piece is yours.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.040
Didn't you say

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.300
you could finish a whole one
by yourself?

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.300
I did eat a whole one.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.580
The shells are right there.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.340
Count them if you don't believe me.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.840
Let me piece them back together.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.280
You're actually doing it?

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.720
Just eat it already.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.800
Come on, eat up.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.920
I have to head back early today.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:57.760
You're giving me a ride.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.460
I forgot my books.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.100
Can you go to the study
and grab them for me?

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.380
I packed them and left them on the desk.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.100
Sure thing.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.380
Nie Xiguang.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:12.760
Yes.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.620
You swapped my soybeans

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:18.860
for red ones.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:20.800
Yeah.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.180
Found them at the store.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.080
I thought it must be so boring

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.400
for you to practice

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.180
with yellow soybeans.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.460
So I wanted to switch it
to a different color for you.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.920
Hold out your hand.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:53.920
