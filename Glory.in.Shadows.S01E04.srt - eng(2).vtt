00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.480
General.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.070
Nanny Sun tampered with the cushion.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.040
Why didn't you tell?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.590
General, didn't you say last night

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.040
you wanted to see my skills?

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.430
Are you satisfied with them now?

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.950
So this is the reason.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.200
Or I'd have no right

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.230
to bargain with you.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.480
Can you help me now, General?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.990
Alright.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.920
I promised to protect your mother.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.710
Thank you, General.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.000
But if you end up gravely injured,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.710
how would you manage the household?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.350
General, you've fought for years.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.120
You wouldn't grasp the schemes in a household.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.840
If I must rely on you every time,

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.430
how could I manage the household?

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.270
Come on.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.640
I'll see you back.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.750
Have you gotten into character?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.680
This show of affection was
meant to appease Old Madam.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.590
Pay it no mind.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.080
Shen Yaochu,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.520
don't be so ungrateful.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.120
I have overstepped.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.310
Here.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.680
Forget it.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.080
Suit yourself.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.630
Thank you, General.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.120
The sordid affairs
within the household...

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.560
How could I possibly be unaware?

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.360
(This Li Jingchuan…)

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.590
(He picks on me,)

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.190
(yet still tries to play nice.)

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.360
(Seems there's no decent
soul in this family.)

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.310
Sister-in-law?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.870
May I come in?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.240
Come in, quickly.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.030
Sister-in-law…

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.750
Your knee injury must be severe.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.310
I brought you wound paste.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.240
I… I… I…

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.960
Sister-in-law, you're remarkably strong.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.640
You could even

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840
endure such pain.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.750
Nanny Sun has served
my mother for many years.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.710
She's always been greatly valued.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.800
So…

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.080
Mother never paid much heed

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520
to her devious tricks.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.470
Today, you punished Nanny Sun.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.750
You've avenged me,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.600
and also all those she once

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.560
tormented before.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.800
She treated you the same?

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.800
Aren't you the family's young lady?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.120
How dare she mistreat you?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.120
You might not know, sister-in-law.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.310
I was actually adopted by the Li family.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.870
If the Li family hadn't fed me,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.270
I would probably have

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.830
starved on the streets long ago.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.310
So matters like this

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.560
don't mean much to me.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.680
I've always been closest to Jinchuan.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.190
Since he likes you,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.390
I like you, too.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.670
Sister-in-law,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.310
can I come find you to play
more often from now on?

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.910
Of course you can.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.000
(Seems Li Jingchuan's
sister is a decent lady.)

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.640
What did you say?

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.190
Li Jingchuan is alive?

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.240
He has returned?

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.610
Yes.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.240
The Li Manor is holding a grand banquet

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.390
to celebrate General Li's
triumphant return.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.790
So you mean…

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.950
Shen Yaochu is alive, too?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.070
You may leave.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.910
Yes.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.600
Mother!

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.390
What should we do?
Shen Yaochu didn't die.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.270
She's even become the General's wife.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.360
If she asked General Li for revenge,

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.390
then we… We…

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.240
Why are you panicking?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.520
That Li Jingchuan…

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.950
Could he really wipe out our family?

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.270
Well... If you had let me
marry him back then,

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.360
I'd be the General's wife now.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.480
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.470
Mother!

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.800
Would you go to meet your end?

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.040
Li Jingchuan isn't dead, though.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.950
Do you think the Li Manor
is a good place?

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.750
Li Jingchuan wasn't born
of the Old Madam.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.430
If he hadn't left early
to join the army,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.680
he'd have been gone long ago.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.040
But now, he holds great power and rank.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.560
If Shen Yaochu returns for revenge,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.470
what will we do?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.320
Write a letter

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.630
to your father immediately.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.000
Tell him to return at once.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.510
Say there's an urgent matter.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.120
His inspection tour
should be nearly over.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.300
Go, quickly.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.150
Alright.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.750
Shen Yaochu,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.000
fortune truly favors you.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.790
However,

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.480
as long as your mother
remains in my hands,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.920
I doubt you'll cause much trouble.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.720
He still hasn't woken up?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.560
No.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.270
I found the best physicians.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.920
But they can only keep him alive.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.070
Speak to your father now.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.830
Perhaps he might hear you.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.910
No need.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.750
Your son has come to see you.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.480
Do you hear that?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.360
These two sons of yours,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.680
do you favor Jingchuan more,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.120
or is it my Jingxu you cherish?

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.310
This hairpin was your gift to me
on our wedding night.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.720
I gaze upon it every single day.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.430
I kept thinking about
the promises you made to me.

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.800
But you…

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.000
You deceived me instead.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.600
You brought that woman and
her child into this household.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.240
You let that courtesan

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.630
step right over me.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.190
You turned me into a laughingstock
across the entire capital.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.150
So…

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.070
I will make your life worse than death.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.830
And you will watch closely

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.000
as I destroy that woman's
child with my own hands.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.580
(Qifang Pavilion)

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.750
Madam!

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.040
How is it?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.630
Madam, I've found out the details.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.000
There is indeed a Madam Shen
living at Guanyin Nunnery.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.120
It's said the General has arranged

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.000
for the masters there
to treat her with great care.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.510
That's good.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.920
By the way, Madam…

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.080
You're to return to your
mother's in two days.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.270
Shall I start preparing in advance?

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:02.710
To my mother's?

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.720
Where is the General now?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.440
I just passed by the study.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.840
The lights inside were on.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.360
Seems he's yet to rest.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.350
Madam,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.720
is the General not staying here tonight?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.350
If he's not coming,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.160
we'll invite him.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:29.590
Madam.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.510
It's Lady Ruoyi.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.030
I greet you, General.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.670
Who allowed you in?

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.630
I may have wed into the family early,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
yet I've never greeted you, General.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.150
Only today,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.050
I caught a glimpse of you
from afar and came

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.320
to pay my respects.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.790
Understood. You may leave now.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.550
General, you're busy
with affairs all day.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:14.630
Why not let me give you a massage?

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.160
My Lord.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.750
Why aren't you resting yet?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.280
Madam...

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.990
Ruoyi.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.040
Massage.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.080
This is…

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.550
Lady Ruoyi.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.960
So Concubine Qin is here too.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.720
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.440
If you know, why not leave?

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.440
(What's going on?)

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.750
(Could it be he favors
Lady Ruoyi's manner?)

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.870
Lady Ruoyi truly pleases the General.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.870
She can even help relieve the weariness.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.630
I'd like to learn.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.080
Who brought this?

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.360
- It was from me...
- It's what I loathe most.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.750
To the General.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.720
Don't mind me, go on.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.080
I'll just watch.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.910
That's enough, you may leave.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.440
G... General.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.590
I said that's enough.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.710
Leave.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.790
Lady Ruoyi, leaving now?

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.390
I still wish to learn more from you.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.960
Lady Ruoyi, you're still here?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.200
Don't tug at me.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.670
Aren't you afraid

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.270
others will call you jealous?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.160
I fear nothing.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.270
General, we are newlyweds.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.750
I fell for you.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.510
So others can understand

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:21.670
a touch of envy now and then.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.960
General, let's go.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.790
Let's return to our chamber.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.440
I'll just sleep in the study.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.080
You think I'm no good at massages?

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.790
Let me give you one.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.750
Stop.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
What are you up to?

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.080
Will you be free the day after tomorrow?

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.590
Two days from now?

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.550
The day you return to your mother's.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.840
You want me to go with you?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.280
Yes.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.320
But didn't you say

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.280
you wouldn't need

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.360
my help in this family?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.240
(The man's heart is far too petty.)

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.960
(You just want my help.)

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:09.960
Sometimes I speak without thinking.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.670
General, please don't mind me.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.000
The vow we made just yesterday

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.390
has already been cast aside today.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.390
How am I supposed to trust you?

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.390
I offer my apology to you, General.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.670
Stop playing pitiful.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.000
You think I can't see through you?

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:27.870
Since you already know,

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.120
I won't force you.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.840
Get some rest soon.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.200
It's up to you.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.260
(Steadfast Pursuit)

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.870
Madam, is the General truly not going?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.040
It's fine.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.080
I have my own way.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.620
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.320
I have prepared a gift for you.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Do you like it?

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.300
