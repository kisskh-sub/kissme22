00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.340
Zhu,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.860
I still think

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.540
that tattooed man

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.250
killed Li Yiqi in this hospital,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.700
and then you happened to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.860
run into him here.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.940
Why did he visit the hospital so often?

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.780
Do you think there

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.780
might be some connection?

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.810
Okay, I understand.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.780
You take care too.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.370
Sir. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.260
Mr. Bai,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.370
there's something I'd like to report.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.300
Okay.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.180
What is it?

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.050
It's now confirmed

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.900
that Chen Chuchuan
is suspected of murder.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.330
Qi Sizhe is his close friend.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.620
Normally, he should recuse himself,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.580
but he knows him very well.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.860
If he can join us,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.540
it could aid our investigation.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.730
What do you think?

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100
You prepare a written report.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.570
We'll discuss and decide.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.660
But use

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.490
your discretion.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.050
Yes, sir.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.860
[Episode 16]

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.060
Why did Chen Chuchuan come to see you?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.980
He wanted me to believe him.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.820
What else did he tell you?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.220
He only told me

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.890
he was innocent.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.450
What about the new drug?

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.940
If he's innocent,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.340
we'll find the evidence.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.610
We have some

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.690
questions we'd like to ask.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.610
Okay.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.660
Do you know these two people?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.290
Yes.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.010
Do you know

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.820
they're dead?

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.850
Hu Jie is dead too?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.410
I didn't know.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.570
But Jiangxue

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.690
was murdered over ten years ago.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.850
I knew about that.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.700
Tell us about it.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.980
How did you know them?

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.020
I met Hu Jie at

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.170
an art competition.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.220
She was from Lijia Town.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.780
That summer,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.610
she invited me

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.850
to her hometown to sketch.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.900
That's when I met Jiangxue.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.850
The first time I saw Jiangxue,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.490
I fell in love

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.700
with her at first sight.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.810
Later, Hu Jie got very angry

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.290
with me because of this.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.580
Why was she angry with you?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.610
She had feelings for me.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.460
But I only ever saw her

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.540
as a friend.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.900
Later, she told Jiangxue

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.100
to stop contacting me.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.370
We were young then.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.660
I was really afraid of losing Jiangxue,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.250
so I texted her to meet

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.580
the next day

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.730
at the botanical garden

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.810
where we often sketched.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.140
On my way there,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.980
Hu Jie called out to me from behind.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.900
Chuchuan!

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.250
Chuchuan!

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.250
What are you doing here?

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.020
Jiangxue...

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.170
She fell.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.810
It looks bad.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.540
Where's she?

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.730
Over there.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.340
We searched for a long time.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.610
Jiangxue!

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.730
Jiangxue!

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.460
We went everywhere

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.730
but couldn't find Jiangxue.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.780
Later I found out

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.340
Jiangxue had been killed in that

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.980
botanical garden.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.700
And that case...

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.700
still remains unsolved.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.290
I've blamed

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.220
myself all these years.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.250
If I hadn't invited her,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.290
she wouldn't have showed up,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.900
and things wouldn't have
ended up like this.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.660
After Fan Jiangxue died,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.050
did you stay in touch with Hu Jie?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.290
She went abroad later.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.410
So we lost contact.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.810
But a month ago,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.930
she suddenly came to me.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.730
Chuchuan,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.930
that painting...

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.490
Can you paint it for me again?

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.250
After Jiangxue died,

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.050
I stopped painting.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.250
I'm sorry.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.460
Fan Jiangxue.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.610
Fan Jiangxue.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.610
Chen Chuchuan,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.660
it's been fourteen years.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.100
Fan Jiangxue has been dead

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.340
for fourteen years.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.370
Today, you will paint

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.850
the painting, whether

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.540
you want to or not!

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.290
Why should I?

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.490
You...

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.660
You really don't know

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.660
how Fan Jiangxue died, do you?

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.100
Tell you what,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.020
Fan Jiangxue

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.020
had a severe pollen allergy.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.810
I was trying to save her.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.980
But she kept struggling.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.660
In the end, the pen slipped.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.050
Let me tell you, Chen Chuchuan,

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.850
Fan Jiangxue's death...

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.100
was your fault.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.370
If you hadn't

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.780
asked her to meet there,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.900
she wouldn't have gone.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.850
If you hadn't brought
those flowers inside,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.490
she wouldn't have died.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.610
You believe what she said?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.050
My gut says no.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.140
But from my

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.340
professional perspective,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.610
the way she

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.610
told me about these things,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.610
either her eyes

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.940
or her body language,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.300
seemed perfectly natural.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.420
I have serious doubts too.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.610
So I wanted to go back to that

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.460
botanical garden again.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.700
But on my way,

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.730
I got a call from Maggie

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.610
saying you wanted to meet,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.850
so I came straight here.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.490
Why did you go to Qi Sizhe first

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.420
instead of coming here?

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.340
Because he's my friend,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.650
and he's also a police officer.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.460
I wanted to get some
information from him first.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.180
Chuchuan, you know

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.060
I can't

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.130
reveal anything to you.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.460
Is it about Jiangxue's case?

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.490
Is this about Jiangxue?

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.650
Did you get any leads?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.490
Chuchuan,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.490
are you absolutely sure

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.060
you haven't hidden anything from me?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.220
You came here because

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.100
you were certain that after Fan Jiangxue

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.250
and Hu Jie died, we couldn't

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.940
uncover the truth, right?

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:53.460
No, officers.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.220
What do you mean?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.370
Are you suspecting me?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.060
Where were you between
9 and 11 PM on the night

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.700
of October 13?

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.130
I was at the clinic.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.770
Someone can vouch for me.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.370
Who?

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.650
Qi Sizhe.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.010
Have you seen this?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.220
It's about Fei's case again?

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.250
On the night Hu Jie died,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.490
I was indeed

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.770
at Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.700
Why did you go

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.820
to see him that night?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.130
I think someone's making

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.940
narcotics under the pretense

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.490
of making drugs.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.980
And did you find anything

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.890
suspicious about him?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.530
I was at the clinic

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.250
from around 9:30

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.250
to about 11 PM.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.130
Based on Hu Jie's

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.730
estimated time of death,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.820
Chen Chuchuan

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.250
could not possibly be the killer.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.220
Judging from the current leads,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.420
it's about

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.180
a 45-minute drive from

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.890
Hu Jie's place to
Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.850
If he really killed Hu Jie

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.770
at 9 PM,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.610
then left and disposed of the body,

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.850
there's no way

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:55.890
he could have made it back

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.890
to the clinic to meet with

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.010
Mr. Qi within half an hour.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.490
When we met

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.490
at the clinic,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.340
I told you

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.940
Chen Chuchuan was the prime suspect.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.370
Why didn't you

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.300
tell me immediately that

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.980
you were together at
the time of the crime?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.100
How long do I have to wait?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.850
I was only suspecting

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.420
that Chen Chuchuan may be

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.580
connected to the new drug.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.180
I never thought

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.730
that the time of our meeting

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.980
would coincide with

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.530
Hu Jie's time of death.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.610
So Mr. Qi,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.610
you didn't know about

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.250
the relationship between
the two of them,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:44.940
did you?

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.530
No, I didn't.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.940
Let's set aside whether
Chen Chuchuan's statement

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.700
about Fan Jiangxue's case
is credible or not.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.300
The scene has already

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.300
been processed.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.420
Even with all the evidence,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:55.770
we can't confirm

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:56.580
its authenticity.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.820
And now you are Chen Chuchuan's

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.060
alibi witness.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.460
He was counting on that,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.460
which is why he came to you

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.730
before being questioned by us.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.060
Mr. Han,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.460
Xiaoxi says

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.370
the surveillance

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.250
near the clinic shows

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.980
that Mr. Qi and Chen Chuchuan's cars

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.530
left

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.820
at 10:50 PM

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.420
and 11:45 PM,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:21.940
respectively.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.100
No.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.820
How did it go?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.010
No drug residue was found

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.130
in Chen Chuchuan's system.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.300
I also compared it with

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.180
other relevant samples

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:51.940
of the new drug.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.130
None matched.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.650
Chen Chuchuan knew

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.890
Fan Jiangxue and Hu Jie.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.820
We just don't have evidence to

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.130
prove he's related to their deaths.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.890
If we can't find evidence

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.580
in the next few hours, we'll

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.100
have to release him.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.100
I need to check

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.130
Hu Jie's primary crime scene.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.180
Based on bloodstain

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.340
pattern analysis,

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:33.420
the perpetrator

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.820
likely ambushed Hu Jie in her home.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.060
She was attacked as soon as she entered.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.130
Ruan Mingyu said he arrived here

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.010
a little after 11.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.010
So, the killer

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.770
had to kill Hu Jie and clean

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.700
the scene before Ruan Mingyu arrived.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.060
Piercing the carotid artery would

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.250
leave massive amounts

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.100
of blood at the scene.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.010
To clean up

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.010
in such

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.980
a short time,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.610
the killer would have

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.530
had to use bleach or cleaner.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.700
When Ruan Mingyu

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.940
arrived,

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.100
he would have smelled

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.250
a strong odor of blood

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:33.650
or cleaner.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.460
But during interrogation,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.370
he didn't mention anything unusual.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.340
You suspect Ruan Mingyu was lying?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.010
Mr. Han, Mr. Qi,

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.370
the water was shut off here

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.370
the night Hu Jie died.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.940
From 7 PM to 3 AM the next day.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.010
If the water was off

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.580
during that time,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.340
how could all that blood
have been cleaned up?

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.340
According to Hu Jie's

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.580
timeline of death,

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.530
the water was off then.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.530
The killer had no means

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.770
to clean the blood here.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.610
If the scene weren't cleaned,

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.820
Ruan Mingyu

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.850
would definitely have noticed

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.420
something was wrong when he arrived.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.130
And if Ruan Mingyu

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.300
didn't notice anything,

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.130
the only explanation is

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.300
that this place wasn't

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.610
a crime scene yet when

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.300
Ruan Mingyu arrived.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.650
Su,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.340
go check the

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.250
water in the other rooms.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:25.820
Okay.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.180
The water is clear.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.580
The water

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.610
from the other two faucets

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:36.300
is murky.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.340
It's likely no one used

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.250
them since the shutoff.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.700
We were misled from the very beginning.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.980
I suspect

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.890
Hu Jie's body

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.010
was never here.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.010
The killer murdered Hu Jie elsewhere

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.060
and staged this place
as the primary scene.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:01.370
But the timing

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.770
wasn't before Ruan Mingyu arrived.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.900
It was after he left,

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.940
to be precise,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.770
after the water supply was restored.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.620
That's why the water

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:11.900
from that faucet ran clear.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.940
Why would the killer

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.980
dump Hu Jie's body

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.420
in a trash bin?

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.380
Wouldn't that

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.330
make it easily discovered?

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.900
The killer smashed Hu Jie's face

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:23.490
and destroyed her fingerprints,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.010
but left the tattoo

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.660
that could prove her identity

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.900
untouched.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:29.770
He wanted us to know

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.860
the deceased was Hu Jie,

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.860
thereby

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.980
leading us to this

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.290
staged primary scene.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.290
Where is the real primary

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.810
scene then?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.290
I want to interrogate

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.220
Chen Chuchuan.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.940
That's against regulations.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.700
You and Chen Chuchuan are friends,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.700
and

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.380
you're also his alibi witness.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.460
But if you have a reason

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.900
compelling enough to convince me,

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.180
I can seek approval from Mr. Bai.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.620
I suspect

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.730
Chen Chuchuan's clinic

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.330
is the actual primary crime scene.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.660
Having Qi Sizhe interrogate him alone

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.730
is against regulations.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.250
If we don't get Chen Chuchuan

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.140
to let his guard down,

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.900
it'll be hard to get him to talk.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.860
Qi Sizhe

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:38.980
is the only one who

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.810
can make him talk.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.330
But you must keep an eye on them.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.570
Let me know

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.490
if anything happens.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.010
Yes, sir.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.770
Are you here to see me

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.530
or to interrogate me?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.220
Fourteen years ago,

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.940
Fan Jiangxue wasn't killed
by Hu Jie, was she?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.660
Your colleagues have already

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.700
interrogated me.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.290
I have my doubts too,

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.420
and I also need an answer

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.140
and the truth,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.730
you know?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.490
Fan Jiangxue's death

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.660
was an accident.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.460
I'm sorry.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.770
I'm sorry.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.420
Have you found

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.700
any leads from that case?

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.220
I mean,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.290
that wound...

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.220
was an accident.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.220
Chuchuan,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.330
do you remember

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.050
when we were at the bar years ago,

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.980
I saved someone's life?

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.730
Actually,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.140
you had a better chance

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.010
to save him with a cricothyrotomy.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.460
What's wrong?

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.050
Acute allergic reaction.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.570
Chuchuan,

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.220
hold her.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.980
I'll do it.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.730
It's been too long. I don't recall.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.700
Let me refresh your memory.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.810
The fatal wounds on
Fan Jiangxue and Hu Jie

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.530
appear similar at first glance,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:28.940
but the methods used

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.490
by the perpetrator
are completely different.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.700
When the killer murdered Hu Jie,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.290
there was no hesitation,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.860
only huge hatred.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.420
The carotid artery
was pierced precisely.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.090
But Fan Jiangxue...

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.900
Her wound was

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.140
between the carotid
artery and the throat.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.700
That location...

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.860
as you and I both know,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.330
is the spot for

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.420
a cricothyrotomy.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:54.860
Unfortunately,

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.620
due to a slip,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.700
the carotid artery was pierced,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.810
causing massive hemorrhage.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.770
And then?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.050
You're my alibi witness

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.010
for the night Hu Jie died,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.050
remember?

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.140
I can only prove

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.620
you weren't at Hu Jie's home,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.700
but I can't prove
you weren't the killer.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.940
Hu Jie's body

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.010
was in your clinic

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.460
at the time, wasn't it?

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.860
I need to use the restroom.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.250
The toilet inside is broken.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.050
Use the one outside.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.940
Okay.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.730
Hu Jie's body was

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.140
right in that restroom, right?

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.570
You didn't expect me to come.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.330
But at the same time,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.900
my arrival

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.980
created a perfect alibi

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.460
for you as well.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.250
You only needed to prove

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.770
Hu Jie wasn't killed

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.660
in your clinic,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.490
and her death would

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.770
have nothing to do with you.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.140
After I left,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.700
you disposed of Hu Jie's body,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.380
destroyed her face and fingerprints,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.860
and dumped her in the trash bin.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.620
Then,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.460
you went to Hu Jie's home

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.490
and staged the scene.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.250
Am I right,

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.050
Chuchuan?

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.330
After all these years,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.290
this is the first time

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.530
I've seen you work on cases.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.900
Not bad.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.660
Do you remember what Li Ming

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.860
said about us back in school?

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.380
He said I chose to be a psychologist,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.490
taking half a year

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.810
or more to treat a patient,

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.900
with no guarantee of success.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.810
And you chose to be
a forensic pathologist...

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.090
Can you really save people?

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:55.220
More often,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.050
what you face are

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.220
cold corpses.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.980
What are you saying?

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.940
Your deduction is very brilliant.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.660
But investigations require evidence,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.180
right?

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.250
Any findings?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.330
No.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.980
Ms. Zhu.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.290
We conducted Luminol tests

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.180
on every corner

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.180
of the clinic.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.700
No blood reactions whatsoever.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.290
I'm afraid

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.140
this isn't the

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:47.900
primary crime scene.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:50.940
Okay.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.290
There's

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.980
23 minutes left.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.980
The twelve-hour questioning period

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:07.700
is about to end.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.050
What about Song Weimin?

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.530
Does Song Weimin also have

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.250
nothing to do with you?

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.090
If you're already

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.860
convinced

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.460
that I killed Hu Jie,

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:23.420
do you think anything I'm

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.940
telling you here today is the truth?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.730
You just need to answer my question.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.140
What exactly

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.330
happened with Song Weimin?

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.290
I remember we once talked

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.290
about mental illness.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.220
It's different from

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.730
the surgical forensics you

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.140
specialize in.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.460
These patients...

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.980
When they have an episode,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.460
the lies they

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.940
fabricate to deceive their brains

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.050
are the most real

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.420
for them.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.460
Song Weimin saw

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.660
visions of his daughter.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.490
So in his heart,

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.010
he believed his daughter
was still alive.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.860
That was his hope to keep living.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.420
You're the same.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.660
After Yu Fei died,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.770
you kept believing there was another

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.290
person at the crash scene.

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.140
So you keep investigating,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.980
believing

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.490
the Raw Diamond Case isn't over.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.290
You cling

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:24.940
to that like a piece of driftwood

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.660
to survive.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.140
Don't you think you and

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.770
Song Weimin are the same in that regard?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.900
Don't you mention Fei to me.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.090
If you hadn't,

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.330
in your imagination,

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.180
insisted on the existence
of another person

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:44.460
and believed

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.490
that was the truth,

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.770
how could you convince yourself

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.330
to survive through the painful

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.010
rehabilitation?

00:26:59.240 --> 00:26:59.810
Mr. Qi,

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.180
if this new drug

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.490
you mentioned

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.380
could help you see Yu Fei,

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.330
do you think you could resist

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:16.460
that temptation?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.090
So...

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.420
you know the new drug

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.050
can cause hallucinations?

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.090
Just like you,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.250
I'm just speculating.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.420
Chen Chuchuan,

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.090
the medication Song Weimin had

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.770
was from you.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.940
Do you have evidence?

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.220
Chen Chuchuan,

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.250
you can go now.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.050
Mr. Wan,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.250
this is my office.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:33.900
Come in.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.010
So you're saying

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.460
someone secretly took

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.490
ether and cedilanid

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.330
and altered

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.250
the computer records?

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:46.810
That's possible.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.770
According to the duty roster,

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.050
you worked four night shifts this month

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.980
and entered the storeroom twice.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:59.180
Yes.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.980
But I only took regular medications.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.330
I never opened the cooling cabinet.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.810
The footage can prove it.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.050
Is everyone on

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.730
this list here?

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.180
Only Cui Hao is absent.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.290
He's been on leave lately.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.290
But he's on the night shift tonight.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:14.180
I've asked him

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.860
to come in early.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.010
Do you know

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.010
why I eat nuts?

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.730
I don't actually like them.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.220
I hate all kinds of nuts.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.090
Fei liked raisins.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.570
As a kid, she got scolded

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.860
for opening a whole bag

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.010
just to eat the raisins.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.860
So she got clever.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.290
She'd have you eat the nuts

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.250
so she could eat the raisins.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.570
I always thought I was helping her

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.810
eat the nuts she didn't like.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.250
After she was gone,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:05.940
I realized

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.860
she was helping me eat

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:09.980
the raisins I liked even less.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.900
Things can be seen

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.770
from different angles.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.220
Before you see the result,

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:20.220
you never know

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.380
what the truth is.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.420
Chen Chuchuan said that

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.050
just to influence you.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.290
He's a psychologist.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:30.380
He's better than all of us

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.900
at psychological warfare.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.620
Officer,

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:35.570
I didn't do anything.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.380
Please check it again.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.090
Really.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.090
I did nothing!

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.290
You've wronged me.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.330
I really didn't do anything!

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.050
You did nothing?

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.380
Several medications on

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.530
the list that don't match up

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.700
are used in multiple homicides.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.770
Whatever you did,

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.570
you're coming with me.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:53.900
I...

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:02.730
How dare you run!

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.220
Still say you did nothing, huh?

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.810
Now it has everything to do with you!

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.140
See? You assaulted an officer!

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.220
Get up! Let's go!

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.620
Come on!

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.700
A chelating agent!

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.220
Now I know why there was

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.090
no Luminol reaction.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.860
A chelating agent

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.090
is a chemical substance that can form

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.570
stable complexes with

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.330
metal ions.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.530
It's commonly found

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.570
in cleaning agents.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.530
In industrial cleaning,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.010
it's often used to remove

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.330
metal deposits and grime

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.290
from equipment

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.180
and pipes.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.570
Gao Yuan.

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.290
Mr. Qi.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.290
Let me ask you.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.290
What's the principle

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.090
behind the Luminol test?

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.940
The Luminol test...

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.290
Human blood

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.530
contains ferrous ions.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.660
The Luminol solution

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.570
contains hydrogen peroxide.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.620
When combined,

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.490
they react

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.420
to form water and singlet oxygen.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.620
The singlet oxygen oxidizes

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.250
the Luminol,

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:25.180
causing it to luminesce.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.730
That is

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.900
the principle of the Luminol test.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:28.420
That's it.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.460
Can you simplify it?

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.490
So, what if

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.180
the iron ions in the blood

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.490
weren't catalyzed,

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.980
but were chelated instead?

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.490
If the iron ions are chelated,

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.290
they won't catalyze
the hydrogen peroxide,

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.570
and the reaction won't occur.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.290
Then the Luminol won't glow.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.180
Can you stop using

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.380
so many technical terms?

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.810
Keep it simple.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:52.330
There's a solution

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.290
that reacts with iron ions,

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.980
preventing them

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.730
from participating

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.570
in other reactions.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.700
So no matter

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:57.490
how we test,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.180
the Luminol won't glow.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.770
So,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.810
if we detect traces

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.620
of the chelating

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.490
agent,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.290
we can prove

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.290
Hu Jie's primary death scene

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.980
was at the clinic.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:29.490
Hello?

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.530
Yes, they did come to me.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.420
But I didn't say anything.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:37.330
Understood.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.980
Mr. Qi!

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.180
Mr. Han!

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.530
Look here!

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.940
Here too.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.700
And here.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:12.130
Su,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.940
arrest Chen Chuchuan immediately!

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.340
Why are you looking at me?

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:58.980
Get to work!

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.740
Get to work!

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.980
When one loses too much
blood in a short time,

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.050
they'll lose lucidity.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.210
The probability of Wan

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.460
achieving a precise headshot

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:07.300
is extremely low.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.010
There might have been a
third person at the scene.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.050
I found

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.570
the suspect with the tattoo on his neck.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:14.650
He was at the hospital then.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.610
This drug bottle

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:16.740
was found at Cui Hao's home.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.530
Is cedilanid

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.260
the drug that caused Li Yiqi's death?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.260
This is the patient list from
Chen Chuchuan's clinic.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.490
Here are his prescribed drugs.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.820
Mr. Han, we received a tip.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.900
Chen Chuchuan's car seems to be

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.380
heading towards the border
town of Luowang.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.380
Notify Han Feng

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.460
to arrest him immediately.
