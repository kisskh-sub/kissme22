WEBVTT

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.160
It's all over Ice.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.360
You don't have to have nightmares anymore.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.760
Someone sent this letter to you.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.120
The personal cash check

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.400
I have attached to this letter

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.080
is my apology as university president

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.680
And as a request from me as a father,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.440
stop contacting Saint

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.080
before my son is put in even more danger.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.560
Ice...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.320
You're choosing him?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.000
Fine. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.440
I’ll do this for your mother’s sake.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.600
Go wherever you want.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.680
But don’t expect me to help you.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.840
I won’t give you a single penny.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.200
Wait for me a little longer, I’ll do everything.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.600
So that my dad can't do anything to us anymore.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800
Even though

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
even if you’re not yet the billion-baht son-in-law of Saeng Aruna.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.040
But I’ll make all your dreams come true.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.000
Huh?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.240
What’s wrong with the photo?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.640
You don’t look handsome.

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.480
People will say

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.000
I took unflattering photos of my boyfriend.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.360
Come here.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.920
Give it to me.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.640
I’ll help take some for you.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
Do you even know how to take photos?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.800
It’s okay, I’ll teach you.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.880
Here, try this.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.080
Hold it like this.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.479
Like this?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.400
Just aim right here.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.960
Okay.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.880
If the background is bright,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.240
the photo will be overexposed.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.800
Do you get it?

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.400
How is it?

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.240
Let’s do it again.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.040
I’ll change the pose.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.680
But this time I want a cute pose.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.560
Which pose?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.080
The bear pose.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.360
Do I look handsome?

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.320
Well…

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.840
Yeah, kind of.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.600
But you’re more handsome.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.320
See?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.600
That’s not true.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.720
You’re more handsome.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.600
Look at the colors too.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.560
What?

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.079
Hey, stop arguing.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.040
I’m your tutor, okay?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.079
Such a shame, huh.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720
It’ll only be in bloom for a little while longer.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.600
Then it’ll wither.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.360
Why are you being dramatic now,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.440
you grizzly bear.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.120
I’ll just grab you with mu claw!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.360
You have successfully grabbed the doll.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.160
Please open the lid to retrieve the doll.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.800
Yes.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.720
Where?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Is the little bear in here?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720
Hello everyone!

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.560
Welcome to Midnight Sun.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.360
This is our final day on set.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.600
It doesn’t mean we’re quitting filmmaking.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.360
It means that

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.280
we’re about to wrap shooting!

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.840
Yay!

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.360
Woo!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.480
As of now,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.400
for anyone who hasn’t booked tickets for the premiere,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.760
it’s too late.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.040
But that’s okay, you can watch the replay on

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
the iQIYI app.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.240
Please give us lots of support.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.560
Oh!

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.000
Oh my gosh!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.159
Support! Woohoo!

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.840
I meant the viewers waiting to watch.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.480
Let’s move to another couple.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.000
Here’s the next pair.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.240
Honestly, this couple didn’t even have to come.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.240
But they chose to anyway.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.520
Do you want to be published online?!

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.880
Oh wow, so fierce.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.400
Hey.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.480
I’m just teasing.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.000
Ohhh.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.800
Anyway, we’d like to thank Book,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.080
the founder of E-Book,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.560
who became successful

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.960
at the youngest age in Thailand.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.360
And Mud, your follower as well.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.760
Not his follower.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.040
I’m his boyfriend.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040
Oh!

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
Oops.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.880
Whoa.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.760
Oh!

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.480
Huh?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.760
If I don’t say it like that, he’ll get mad at me.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.640
Let’s move on to the last couple.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.280
This is the hottest couple right now.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.880
Ice, the rising star,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120
and Saint, the former billionaire heir,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.400
who decided to..

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.920
Oops!

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.000
Let’s change the topic.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.640
Oh, okay, take two.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.240
Ice and Saint,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.440
the ship everyone is holding their breath for,

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.040
wondering how it’ll end.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.440
They say

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.360
young puppy boys who are still virgins are..

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.720
Very fierce and very possessive of their owners.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.520
Right?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.920
I’m not a virgin.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.200
Oh! Oh!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.800
He’s not a virgin!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.000
Woo!

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.800
Wow,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.280
if the behind-the-scenes is already this intense,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.840
imagine what it’s like in front of the camera.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.640
Seriously!

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.240
Stay tuned for the next episode of

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.640
Midnight Sun.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.200
Bye-bye!

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.240
Careful.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.480
Let me have a kiss.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.400
Lanee.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.960
Hmm?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.000
You kiss my cheek every day

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.760
until my cheeks are all wrinkled.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.840
But your cheeks are so soft.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.960
Like this.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.480
Like this.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.760
Let go or I’ll take my shoe off.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.800
Can’t you take it off like this?

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.159
We’ll fall.

00:07:59.159 --> 00:07:59.920
Huh?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.840
We won’t fall.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.560
Are you sure we won’t fall?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.440
Let go, hurry.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.400
Ah!

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.720
Ah!

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.360
Oops.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.040
Are you okay?

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.480
I’m fine.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.640
Oops.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.440
Now I'm kissing you.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.480
We’ll both get wrinkly together until we’re old.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.159
I thought you were doing something else.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.159
Why did you shower for so long?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.159
Shaving.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.040
I thought you were secretly jerking off.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.280
I’ll kick you.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.800
Help me out, will you?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.000
I’m really not good at this.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.040
Sure.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.400
Stay still.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080
You’ll bleed.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.560
I’m seriously asking.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.720
Why do you always get horny in the bathroom?

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.480
People are allowed to have weird preferences, right?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.000
And when you sleep with me at night,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.840
don’t you feel anything?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.720
At night I’m tired.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.720
I use up a lot of energy.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240
What’s wrong?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.840
Nothing.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.280
It’s just…

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.000
I think it’s not that late yet.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.040
You probably

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.920
aren’t tired.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.720
Not yet.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.680
Where is it?

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.800
This time,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.200
I want it on the bed.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.720
Awake already?

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.760
Not really.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.480
How was it just now?

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.560
Did it hurt?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It didn’t hurt,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.000
just exhausting.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.440
And I’m tired from traveling.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.920
Can I sleep a bit more?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.200
Okay,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.280
I’ll go to the bathroom first.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.680
Mm.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.480
Saint.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.760
What time is it?

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.800
Almost five.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.080
Don’t we have dinner with your family today?

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.720
Oh right.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.520
Hey, where are my pants?

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.320
Hey, give them back.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.880
Hey!

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.000
What are you doing?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.600
Another round?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.240
You’re such a pain.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.840
You’ll get it in a second.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.760
Guess you’re fully awake now.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.800
Hurry up and wash your face and brush your teeth.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.120
Your family will be waiting.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.840
Let’s go.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.240
Hey.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.920
Don’t peek.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.400
Just a little.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.400
Why are you smiling so much?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.320
Probably happy

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.680
to be having dinner with your family.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.400
Hey.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.320
Don’t stare at him like that.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.280
You’ll make him shy.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.680
I like Saint.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.560
Saint?

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.160
Yes?

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.400
What do you like to eat?

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.520
Spring rolls?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.200
Sure.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.160
Make it a big piece.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
A big one.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.240
Thank you.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.480
So

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.840
when will you invite Saint’s dad

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.280
to have dinner with us?

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.560
I want to meet him.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.320
I just got him kicked out of his house.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.280
Oh.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.440
Fathers can kick their kids out?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.520
Oh.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.240
I'll will explain later.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.840
But Dad, don’t kick me out, okay?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.560
I’m trying to prove something to my dad.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.400
That Ice and I

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600
can be happy together,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.280
even if it’s not how he planned it.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.200
Mm.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.319
But right now, I’m pretty broke.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.280
I spent all my savings buying Saeng Aruna Wong stocks.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.520
So this meal, thanks to you guys

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.520
it really saved me.

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.160
If there’s anything you want me to help with,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.640
just tell me.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.960
Yes, Mom.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.680
Mom.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.280
Hmm?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.000
Please wait a little longer.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.760
I still have a lot to prove to his father.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.800
As for you…

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.320
hang in there for me.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.440
I promise

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.320
I’ll make your dream come true.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.640
Just being able to eat with your family like this,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.120
my dream has already come true.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.840
Ice,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.080
could you give me more rice.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.120
This one never stops eating.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.160
Is it good?

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.640
Do you need anything else?

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.320
Oh.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.040
The rice is almost gone.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.400
Ice, go get some more, dear.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.920
Yes, Mom.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.920
It’s okay, I’ll get it.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.680
Okay.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.160
(1997)

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.000
Ah!

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.520
Well?

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.840
Has anything improved ever since Seen left?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.640
What are we supposed to do now?

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080
How are we supposed to live?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.880
Should I go beg on the streets

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.400
so I can feed the two of you?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.160
Never doing anything

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.440
other than yelling at his own son!

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.480
Stop talking about Narong like that!

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.880
Go upstairs and apologize to him!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.240
Go!

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.000
Go apologize right now!

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.040
Go!!

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.000
The day Seen left.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.040
I said leave!

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.640
That was the day my whole world

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.040
Shit! went to hell.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.400
Kit!

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.640
Come back here now!

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.000
Come back right now!

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.040
Kit!

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.080
Everyone in my house

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.400
went insane.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.880
Hello?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.920
Uh…

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.720
it’s me.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.560
Narong.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.520
What do you want?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.760
Calling to borrow money again?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.360
Wasn’t last time enough?

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:07.760
It's just that...

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.920
I’m really desperate right now.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.200
Just one installment, okay?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.720
Please help me.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.080
I heard your wife and kid are sick.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.720
Then who’s going to pay me back?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
Don’t call me again.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160
My wife doesn’t like it.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.560
Aah!

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.400
Narong!

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.480
Narong!

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.560
Narong!

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.160
Narong!

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.080
Why did you do this?

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.520
Why did you do this?

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.520
Why did you leave me?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.760
I can’t be alone.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.960
Get up.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.360
Narong!

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.520
Get up first.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.480
Get out!

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.280
It’s all because of you.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.800
Because of you!

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.520
Get out!

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.160
I said get out!

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.560
I don’t understand.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.920
Why does everyone still blame

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.960
Seen’s return

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.080
has brought back bad luck?

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.240
It’s almost dark.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.280
I don’t want to go home yet.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.600
Seen?

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.240
Should we run away together?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.000
Wait for me here.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.120
We're going to start a new life

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.480
in a place where no one knows us.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.160
Kit.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.040
Mom.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.120
Are you going to leave me all alone?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.240
Are you going with...

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.240
that filthy thing?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.920
Are you still in contact with him?

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.920
Why don't you listen to me, son?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.920
Don't say that, Mom.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.160
He's still part of our family, Mom.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:05.880
No.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.480
Since he caused his father’s death,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.080
he no longer deserves to be part of this family.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.920
Let me ask you directly.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.120
Between me and him,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600
who do you choose?

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.960
Why do I have to choose, Mom?

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400
I just want us to stay together.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.360
If you say that, you’re choosing him, right?

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.520
Since I have no one left…

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.360
Them..

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.840
why should I live?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.000
What am I living for?

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.720
Mom!

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.600
I’m going to die.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.480
I have to die. Mom!

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.120
I have to die.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:41.960
Don't! I have to die.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.520
I have to die. Mom, don’t!

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.440
Let go!

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.200
I have no one left!

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.320
Let go!

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:49.880
Let go!

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.920
You chose him.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.640
Let go!

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.320
Let go!

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.000
I’m sorry for being a burden.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.680
From now on, I hope you’ll be very happy.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.200
In the next life, let’s never meet again.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.720
What happened?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.520
I saw a crazy person wearing a mask,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.880
dancing, then jumping into the water to die.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.440
Seen!

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.080
Seen! Hey, calm down.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.920
Hey.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.840
Hey.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.520
Kit! Calm down!

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.680
Move, asshole!

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.200
Move!

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.120
It’s because of all of you!

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.480
Made him end up like this!

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.800
Get out!

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.240
I told you to get out!

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.680
Fuck!

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:33.480
LGBTQ+ youth are four times more

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.080
likely to contemplate suicide than their peers.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.680
This accounts for 18%

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.080
of people with diverse sexual identities.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.080
The causes include depression,

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.760
stress from stigma,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.000
and misunderstanding within society.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.960
Stop stigmatization, stop suicide.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.720
(Inspired by a true story)

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.920
(Thipthara Phuthongkham would like to thank TQB)

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.600
And that concludes

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.280
the student short film Midnight Sun.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.160
I’d like to invite the director, the cast

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.480
and crew to come up to the stage.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.480
Woo!

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.800
First, I’d like to ask a few questions

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.840
to our two lead actors.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:36.800
Saint,

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.760
I heard this is your first time acting in a film,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.720
and the role you played is

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.680
very different from who you are.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.160
Was it difficult?

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.600
Honestly,

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.040
it was quite challenging.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.920
It took some time for me to tune into the character.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.200
But if I had to say what was the hardest part,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.360
it would probably be…

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.880
the chemistry between the two of us.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.560
That was the hardest.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.600
Next, may I ask Ice a question?

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.920
Of course.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.320
Was there any scene that really made

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.120
you feel emotionally immersed?

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.560
I feel like...

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.720
The scene that felt the hardest and most intense for me

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.200
was probably the scene where Seen commits suicide.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
That scene had a very strong impact.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.400
Yes.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:24.720
Because…

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.880
maybe it’s because I personally relate to it.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.240
Ice, you’re very strong

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.160
for having gone through those experiences.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.480
Now for the final question.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.760
I heard that during filming,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.480
the actors weren’t told in advance

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.880
how the ending would turn out.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.880
Could you tell us more about that?

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.600
I can answer that.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.120
Sea said that

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.240
we used this technique

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.480
so that the emotions expressed

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.960
would align most closely with Kit’s feelings,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.440
not just the perspective of an actor who knows everything.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.960
At that time, I thought

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.720
Seen would be waiting for me by the sea.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.160
But in the end,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.840
he wasn’t there.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.560
It reminded me of a time

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.120
when I wanted to go out and find someone

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.000
I loved very much,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.560
but in the end,

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.560
I didn’t go.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.000
I think

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.320
if I hadn’t gone to help them that day,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.840
I would have regretted it deeply.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400
Let’s give them a round of applause.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.480
Lastly, I’d like to ask the director

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.480
if there’s anything you’d like to say.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.320
Well, honestly,

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.560
the film has already said everything.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.680
But what I want to say is

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.760
thank you so much to everyone.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.360
Thank you, Saint.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.719
It feels like destiny that Saint got to act with Ice.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.199
I’m happy we became close.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.080
Thank you, Ice,

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.440
a person I love dearly.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.880
And finally,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.040
the person I want to thank the most is

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.639
Lanee.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.320
Not only as an executive producer,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.400
but you are is everything to me.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.320
Without you, I don’t know

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.080
if this film would have turned out this perfect.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.200
I love Sea's film.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.600
Hello. Hello.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.160
Hello, Auntie.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.520
You're so talented.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.360
How was it?

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.400
I’ll be right back, dear.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.640
I’ll be back in a moment.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.640
Hello.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.360
Hello.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.560
You’re Mr.Khom, right?

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.360
Yes.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
I’m…

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.960
my name is Kaew, I’m Ice’s mother.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.040
Yes.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.240
Aren’t you going inside?

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.920
It’s okay.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.040
I just stopped by to watch.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.240
I’ll be leaving soon.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.720
Oh.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.080
The kids are really talented.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.480
They’ve come this far without any help from us.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.600
As a mother,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.160
I feel…

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.360
very guilty.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.320
I wish I could have helped them more.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.080
If I could turn back time,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.040
I would find a way

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.360
to stay and watch my children grow up longer.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:59.280
You shouldn’t wait until it’s too late, Mr.Khom.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.920
I’ll excuse myself now.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.440
Goodbye.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.760
(New-generation music label)

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.920
(To support the dreams of people with a past)

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Right now, Lanee, Book, and I together

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.880
hold 40% of the shares.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.440
If I get 10% from Dad,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.080
that means I’ll become the largest shareholder.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.760
And we’ll change Saeng Aruna Wong Group

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.280
into SLI Group.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.240
SLI Group, a new-generation music label,

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.520
to support the dreams of people with a past.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.320
The proposal is fucking cool.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.200
We’re not just doing music.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.640
We also plan to make films.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.960
For the film division,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.680
Sea and I will manage it together.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.280
So the missing 10%

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.280
has to come from Saint’s dad alone, right?

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.600
Can’t we get shares from other shareholders?

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.240
Getting shares from Mr.Khom

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.960
is the best and easiest option.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.760
If Mr.Khom transfers them to Saint,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160
he won’t need approval from anyone.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.520
That’s true.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.880
I plan to find a chance to talk to him

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.480
after the university countdown event.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.240
Speaking of the university countdown,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.680
I’ve already prepared all the media

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.120
that will come to promote and cover it.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640
Our stance is clear now.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.760
All that’s left is our label’s debut project,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.600
which will use the university countdown

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.400
as the first stage to introduce Ice.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.480
We’ll have to see how it goes.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.840
I believe Dad will see that

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.240
we do have a good future.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.960
And now, the performance by our talented artist,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.080
Ice Karun Thongdee, will begin in just a few minutes.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.400
Is everyone excited?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.000
Woo!

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.800
What?

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.520
Are you excited?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.600
Everyone, do exactly what we practiced.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.960
Give it your all.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.600
Three, four, Red Sunflower together.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.520
Got it. Sure.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.160
Let’s go.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.880
Three, four.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.320
Red Sunflower!

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.280
Ten?

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.840
What’s wrong with you?

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.240
I just want to know how many minutes left.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.880
How many minutes?

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.560
How many?

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.000
Two minutes.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.760
Why?

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.800
Two minutes isn’t enough.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.440
It’s here already.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.040
What’s here?

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.560
It’s right at the entrance already, everyone.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:45.240
Slippery chunks.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:45.920
Slippery chunks.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.760
Ugh.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:47.720
I don’t know what this is anymore,

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.440
I can’t wait,

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.240
I’m going.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.360
Ten!

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.160
Shit!

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:52.920
What the hell?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.280
What should we do?

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:57.880
If we think positively,

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.200
he might make it back in time.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.360
From the look of it,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.240
there’s no way it’s getting out of his intestines

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.760
within two minutes.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.160
Can we delay the performance just a little.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.800
I don’t think that’s possible.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:08.800
Huh?

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.320
We have to perform before

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.680
the New Year countdown.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.640
What’s going on?

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.560
Ten has explosive diarrhea.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.200
He probably won’t make it on stage in time.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.360
All the musicians are standing by backstage already.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.360
Can we do a sound check one more time?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:31.040
Woo!

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:35.040
How about we cut the electric guitar?

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.040
Then there won’t be a solo section.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.120
But we don’t have a choice.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.920
And now, if everyone is ready,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.080
please give a big round of applause for Ice’s band

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.960
with the song Red Sunflower.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.080
Let’s go with that.

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.920
Three people is fine.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.440
Go.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:58.440
Let’s go.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.360
Hello everyone.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.360
My name is Ice.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.800
I never imagined

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.040
I would get to see something like this in front of me.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.760
Thank you all so much.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:27.160
(I once went through pain.)

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.360
(But then you came and gathered my broken heart.)

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.400
(You healed the wounds that never faded.)

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.560
(The feeling I have when I’m with you.)

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.400
(It changed the sky that was once dark)

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.200
(into a light that made my heart beat strongly again.)

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.240
(And nobody can ever take your place)

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.520
(because love has tied our hearts together.)

00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:01.080
(I promise that every second, there is only you.)

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.360
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.120
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.000
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.480
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:18.560
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.440
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.240
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:30.960
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.240
Before the final hook ends,

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.200
I’d like to say something first.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.640
Today,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.080
I want to give credit

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.520
to the person who helped me write this song.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.160
At first,

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.200
the two of us planned to keep this a secret.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.720
But today…

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.040
I’m ready to say it out loud.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.640
That…

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.880
Saint is the co-writer of this song.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.440
Woo! (Fighting!)

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.000
Can I hear it for Saint?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.240
Woo!

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.280
Woo! (Fighting!)

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.040
And

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.840
this is also my inspiration for writing the song.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.480
When we were working on it,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.240
someone once said that

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.480
sometimes a song about a secret crush

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.880
doesn’t have to be a happy-ending song,

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.720
because not everyone

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.960
we like will like us back.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.280
But thank you, Ice,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.320
for turning your song

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.440
into a song with a happy ending.

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.560
It’s not just my song.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.560
It’s our song.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.480
(Thank you for coming into my life)

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.240
(as a ray of sunshine,)

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.720
(that gives meaning to a sunflower like me)

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:54.520
(from once withered to bloom again.)

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.480
(Thank you for making everyday)

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:01.400
(no longer lonely as it once was.)

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.240
(I'll give back with all the love in my heart.)

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:10.720
(Always Red Sunflower of yours.)

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.520
Woo!

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I can't take it anymore!

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Bye!!

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.560
Since when can you play electric guitar like that?

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.560
I’ve got a lot more surprises for you.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:15.440
Hey,

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.880
let me ask you something.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.560
If back then…

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.160
I hadn’t chosen you to play together,

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.520
or if I hadn’t agreed to be your roommate,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.440
do you think we’d still end up like this today?

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.880
I don’t know.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.400
But I think…

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.440
I’d find my way back into your life anyway.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.120
Even though you knew

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.400
I’d probably kick you out?

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.840
Mm.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.000
But still…

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.640
At least one thing is obvious, right?

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.400
I acted best in that scene.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.920
How do you know?

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.040
Wanna do another casting round?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.200
Seen.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.520
Can I do the scene where I kiss you?

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.800
You like me, don’t you?

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.000
If I ask, you have to answer.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.960
So how was the casting result?

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.480
Passed, obviously.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.680
I mean…

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.960
That scene had to be you, right?

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.520
In front of shrine?

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.000
They might be watching.

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320
But I think…

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.640
The gods are probably on our side.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.640
Hello, Aunt Bua.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.560
Hello, Saint and Ice.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.520
You’re early today.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.120
How have you been, Aunt Bua?

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.200
I’m doing well.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.480
Please come this way.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.560
Aren’t we going inside?

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.920
The Master asked you to wait here first.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.280
Aunt Bua,

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.200
since when did Dad start planting these flowers?

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.880
Or is he just messing with me?

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.760
Why don’t you try asking

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.960
Mr.Khom yourself, Saint?

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.800
Do you like these sunflowers?

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.720
Sorry?

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:22.280
At first, I planned to replant the red sunflowers.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.160
But once I actually tried,

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.480
I realized that red sunflowers

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.480
are really hard to find.

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:35.360
No wonder you two love them so much.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.200
Alright.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.600
Let’s get straight to the point.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.480
You probably know

00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.080
why I called you here.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.480
To be honest,

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.400
I really have no idea, sir.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960
Are you serious about Saint?

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.160
Yes.

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.840
No matter what happens,

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.640
you won’t leave him,

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.320
you won’t make him sad.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440
Yes.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.120
No matter if he’s sick or poor,

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:20.000
or in another ten years,

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.800
when he’s old and completely useless,

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.800
I still won’t leave him.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.120
But right now, I am poor though.

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.280
I heard you went around buying up company shares.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.400
Is that true?

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.520
Yes.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.320
As for the remaining ten percent of the shares,

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.040
I’ve decided

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.280
to give them to you.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.360
From now on,

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.200
you’ll be the major shareholder

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.160
of Saeng Aruna Wong Group.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.200
As for you,

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.200
I’m sorry,

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.560
I scolded you a lot before.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.560
I had Benz take photos of you two

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.240
because I wanted to know

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.400
how you were doing

00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.120
after you left the house.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.760
I tried going to therapy.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:30.000
That’s when I realized

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.520
that I was actually

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.600
the one who was abnormal.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.920
You know, Saint,

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.920
when I tried

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.200
music therapy,

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.920
the sound I heard,

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.960
the sound of my hand hitting the drum,

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.640
was the same sound

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.400
as when I slapped you.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.840
I’m sorry, Saint,

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.040
for filling our memories

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.760
with nothing but bad things.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.520
Everyone has gone through bad times.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.680
Please don’t blame yourself, sir.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.360
This might sound selfish,

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.280
but if you don’t mind an old man

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.080
with a wicked heart like me,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.200
this house is always open

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.080
for you to come back and live here together.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.680
Alright?

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.280
Saint,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.760
you know this, right?

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.600
This house has always been in your name.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:51.040
All this time,

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.840
he has been like the sunflowers in the garden.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.360
Whenever someone rang the doorbell,

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.480
he’d always look out, every single day,

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.000
waiting for the day you’d come home.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.200
Saint.

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.320
I missed you too.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.080
I'm sorry.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.440
I miss you.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.440
One.

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.160
Two.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.880
Three.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.240
Yay!

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240
The shop is open!

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:51.920
We’re open!

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.280
Hurry up!

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:53.880
They’re here!

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.120
They’re here now!

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.160
Saint and Ice’s photobook,

00:56:57.160 --> 00:57:00.000
with exclusive behind-the-scenes content,

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.640
from the two of us and Benz.

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:03.920
Besides those,

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.640
there’s also a lot of merchandise.

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.760
Come pick yours first!

00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.000
You can scan here.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.360
Scan right here.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
This one?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.040
Scan over here. That one?

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.800
Ah, the car’s here!

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.600
Hey!

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.680
Everyone, please stay calm!

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.840
Not yet, please!

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:49.320
Calm down!

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.800
Move aside.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.560
What do you mean?

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.880
It’s me, you idiot.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.040
Oh.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.240
Is there ever going to be a first day of school

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.640
that's not hectic?

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.160
Ice, can I take a selfie with you?

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.760
I really like you.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:05.960
Woo!

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.400
Could you tone it down a bit?

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.320
See, his partner is standing right there watching.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.640
Uh…

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.800
Sorry.

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.600
Sorry, I’m just kidding.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760
I’ll take the photo for you.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:19.720
Thank you.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.480
Hey, did you hear

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:27.800
they’ve known each other since they were kids?

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.080
They’re such a perfect match.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.600
For real.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.880
Saint, the president of SLI Group,

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:34.360
and Ice, the rising male artist.

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.760
And Ice even tutored Saint

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.520
until he got into university.

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.680
Oh my god!

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.040
That’s amazing.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.960
So cute.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.400
A perfect golden couple.

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.280
They call that qīng méi zhú mǎ.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:58.040
I’ll excuse myself now.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.400
Please make way.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.400
Excuse me.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.960
(High-Security Prison Café)

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880
How does it feel

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.560
to see so much attention on SLI Group?

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.000
I’m really happy that SLI Group

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.200
has finally launched officially.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:44.760
Yes.

00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:47.400
And now that you’ve debuted Ice Karun Thongdee

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.800
as your first artist,

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.480
can you tell us

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.800
if there are plans for a second artist yet?

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.720
Yes, there is.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.200
Ice personally picked

00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.720
and is grooming this one himself.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.200
Can you give us a hint who it is?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.320
How do you sell the coffee?

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.640
How have you been?

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.720
Just like you see.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.560
I’m like any other inmate.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.200
Are you training for a job at the café?

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.160
Yeah.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:34.840
Oh.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:39.640
This is probably what I like most.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.920
I want to apologize to you, Ice.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.720
For losing control

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.640
and doing terrible things back then.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:51.560
At the time, I only thought about

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.840
wanting to feel like I’d won.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.480
It was really stupid.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.360
Since when did you start doing drugs?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.200
Why?

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.640
I never knew.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880
I use it when I’m stressed.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.360
Sometimes I don’t know

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.800
who to talk to.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:25.960
Warm.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.200
Actually, I wasn’t a good partner either.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.680
I’m sorry.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.280
But you know, right, Warm,

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.240
that you really were my warmth once.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.040
I just want to tell you that

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760
I forgive you now.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.760
And I hope

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.640
you can forgive me too.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.160
Yeah.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.120
I’m sorry too.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.360
Yeah.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.640
So…

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.320
have you thought

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.480
about what you’ll do after you get out?

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760
Do you still want to be a singer?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
No one’s going to give me a chance.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.040
Hey.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.520
But don’t pity me.

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.320
This is what I deserve.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.080
Opportunities

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.200
come from not repeating your mistakes.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.000
Then come stay with us.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.760
Saint, our friends, and I

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.760
started a company together.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.080
Huh?

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.360
Just like you saw in the news.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.920
SLI Group is a music label

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.640
created to support people

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.800
with dreams who have a past.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080
What do you mean?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.800
It means if you truly change,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.920
don’t be afraid that

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.160
no one will give you a chance.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.120
We’re ready to give you one to

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.480
become a singer.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:28.920
When you get out,

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.840
if the song’s ready,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.400
don’t forget to audition at my label.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.720
Yeah.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.560
If you’re brave, then hit me.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.600
I'm kicking you out!

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.560
If you’re brave.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.800
I’m not scared.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.280
I can be scared.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.080
Come!

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.640
If you’re brave, hit me.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.200
Go ahead and try.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.560
Charge!

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.400
Yay, I won!

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.920
This place is really nice.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.920
It’s beautiful and peaceful.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.720
Then come visit often.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.400
Now that we’re family,

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.720
just message me anytime.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Everyone,

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.200
let’s take a photo together.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:35.440
Make me look handsome, Saint.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.440
Of course.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.160
Hurry.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.440
Come on, Dad.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.440
Go! Come on.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.120
You should join too, Dad.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.480
How can a family photo not include you?

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.960
Come on, Dad.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.240
Stand right here.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.720
Uncle, smile big.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.240
Family photos need big smiles.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.360
Alright.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.200
Here we go.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I’m exhausted.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:59.720
Let me eat something.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.520
Can I take a photo?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.160
Sure.
