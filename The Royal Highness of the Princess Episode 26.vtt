00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.359
I never expected

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.120
that the Map of the Nine Provinces

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.519
was actually a scheme by Emperor Yunze.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.120
There's no such treasure map to rule the world.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.159
Everything,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.840
is just a trick of human nature.

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:01.519
My father learned

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.000
what happened during the Heaven-Worship Ceremony.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.560
He realized he had

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319
misjudged the Chief Grand Secretary's intentions.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.959
These past few days,

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.759
he's been locking himself in his study, full of regret.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.479
Right, speaking of which,

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:13.719
thanks to you that day,

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:14.879
otherwise, Yuwen Rui

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.039
definitely wouldn't have

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.840
taken the token so easily.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.400
It's rare (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:20.159
that you were willing to trust him.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.159
Yinglu told me a bit

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.639
about what you encountered on your southern trip.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.879
Lord Yuwen stepped forward to protect the people.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.759
It shows he's a trustworthy and good official.

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:34.360
Besides, he was your choice.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.919
Your judgment can't be that bad, right?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.800
Since you praise me so sincerely,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.599
I'll graciously accept your compliments.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.919
To return the favor,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240
I should praise you too.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.599
Wearing this official robe,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.080
you truly stand unparalleled in the world,

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.240
matchless under heaven.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.080
Of course.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.080
My brother is peerlessly elegant.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.280
He looks good in anything.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.319
Someone's in a very good mood today.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.879
Is it because you're going to see your sweetheart?

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.879
What sweetheart?

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.240
I just came to see you today.

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.360
I have official duties to attend to.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.520
I'll visit you another day.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.800
Alan.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.319
Is the Fourth Princess doing alright?

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:36.639
My elder sister recently

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.599
has been helping Father with various state affairs.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.719
On the surface, she seems fine,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.719
but I know

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.120
her heart must be in great pain.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.479
Tell me,

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.120
why couldn't Su Qi just be Yuwen Xiu?

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:57.680
Fifth Princess,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.560
you sent for me?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.000
It's not me looking for you.

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.800
I guessed

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.639
that someone came to the palace

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.120
to see their sweetheart.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.759
This...

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.120
Alan,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.279
what are you talking about?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.560
Why are you so flustered?

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.680
I wasn't talking about you.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.439
Alright.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.879
I need to go see my elder sister.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:32.240
I'll leave this place for your "world for two."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.480
What "world for two"?

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.240
Thank you, Fifth Princess.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:50.800
I was busy the past few days,

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.240
so I didn't come to find you.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:53.839
I made you worry.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.959
Who's worried about you?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.639
Were you injured that day?

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:05.560
Just a minor injury.

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:06.639
It's fine now.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.240
Let me see.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.439
In a few days,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.279
I will go to the Meng residence to propose.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.279
Is that alright?

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:16.720
Who...

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:19.279
Who said I'd marry you?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.480
A new mission already?

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.319
Save Grand Tutor Guan.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:53.120
It's your final mission.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.879
You can go back.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.399
Alan.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.800
Alan.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.600
What's wrong?

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.439
You mean you're leaving?

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:40.319
Never coming back?

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.360
All of this is a world from a storybook,

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.319
and you're returning to your own world.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.759
You're acting quite convincingly,

00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:10.680
but you still can't fool me.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.120
I'm not lying to you.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.639
Think carefully.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:23.680
How did I know Grand Tutor Guan would take his own life?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.560
And Commander He,

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.360
Little Li, and the others?

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.840
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:36.720
Let's go.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.279
Hongyi.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.039
Can you help me with something?

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.679
You... you...

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.000
He...

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.240
He's the "drama"

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.879
spirit you mentioned?

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.279
At this point,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.200
you two

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:23.559
should say your goodbyes properly.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.080
So it's true.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.519
You really don't belong to this world.

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:45.759
You really don't belong here.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.720
It's okay.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.600
I'll find a way to make you stay.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.039
Father, Mother,

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:20.279
I've come to see you.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.000
But this time, I'm not alone.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.279
Alan is my beloved.

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:42.120
I originally planned to bring her after our wedding,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.080
but I thought

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
you must be eager

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.480
to meet her.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.919
She will be my one and only wife.

00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:28.080
I will protect her for the rest of her life.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.360
Alan,

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:38.720
would you be willing to call them Father and Mother?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.360
Father.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.440
Mother.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440
May Father and Mother in heaven

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.519
bless Alan and me

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.440
to grow old together in this life.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.320
Being so handsome,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.080
I should have looked at you more before.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.080
You still can in the future.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.240
Don't frown so much.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.480
I told you,

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:21.600
I will find a way.

00:13:32.559 --> 00:13:33.240
If...

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.360
if I do leave,

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:42.799
you be well,

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:50.559
alright?

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:53.799
Alright.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.120
After two or three years,

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:12.159
just forget about me.

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:15.720
Alright.

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:20.200
Then find a girl you love,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.759
and get married.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:29.519
Don't overthink things.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.039
Get some rest early.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.720
I've prepared some things.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.960
They're in the room we stayed in before.

00:14:55.919 --> 00:14:59.480
There are letters inside for Father and my elder sister.

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:03.559
And also some gifts for Shaojue,

00:15:04.159 --> 00:15:05.000
Yinglu,

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:06.600
Xixi,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200
and Little Li Zi and the others.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.679
If I...

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.720
Please help me deliver them.

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:26.480
Alright.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.319
Yuwen Rui.

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:47.920
What's wrong?

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.200
A Lan.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.519
A Lan, tell me.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:55.480
What must I do...

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.559
for you to not leave?

00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:58.720
Tell me.

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.559
I have no choice.

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:02.200
I have no choice.

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:03.680
I lied to you.

00:18:05.079 --> 00:18:06.039
If you leave,

00:18:06.839 --> 00:18:08.960
how could I possibly live well?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.920
No, you must live well. How could I...

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.599
How could I ever forget you?

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.960
And how could I ever marry and have children?

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:15.640
No.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.359
You...

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.240
How could I... A Lan...

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.160
Tell me.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.960
What should I do?

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.720
A Lan.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.720
Don't make me worry.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.200
Alright?

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.480
I once said,

00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:28.359
in this lifetime of mine,

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:32.200
I only wish to grow old with you alone.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.400
I only wish for you.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:02.279
What's wrong?

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:08.039
Chief Grand Secretary is overwhelmed with grief,

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:08.920
hence the blood he coughed up.

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:10.440
Your Highness, please don't worry too much.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.200
Imperial Physician Chen.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.720
May I have a word in private?

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:35.400
Your Highness.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.319
What further instructions do you have?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.400
Physician Chen, do you know...

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.400
if there is any medicine that can make one forget...

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.640
the one they love in their heart?

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:50.240
Your Highness...

00:19:50.599 --> 00:19:51.640
What do you need this medicine for?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.079
It's nothing.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.400
This is the prescription I've written for Chief Grand Secretary.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.799
Take it for two days and he'll be fine.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.160
Then this humble official will take his leave.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.200
It's today.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.839
After I leave this place,

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.759
what will happen here?

00:20:36.759 --> 00:20:37.559
You will leave...

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.279
in a manner that appears to be an accident.

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.640
Perhaps as time passes,

00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:46.599
everyone will slowly forget you.

00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:51.960
He won't.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.599
Fifth Princess.

00:20:59.279 --> 00:20:59.799
Physician Chen.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:01.200
Your Highness.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.519
This humble official...

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.240
...did not tell you the truth earlier.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.759
What do you mean?

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:16.680
This is the elixir Your Highness wanted.

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:22.559
Didn't you just say...

00:21:23.119 --> 00:21:24.200
you didn't know of such a medicine?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.799
Your Highness, please forgive me.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.240
This humble official did not intend to deceive you.

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:32.279
It's just that this Heart-Severing Pill...

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.319
is the only one in the world.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:36.799
I originally intended to give it to my...

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.480
elderly mentor who just lost his beloved wife.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.920
But I just received tragic news.

00:21:42.559 --> 00:21:45.319
My master has already passed away.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.000
So this medicine is for you, Your Highness.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.119
You're awake.

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.000
I've prepared medicine for you.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.319
Drink it while it's hot.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.559
A Lan?

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.559
What is it?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.599
Yuwen Rui?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.839
Why is the Fifth Princess here?

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.519
I...

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.559
This official does not wish to see the Fifth Princess.

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:34.200
Please show some self-respect.

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:41.960
I...

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.920
I'll leave now.

00:24:50.319 --> 00:24:50.759
Wait.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.880
Regarding my marriage engagement with the Fifth Princess...

00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:00.720
I must ask the Fifth Princess...

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.119
to find a way to cancel it as soon as possible.

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:10.920
Alright.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.960
Physician Chen.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:49.799
My lord.

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:50.599
What further instructions do you have?

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:55.519
Please trouble yourself to give this to the Fifth Princess.

00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:58.480
Tell her this is the medicine she was seeking.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.640
Letting you leave with peace of mind...

00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:52.079
is the only thing I can do for you.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.359
An Ran.

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.079
An Ran.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.759
An Ran.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:01.880
An Ran.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.079
You're finally awake!

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.680
What happened to me?

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.359
Don't you remember?

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:18.440
I was scared to death.

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:19.920
On the day you were playing An Kelan,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.119
a ladder fell on the set.

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:22.640
Both you and President Ling passed out.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.759
It scared me so much.

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.039
Ling Rui also passed out?

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.279
He should be in this hospital too.

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.119
I wonder if he's woken up yet.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.400
An Ran?

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:36.519
Thank goodness you shielded him.

00:29:37.079 --> 00:29:37.559
Otherwise,

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.000
he'd definitely have a big hole smashed in him.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.200
Be careful!

00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:55.720
Could he be like me too?

00:29:58.039 --> 00:29:58.920
Which room is he in?

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.599
Can you take me there?

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:07.920
An Ran!

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:09.759
Why are you looking for him?

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:11.160
An Ran!

00:30:11.599 --> 00:30:13.000
An Ran, why are you walking so fast?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.440
An Ran!

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.000
Why are you in such a hurry to find him?

00:30:44.119 --> 00:30:44.519
Yu...

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:02.599
You are...

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.640
I...

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.319
President Ling.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.960
She's from our crew,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.599
the actress playing An Kelan, An Ran.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:10.839
She was the one who saved you on set earlier...

00:31:10.839 --> 00:31:11.359
I'm sorry.

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:12.400
I have something urgent.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.240
If there's anything, you can contact the production team.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.200
Anran

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.759
What's wrong?

00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:39.039
As I thought.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.119
It was just a dream.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.440
Wh-what?

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.000
Let's go.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.720
Let's head back first.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.640
Here, take it slow.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.400
Don't move.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.599
My girlfriend is so beautiful.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.359
Our engagement was decreed by the late Empress Dowager.

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:40.799
It wasn't by our mutual consent.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.400
I know you don't want to marry me.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.599
Anyway,

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720
you'll definitely find a way

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.519
to cancel the engagement.

00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.799
A'Lan likes her elder cousin.

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:52.359
Don't cancel the engagement.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.119
Does the Fifth Princess not know

00:32:58.359 --> 00:32:59.319
that seeing a woman's bare feet

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:01.039
means one must marry her?

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.039
You saw them, sir.

00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:04.359
Do you intend to marry me now?

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:18.359
Sharing a snowfall together,

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:20.640
I wish to grow old with you.

00:33:22.559 --> 00:33:23.000
A'Lan.

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:27.119
Would you spend your life with me, till our hair turns white?

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:32.240
Two one nine.

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:33.440
Five six one.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.920
Seven eight two.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.799
Two-one-nine means page two of the love letter collection,

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:38.880
the ninth character of the first line.

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:41.200
The whole string of numbers is...

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.519
Is what?

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.200
I love you.

00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.680
If you leave,

00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:00.400
how could I possibly be okay?

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.000
How could I ever forget you?

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.279
How could I ever marry and have children?

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.039
For my entire life,

00:34:07.119 --> 00:34:09.960
I only wish to grow old with you alone.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.400
Hey, bro, wake up.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.480
The actress playing An Kelan,

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.159
which room is she in?

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.360
Room 406.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.519
You know she saved...

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:30.679
Sweetheart.

00:34:31.119 --> 00:34:33.199
Are you sure you don't want to stay a couple more days for observation?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.159
Didn't the doctor say I'm fine?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:35.920
I can be discharged.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.199
Alright.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.880
Then I'll take you back to the hotel first.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.480
Then I'll head to the set.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.519
Our show...

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.639
Do you know how it ends?

00:34:59.280 --> 00:34:59.880
Don't even mention it.

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:00.840
Almost everyone dies.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:02.400
By the way,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760
do you know who

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.800
the biggest villain in our show is?

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.280
The male lead, Yuwen Xiu.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.639
He's actually Su Qi, the prince of the enemy state.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.239
Su Qi kills the Emperor of Yunmi,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.199
and destroys Yunmi.

00:35:14.719 --> 00:35:16.000
Then the female lead, An Kezi,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.280
dies in the war

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.559
protecting her country.

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:20.719
Two people who clearly love each other,

00:35:21.239 --> 00:35:23.360
yet never confess their feelings before they die.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.800
It's very different from the dream.

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:38.559
Later,

00:35:39.039 --> 00:35:40.039
Su Qi becomes emperor.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.440
He seems to have gained everything,

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:43.079
but he's actually a pitiful man.

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.719
The person in his heart

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.599
will never return.

00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:47.960
His entire life,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.639
is spent in regret and remorse.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.360
Forget it.

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:01.119
Let's not talk about this.

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:02.960
You go back and get some proper rest.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.880
I'll go back and pack up,

00:36:06.119 --> 00:36:07.639
then come find you at the set later.

00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:08.559
Okay.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.360
I'll have someone buy some grapes you like.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.159
Let's go.

00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:48.039
Xiao Wang, bring that prop over.

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:48.960
Okay.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.400
Put it here.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.039
Be careful.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.480
It's quite heavy.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.519
Food's here! Food's here!

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.360
Come on, let's eat.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.119
Let's go, let's go, go.

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:05.599
Go.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.559
It's you.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.599
Isn't it?

00:38:54.719 --> 00:38:55.280
It's me.

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:57.639
I've remembered everything.
