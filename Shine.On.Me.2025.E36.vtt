Come on.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.392
Look.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.380
These

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.361
are all our achievements.

Dr. Lin.

00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:13.461
Getting off work?

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.101
Yeah, Taiji.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.481
I'm off to the kindergarten.

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:20.040
So your daughter

00:15:20.201 --> 00:15:21.400
is still in kindergarten.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.621
So you had a daughter later in life.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.461
Thanks for the comment.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:30.981
Taiji.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400
Get off work early.

00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:33.621
Thank you.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.660
I will get off work on time.

00:15:36.241 --> 00:15:38.260
Robots never work overtime.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.260
Goodbye.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.040
Dr. Lin.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.621
Hello, Doctor.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.560
I'm happy to see you on time.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.621
According to the itinerary,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.180
(Signing Ceremony)
you're heading to

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.101
Sunshine Kindergarten

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.461
to pick up your daughter.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.501
After dinner with her,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.321
you'll head to the airport

00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:11.081
for your wife.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.540
Her flight

00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:14.201
will arrive at 7:30 PM,

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.520
landing on time

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.380
at Shanghai Pudong
International Airport.

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:19.581
Are there any changes

00:16:19.581 --> 00:16:20.800
to the above itinerary?

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.701
No.

00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:24.201
(Signing Ceremony)
Do you wish to replay

00:16:24.341 --> 00:16:25.660
the news you've played

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:26.920
ten times this morning?

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.060
Alright.

00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:32.680

(It further solidifies)

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.560

Guang Yu Photovoltaic has)

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.121
(not only advanced)

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.821
(in traditional PV modules,)

00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:54.640
(but also expanded)

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.420

- Bye.
- Bye.

00:17:18.641 --> 00:17:19.241
Bye.

Dad.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.241
(Xingheng)
Are we going to

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.721
pick up Mommy?

00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.401
Yes, Xingheng.

00:17:25.681 --> 00:17:26.401
After dinner,

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.741
we'll pick up Mommy.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.981
Say goodbye to your friends.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.620
Bye, Lin.

00:17:31.712 --> 00:17:32.360
Say goodbye.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.340
Bye, Xingheng.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:33.888
Okay.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.168
Let's go.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.661
Dad, I won't eat.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.401
I want to see Mom sooner.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.800
She is still on the plane.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.221
I can't really make

00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:45.320
the plane fly faster.

00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:46.881
Plus, if she

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:47.560
finds out that

00:17:47.641 --> 00:17:48.340
we don't eat,

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.260
I'll lose points.

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:50.921
Thanks to you,

00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:51.941
I have very few

00:17:51.941 --> 00:17:52.461
points left.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.280
I never told on you.

00:17:58.496 --> 00:17:59.800
(Sunshine Kindergarten)
Two days ago, you told Mommy

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.800
that I didn't

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.641
braid your hair.

00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:02.860
I lost five points.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.201
This morning, you told Mommy

00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:07.921
I watched the rocket launch
instead of watching cartoons with you.

00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:09.060
I lost another five points.

00:18:09.701 --> 00:18:10.901
Daddy's points are all gone.

00:18:10.941 --> 00:18:11.481
Xingheng.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:14.080
Mom is strict.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.120
My teacher only deducts
one point each time.

00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:19.560
So we need to behave

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.860
and eat, okay?

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.141
Okay.

00:18:22.721 --> 00:18:24.860
I will tell Mommy

00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:26.221
that you're the best

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.520
and ask for your points back.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.201
Thank you.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.100
Let me check again.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.741
Now Mommy won't

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:48.201
find anything to criticize.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.481
Mommy's here.

♪I only remember

You're finally back.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.540
Great job.

00:19:25.641 --> 00:19:26.981
It's been a long time.

♪Like the dialogue of an old movie♪

- What's wrong?
- Be good.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.201
Mommy.

00:19:40.961 --> 00:19:41.481

00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:44.100
There are flowers!

Welcome home, Mommy.

00:19:47.381 --> 00:19:49.141
Thank you, Xingheng.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.520
Daddy took me to buy them,

00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.161
but I used my pocket money.

00:19:57.141 --> 00:19:58.780
Daddy's so stingy.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.760
Good thing Mommy only brought

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.100
chocolate for you.

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.320
No chocolate for Daddy.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.600
Mommy's the best.

00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:13.080
Did you miss Mommy?

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.001
Xingheng.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.060
Auntie wants a hug. Come on.

00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:21.161
Auntie, flowers.

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.376
Wishing you success from the start,

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:27.241
and victory wherever you go.

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:28.860
Sweetie.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.941
Auntie loves you so much.

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:32.992
You even know such difficult idioms.

00:20:32.992 --> 00:20:34.201
You're amazing.

00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:36.201
Xingheng,

00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:38.600
don't go back with Mommy and Daddy.

00:20:38.944 --> 00:20:40.780
Stay with Auntie
in Shanghai for a few days.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.760
Did you bring chocolate?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.280
Of course, I did.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.320
I also bought

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.360
other yummy things.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.780
I'll finish what Mommy brought first,

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.241
and then go to your house.

00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.501
Little smarty-pants.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:56.960
Yusen.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.040
I'm so happy

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.540
your clinical applications
of the brain-computer interface

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.540
are a huge success.

00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.300
It will help

00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:03.501
paralyzed patients

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.881
regain independence.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.961
I saw the news before I left.

00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:07.961
I just got too busy

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.340
to congratulate you in time.

00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:10.441
You're amazing.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.296
Thanks.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.201
It's the achievements of our colleagues

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.620
from various specialties.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.721
Will it soon be possible

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.181
to restore sight to the blind?

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.481
In current clinical trials,

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.681
higher-density electrodes

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.860
already help the blind

00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:25.260
perceive the three primary colors.

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.461
Not only us,

00:21:26.641 --> 00:21:28.360
but many other research teams

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.401
are working on it.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.540
That's great.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.421
I'm grateful to be born in this era.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.221
And I need to

00:21:35.401 --> 00:21:36.241
report something.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.040
While in Saudi Arabia,

00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:39.320
your wife kept searching

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.421
for your news,

00:21:40.741 --> 00:21:42.040

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.221
Got a problem?

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.780
I was keeping up with cutting-edge tech.

00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:49.856
What a coincidence.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.481
I also played the news about

in the Middle East on loop.

00:21:58.001 --> 00:22:00.141
You can drop the "you guys" part.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.540
I know it wasn't about me.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.981
I knew you'd

00:22:07.981 --> 00:22:09.620
come to pick up Xiguang.

00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:11.001
I also called someone

00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:12.120
to pick me up.

00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:13.580
Where is he?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.280
Sheng Xingle.

00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:22.580
I am back.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.600
Where are you?

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.568
Mommy will cook for you.

00:22:25.568 --> 00:22:27.120
- What?
- You can't find fault, huh?

00:22:27.141 --> 00:22:28.421
Ten more minutes?

00:22:29.152 --> 00:22:30.560
You're done for, Sheng Xingle.

00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:31.820
Your esports team

00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:33.141
won't get another penny

00:22:33.241 --> 00:22:34.780
from me this year.

00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:39.901
Once Xingle is here,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.080
let's have dinner.

00:22:41.481 --> 00:22:42.100
Forget it.

00:22:42.741 --> 00:22:44.181
You're going back to Suzhou.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.020
Besides, absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.941
I don't want to be a third wheel.

00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:51.421
Where is your car?

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.360
At P2.

00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:54.721
Different floor.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.441
Here's your baby.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.941
Daddy braided your hair?

00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:03.901
What is it?

00:23:06.912 --> 00:23:08.100
Xingheng.

00:23:08.128 --> 00:23:09.681
Take one for now.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.320
I'll give you the other one

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.719
when you come to my house.

00:23:14.784 --> 00:23:16.064
Say thank you.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.344
Thank you, Auntie.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.392
You're welcome.

00:23:23.392 --> 00:23:24.160
Take care.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.380
The company car is here.

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.920
Take the company car back.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.900
Got it, Boss. Don't worry.

00:23:31.059 --> 00:23:31.940
We know the way.

00:23:32.319 --> 00:23:33.680
It's been a long trip.

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:34.680
Stay home

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.880
for the next few days.

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:36.920
Come back on Monday.

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:37.839
Paid holiday.

00:23:38.819 --> 00:23:39.700
You're the best.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.220
Let's go.

00:23:41.599 --> 00:23:42.839
Stop being a third wheel.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.799
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.480
We're off now.

00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:47.420
Take care.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.539
Okay, let's go.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.940
Let's go home.

00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:51.807
Let's go.

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:53.400
Off we go.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.799
You used

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:58.579
four hair clips?

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.259
What's wrong?

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:00.480
You should use six.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.720
The more, the better?

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:02.900
Points for you.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.871
Okay.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.640
Off we go.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.400
I saw her before boarding.

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.519
Right in front of us.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:21.099
I thought you'd

00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:21.900
say hello.

00:24:24.019 --> 00:24:24.980
No need.

00:24:29.339 --> 00:24:30.759
I remember years ago,

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.539
when you, Kevin, and I

00:24:33.599 --> 00:24:35.180
left Hua Ya to start our own venture.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.420
After securing

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.099
our first FOF,

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.940
we celebrated.

00:24:39.559 --> 00:24:40.279
And you got drunk

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:42.480
and told me your story with her.

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:43.519
Just that once.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.319
But I remember it clearly.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.259
You said you wanted

00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:50.799
to tell her you were sorry.

00:24:53.079 --> 00:24:53.940
Not disturbing her

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:56.440
is the best apology now.

00:24:58.819 --> 00:25:00.119
Success forgives the intrusion.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.591
Chris,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.500
she's not like that.

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.559
This is human nature.

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.220
She can be an exception.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.259
You struggled

00:25:14.259 --> 00:25:15.299
the whole trip?

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:17.059
No.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.119
I actually slept

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:23.740
on the plane.

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:26.579
Soundly.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.339
I dreamed about the past.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.259
But seriously,

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.579
you haven't seen her

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.920
all these years?

00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:41.920
That's weird.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.339
Didn't you alumni get married?

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:44.859
You didn't run into her?

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:48.140
Maybe

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:51.039
it's taken back.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.059
What do you mean?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.920
Why didn't you wait for me?

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.200
My suitcase

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.259
came out just now.

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:02.539
What's wrong?

00:26:03.424 --> 00:26:04.160
Oh.

00:26:05.099 --> 00:26:05.839
Isn't he

00:26:06.119 --> 00:26:07.119
my never-met

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.880
life-saver?

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:10.839
You still remember him after a decade.

00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:11.960
Come on.

00:26:12.759 --> 00:26:13.460
He didn't

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:14.859
let me thank him in person,

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.160
but at least

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:17.079
I remember his name.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.380
Besides,

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.700
he's now China's

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.759
preeminent figure

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.144
in brain-computer interface

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:23.900
and brain science research.

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:25.740
I work in investment.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.079
Of course,

00:26:28.339 --> 00:26:29.059
I would know him.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.240
My life-saver

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.960
truly stands tall.

00:26:34.339 --> 00:26:35.059
Impressive.

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:39.079
Is that his wife?

00:26:41.819 --> 00:26:42.539
Why does it look

00:26:42.839 --> 00:26:43.859
a bit familiar?

00:26:47.299 --> 00:26:48.359
But I can't recall.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.460
Because you had amnesia.

00:26:51.339 --> 00:26:52.063
Let's go.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.240
I lost my memory at Changbai Mountains.

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:01.279
That was a decade ago.

00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:02.299
How did I know her?

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.299
You did see her there.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:05.619
Seriously?

00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:09.480
I remember now.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.039
She's the head of Guang Yu.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.619
That explains it.

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.779
She's married to Dr. Lin?

00:27:16.779 --> 00:27:18.160
How did that happen?

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.740
They kept it a secret.

00:27:20.223 --> 00:27:20.880
No one knows

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.519
they're married.

00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:23.400
They're impressive.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920
When I first met her

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.220
at Changbai Mountains,

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:26.859
I only

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.339
found her pretty.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.980
But now,

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:31.539
she's become

00:27:31.539 --> 00:27:32.720
a big name in new energy.

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:33.343
Chris,

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.019
you're amazing too.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.119
Of course.

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:37.680
I'm a partner at Sequence Quant,

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:38.440
after all.

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:39.539
Alright,

00:27:39.539 --> 00:27:40.579
excellent Ms. Chris,

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:42.619
what's for dinner?

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.920
I'm dying for Chinese food.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.619
You guys go ahead.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.539
I need to comfort

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:49.359
my poor boyfriend

00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.420
who got stood up

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.299
twice.

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:54.339
Traitor.

00:28:13.152 --> 00:28:16.832
♪I can only call out loud♪

00:28:16.832 --> 00:28:21.184
♪To mask my awkward sorrow♪

00:28:21.664 --> 00:28:24.256
♪Clutching regret tightly in both hands♪

00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:28.352
♪Tossing it
towards the dazzling fireworks♪

00:28:28.352 --> 00:28:31.104
♪Even if love was so brief♪

00:28:31.104 --> 00:28:36.128
♪Wishing you well
is the kindness I choose♪

00:28:36.672 --> 00:28:42.816
♪You're not coming back♪

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.799
Three pieces a day.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.160
You can only have one a day
if you eat it daily.

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:55.359
And brush your teeth.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.240
But Mom bought so much.

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:00.460
It'll go bad if I eat too slowly.

00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:03.779
I promise it won't go bad.

00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:05.184
Or I'll pay for it.

00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:06.359
Mommy.

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:10.119
Even though I bought it,

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:12.240
I'm only responsible for buying it.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.460
Daddy distributes it.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.660
And you eat it.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:16.119
Our roles are clear, right?

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.000
One piece a day is too little.

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:21.119
I can't even taste the flavor.

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:27.743
Sweetie.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:28.779
Well...

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.200
Mommy needs to brush her teeth

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400
and put on a face mask.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.660
So, discuss it with Dad.

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:36.460
Dad,

00:29:36.759 --> 00:29:38.619
I want three pieces.

00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:41.740
That is too much.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.259
Your teeth will go bad.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.140
I won't be friends with you.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.000
Then,

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.039
how about two pieces per day?

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:49.819
- Okay.
- We...

00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:50.359
Okay.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:51.940
Pinky promise then.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.319
Okay, sealed.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.099
Okay, it's settled then.

00:29:58.859 --> 00:29:59.359
Sleep.

00:30:00.019 --> 00:30:00.607
Come on.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:39.980
She's asleep?

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:45.940
Yeah.

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:48.359
We bargained for ages

00:30:48.539 --> 00:30:49.900
and agreed on two pieces a day.

00:30:50.279 --> 00:30:51.160
She agreed to sleep.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.140
You sure ran off quickly,

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.980
leaving me to deal with her.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.819
I'm too soft-hearted.

00:30:59.099 --> 00:31:00.200
An important task like

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.019
distributing snacks

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.279
shall be entrusted

00:31:02.299 --> 00:31:03.839
to the nutrition expert,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.700
Dr. Lin.

00:31:08.579 --> 00:31:09.559
A kiss as a reward.

00:31:12.299 --> 00:31:12.920
Is the reward

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.980
just symbolic?

00:31:33.376 --> 00:31:34.420
I'll take her to her room.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.599

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.740
Just a little.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.539
But I slept a bit

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.480
on the plane.

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:37.359
And now,

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:39.440
I'm a bit too awake.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.579

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:50.980

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:51.980

You've realized that vision.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.740

Swordfish wontons.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:20.920
Your mom had someone

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.099
deliver

00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:23.119
some wontons yesterday.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.139
Mom is busier

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:26.880
than any of us now.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:28.500
She's always traveling all over,

00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:29.300
never around.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.760
I remember that

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.119
you encouraged her

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.380
to go around in her sixties.

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:37.980
Because she's much happier

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:39.559
when she's busy.

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.159
She does look

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:43.880
more energetic.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:44.863
I'll cook them.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.599
Okay.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.780
In a few minutes,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.900
Xingheng will wake up too.

00:34:59.659 --> 00:35:01.340
Did you say something

00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:03.340
before bed last night?

00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:06.579
Something about realizing a vision?

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:07.699
Yeah.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.039
Congratulations

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.659
on selling your products

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:12.420
to the Middle East

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.440
and building BIPV power systems

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:16.239
in the deserts of the Oil Kingdom.

00:35:18.719 --> 00:35:19.800
(What else did I say?)

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:22.039
You also said

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.599
that you'd sell the products

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:24.760
to the Middle East

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.420
and build massive BIPV power systems

00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:29.400
in the deserts of the Oil Kingdom.

00:35:29.559 --> 00:35:30.920
All "Made in China".

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.039
When did I

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:34.059
say those things?

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:36.340
You said in a previous meeting

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.360
not to limit our focus
to the markets of Europe and America,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.380
but also pay attention

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.179
to Asian,

00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:43.099
Latin American, and African countries.

00:35:43.559 --> 00:35:44.480
So I thought about it.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.199
As you always talk
about the Northwest strategy,

00:35:47.599 --> 00:35:49.400
the Middle East is also full of deserts

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.559
with intense sunlight,
perfect for such projects.

00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:53.699
I found a pattern

00:35:53.739 --> 00:35:55.039
and generalized.

00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:55.800
I attributed

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.960
such wise words

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.820
to you.

00:35:58.019 --> 00:35:59.079
Aren't you pleased?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.099
You still remember that nonsense

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:05.980
so long ago?

00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:09.599
Of course, I remember what my wife says.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880
What if you quiz me?

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.360
Don't talk nonsense.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.719
Have I ever quizzed you?

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:19.940
You made it.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.659
So it wasn't nonsense.

00:36:22.739 --> 00:36:23.579
Young Miss Nie

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:25.139
was ambitious

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.159
and insightful.

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:32.059
And you too.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.360
You made it, Dr. Lin.

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:37.179
(Medical education)

00:36:38.199 --> 00:36:39.360
reaches far beyond the clinic

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.880
and the operating room.

00:36:44.179 --> 00:36:45.239
I can do many things.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.500
There is always

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.260
a different path.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.380
There are things to do.

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:56.519
My hand is ruined.

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:58.059
Without it,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.059
I am useless?

00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:02.460
My knowledge

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.400
is the most valuable.

00:37:09.639 --> 00:37:11.800
Mom, Dad, good morning.

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.159
Is there anything to eat? I'm hungry.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.679
You got up by yourself.

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:18.000
You're amazing.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.019
Look.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.920
Daddy is making wontons.

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:22.619
The ones that Grandma sent.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.559
Almost ready.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.460
I want the kind Great-Grandma makes.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.980
With fried eggs in the soup.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:31.460
Okay, Mommy will make eggs.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.159
Go to Daddy.

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:33.215
Come on.

00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:36.019
How many do you want?

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:36.703
One?

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.739
One and a half.

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:38.847
Okay.

00:37:39.199 --> 00:37:39.880
How many for you?

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.179
Two.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.739
Then I'll have one and a half too.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:46.179
Xingheng.

00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:48.440
What does that add up to?

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:50.639
Five.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.260
You are so smart.

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:54.800
So clever.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:56.991
Come on.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.000
Daddy, your name has

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.619
five "woods" in it.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.280
You even figured that out?

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.400
It does have a lot of "woods".

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.579
She's improved so much.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:07.280
She can

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.360
write all our names

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.280
very beautifully.

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:10.360
Really?

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:12.960
Mommy's name is really hard to write.

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:14.659
Really, I can write it.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.440
Let me show you.

00:38:16.659 --> 00:38:17.400
Okay.

(Nie Xiguang, Lin Yusen)

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:10.335
Yusen,

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.639
do you remember

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.219
that when we

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:16.000
first started dating,

00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:17.960
you sent me a WeChat message,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.900
saying your name lacked sunlight

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:22.016
with too much "wood"

00:39:22.539 --> 00:39:23.900
and asked me to bring you light?

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:30.199
Did I?

00:39:31.059 --> 00:39:32.119
Yes, you did.
