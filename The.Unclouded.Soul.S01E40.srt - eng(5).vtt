[The Unclouded Soul]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 40]

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.280
Demon King,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.200
our two duels

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.310
were both interrupted halfway.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.350
This time,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.910
no one will be able to stop us.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.190
Those three strikes just now

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.910
were for Ao Hen,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.800
Qiong Qi,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:13.840
and Teng She.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.450
Back in the Realm of Mist and Void,

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.760
if it weren't for you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.800
and Xiao Yao,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.800
Pianpian, Tan'er, and I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.990
wouldn't have made it out alive.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.970
Consider those three strikes

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.380
as repayment for that debt of gratitude.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.120
Now that the debt is settled

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.230
and the mirror fragments are complete,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.970
it's time for me to take everything back.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.079
Dream on.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.880
I'm alive again?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.480
I've regained my physical form.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.920
Bingzhu!

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.920
I'm Tan'er!

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.680
I'm Tan'er!

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.600
Bingzhu!

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.560
I'm Tan'er!

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.390
Bingzhu!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.830
Bingzhu!

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.430
Stop fighting!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Stop it, now!

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.870
Pianpian?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.430
Pianpian!

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.360
Xiao Yao!

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.920
Xiao Yao.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.159
I'm Tan'er.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.830
I'm in Pianpian's body!

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.040
I really am Tan'er!

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.480
The demon-slaying blade!

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.940
The demon-slaying blade!

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.240
Xiao Yao,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.270
we've got to make them stop fighting.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.730
Let's stop them together.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.070
Watch out behind you!

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.790
Who would've thought that
after the Immortal Lord and Tan'er

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.830
merged into one, you'd actually be
less formidable than before?

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.600
Trading you for the Kunlun Mirror

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.130
isn't too much to ask, is it?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.430
Xiao Yao!

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.270
Xiao Yao.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.800
Xiao Mu.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.430
Xiao Mu!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.190
Xiao Mu.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.630
Xiao Mu!

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.390
You two, stop it now!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.000
Stop fighting!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.600
Bingzhu!

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.600
Please stop!

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:18.800
Stop fighting!

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.070
Xiao Yao?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240
Pianpian?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.030
Pianpian.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.840
Xiao Yao.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.440
Hong Ye.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.670
Xiao Mu!

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.570
Don't move.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.150
-Stay still!
-My Lord...

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.120
My Lord.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.120
Please don't be sad, My Lord.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.080
Even if I, Xiao Mu, am gone,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.910
Xiao Ming will still be by your side.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.440
Xiao Ming,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.720
we've only got one life left.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.320
Use it wisely, will you?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.150
Xiao Mu!

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.450
Don't move.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.120
My Lord.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.510
Xiao Ming

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.480
is in your care now.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.500
You'll be alright.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.270
Xiao Mu!

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.150
Xiao Mu?

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.480
Xiao Mu.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.960
My Lord,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.600
Xiao Mu is gone.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.240
My Lord,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.030
from now on,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.630
it'll be just me, Xiao Ming,
staying by your side.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.360
My Lord...

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.080
My Lord!

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.600
Pianpian.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.200
What exactly...

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.150
I am Tan'er.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:43.750
You...

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.350
Bingzhu, I really am Tan'er.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.800
What are you talking about?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.240
General.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.700
I don't want fine clothes,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.370
I don't want a house,

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.010
and I don't want a husband.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.440
All I want is for you to become

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.500
that happy, carefree Bingzhu again.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.400
Bingzhu,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.270
with your martial skills,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:07.870
after you join the army,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.870
you'll surely become a great general.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.910
Consider this money

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.120
a loan from me.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.750
When you become a general,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.550
you'd better pay me back double.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.630
Once I become a general,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.840
I'll buy you the finest clothes, Tan'er.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.080
Mm!

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.810
We'll live in the finest house.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.880
And when the time comes,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.440
I'll also find you

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.970
the most virtuous husband.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.390
Bingzhu.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.630
I don't want a husband.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.830
Having you is enough.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.910
You...

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.390
So you're really Tan'er?

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.510
In truth, many times
when I do not leave my sheath,

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.310
it isn't entirely out of my will.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.440
It's because you yourself also know

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.290
that the demon before us

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.120
is not truly wicked—

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.720
you just don't want to admit it.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.000
Tan'er.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.120
So what about Pianpian?

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.320
Where is she?

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.200
When I woke up,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.080
I was already in Pianpian's body,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.080
and my soul had been fully restored.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.100
But I couldn't sense her presence at all.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.270
My last wish

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.800
is for you and Tan'er

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.030
to be

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.960
reunited

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.620
as brother and sister.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.720
I want

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.870
to see Tan'er one more time.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.320
As long as I find the Yuli Spring,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.000
everything will be alright.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.790
Just wait for me.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.080
I cannot...

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.510
Wait any longer...

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:45.320
Bingzhu.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.750
It was Pianpian who saved me.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:13:59.910
Bingzhu.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.960
Let's go home.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.040
Let's go home.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:17.630
Tan'er...

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:22.360
Let's go home.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.160
Let's go home.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.480
Aging,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.040
sickness,

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.200
and death

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.020
—the three mirror fragments,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.750
as well as

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.860
the fate of both demons

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.550
and humans alike—

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.750
I'll leave it all to you.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.120
In this life,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.670
I will atone for my sins

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.120
in my own way.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.030
Neither the wealth and splendor
of the human realm

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.690
nor the blissful immortality
of the Yuli Spring

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.560
has anything to do with us anymore.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.040
I hope you'll keep your word.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.600
Xiao Yao.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.200

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.670
Only by dissolving the millennia
of suffering amassed within it

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.440
♪ Moon shifts stars, wind stirs
curtains at the window ♪

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.810
and allowing every soul
to let go of its obsessions

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.240
♪ Waiting only for a glance
from you in this lifetime ♪

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.500
will the Kunlun Mirror truly disappear.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.270
Join me.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.440
It's been 10,000 years,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.580
yet nothing has changed here.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.930
I remember everything now.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.920
Ten thousand years ago,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.850
I lived one lifetime as a human prince.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.320
Drifting on a boat at sea,

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.410
the noodles in that fishing village,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.970
the bone flute you gave me,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.000
and our wedding in the desert...

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.110
Xiao Yao,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:14.510
I took advantage of you.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.110
I'm sorry.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.400
After 10,000 years,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.980
the debt between us

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.190
has already been repaid.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.070
You're too naive.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.530
The Kunlun Mirror can never be destroyed.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.750
Whether human or demon,

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.160
there's always desire—

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.240
coveting what's not meant to be theirs.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.480
Desire stirs conflict in the world,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.350
keeping it in perpetual turmoil.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.720
A world ruled by desire

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.920
is easier to control.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.490
The Yuli Spring is an ocean
where the deities gather desire,

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.020
and the Kunlun Mirror is the conduit
through which that desire flows.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.820
Since it cannot be destroyed,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.270
we can co-exist with it.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.640
If I seal the Kunlun Mirror
within my body

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.110
and then seal myself away—

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.470
neither living nor dead,

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.170
never dispersing, never perishing—

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.480
the Yuli Spring will cease to exist
in this world.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.060
You cannot.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.030
All of this began because of me.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.010
Now, it can only be repaid by me as well.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.920
Hong Ye!

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.830

Today,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.160
we're testing transformation techniques.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.440
Those who fail

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.100
will have to stay after class.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.850
Little Dragon Girl.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:02.280
You go first.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.440
Did you collect hair

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.100
from teachers and friends
you're familiar with

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.000
as I asked?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.290
My bed collapsed again.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.040
Betroth your second cousin to me
as my new bed.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.880
Such impudence.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.840
No respect for elders at all!

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
But your imitation of that fool

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.460
was remarkably accurate.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:46.590
Remember—

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.440
practice diligently,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.960
and never grow arrogant or complacent.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.310
Mm.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.320
You may go.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.640
Little Dragon Girl:

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.920
top grade.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.310
Teacher,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.920
you've eaten so much again.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.520
Please tell us more stories.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:25.350
Sure.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.110
Where did I leave off last time?

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.400
-Last time...
-Last time,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.160
you were telling us about
destroying the Qionghua Sect.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.550
That's right.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:32.030
Where?

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.160
-Destroying the Qionghua Sect.
-Yes.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.920
Teacher, what's wrong?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.590
Teacher?

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.880
Teacher?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.750
What's wrong?

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.770
This...

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.000
Teacher

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.240
must have been reminded of

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.310
that tragic love story.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.510
Let's not talk about it.
Let's skip this part.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.480
The Realm of Mist and Void.
The Realm of Mist and Void instead.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.000
Let's not talk about that.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.310
You want to know about
the Realm of Mist and Void?

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.000
Yes.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.860
That Realm of Mist and Void

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.200
is a small island in the sea

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.850
guarded by spirits.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960
Normally, neither humans nor demons

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.030
can find the entrance to that realm.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.420
It was only because of my good luck
that I,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.280
along with Dali, the most beautiful
goddess of Demons' Valley,

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.000
obtained a painting together

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.800
and finally found the entrance.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.750
Teacher, so who is Dali?

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.840
Teacher?

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.960
Teacher?

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.000
Teacher?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.160
Let's focus on the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.240
Only the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.240
-Teacher.
-Teacher.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.030
Let's not talk about that.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:42.750
Let's focus on the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:43.480
Please stop crying, Teacher.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.070
Teacher.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.530
Just tell us about
the Realm of Mist and Void.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.830
Teacher.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.570
Where were we just now?

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.560
Xiao Ming.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.310
Look.

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.520
While I was gone,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.760
you let the Demons' Valley
turn into this mess.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.680
The minor demons aren't focusing on
their cultivation

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.480
and only know how to play around.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.510
The way Bamboo and Luoluo teach

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.030
is also terrible.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.740
It's really unbearable to watch.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.030
Enough!

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.350
Stop nagging.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.270
What can I do about it?

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.550
Each generation of demons
has their own ideas.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:28.480
Just let them be.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.640
We can't just let things drift.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.890
You need to supervise them properly.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.530
The minor demons
who just achieved human form

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.190
only admire the prosperity of
the human realm.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.930
Well, you're wrong about that.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.550
The human realm today

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.550
is very different from the past.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.000
It's not as dangerous as before.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.440
Going there to gain some experience

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.700
wouldn't be a bad idea.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.830
Going there to gain some experience

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.480
wouldn't be a bad idea...

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.350
yet I still haven't learned to speak
the way you do.
