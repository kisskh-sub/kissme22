WEBVTT

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:43.960
Erni

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:46.399
If we go by what others think,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm nowhere near as good as Bai Yuchen.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.359
Why do you always hang out with me?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799
Is now the right time to take advantage of me?

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.240
With this old, salty tofu of yours,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.679
I'm worried I won't even digest it.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:59.799
You want to ask

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.159
why I took a liking to you?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.319
This is the reason.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.599
Xiao Qing

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.400
We've asked you out so many times, but you never show.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.959
I need to go home and do my homework.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:23.680
What homework?

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.079
We brothers never went to school.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.319
Come with us for a little tutoring.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.840
I'm not going.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.280
You...

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.840
Let go of me!

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.760
A bunch of Steel Mill trash!

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.239
Daring to bully someone from our Old Street!

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.120
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.519
Still wet behind the ears, trying to play the hero?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.719
Old Street

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.519
is under my, Zhao Fengsheng's, cover.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.519
You cover it?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.799
That piece of land, Old Street,

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.359
our Steel Mill has its eyes on it.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.439
You little brat,

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.319
can you really cover it?

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:54.879
Let's go.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:55.640
Think you can leave?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.759
Trying to run?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.919
I'll kill you, kid!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520
I'll smash you!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.599
I'll smash...

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.400
I'll smash you!

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.199
I'll smash you!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.439
I'll smash all of you!

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:27.919
Go, go!

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.919
Smash you all!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080
Are you okay?

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.080
This is nothing.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.599
If anything happens in the future, call your brother.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.199
I'll cover you.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.960
Is your injury okay?

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.199
It's fine.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.960
So I've been handsome since I was a kid, huh?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.240
Do you even understand romance?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.599
You completely ruined the good mood.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.120
It's fine.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.240
No, no, no.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.560
Don't move.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.280
It's dangerous.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.639
Do you even know how to ride?

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.400
If not, I'll do it.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.280
Da Gang's junker only has foot brakes.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.639
It wears out shoes too fast.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.319
I'll do it, I'll do it.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.680
Hold on tight!

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.960
Okay.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.120
Let's go.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.199
Be careful.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.080
Pretty impressive, right?

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.240
So impressive!

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.319
Not bad at all.

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.879
Everyone can relax now, right?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.360
The banners are already hung up.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.960
Old Street's Admission ceremony has to be this dignified.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.719
Alright.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:52.439
Shengzi.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.639
I heard from Erni

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.680
you pretended to be a janitor

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.879
and solved the whole thing.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.560
You really do have the most clever ideas.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.759
Don't listen to her nonsense.

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.240
I didn't pretend to be any janitor.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.199
Don't worry.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.960
Brother knows you care about face.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960
I won't tell anyone else.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800
Our Old Street is really going to be Admitted.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.479
Old Buddha said it himself.

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.319
Could it be false?

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.400
Auntie Wang even has the gifts ready.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.599
This old woman of mine,

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.479
doesn't know how to do anything.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.199
Can only manage a bit of handiwork

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.360
to express my thanks.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.480
No need to be so polite.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.879
Today's problems are all solved.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:20.959
We're all still one family.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:21.759
Right, don't stand on ceremony.

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:22.360
Where is everyone?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.079
Manager Bai

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.519
Such a grand occasion.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.360
Manager Bai

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.879
I've prepared a gift for you.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.279
Really?

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.319
You're too kind.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.240
Too kind.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.199
Manager Bai

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.279
I've brought something for you too.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.959
To show my gratitude.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.199
Manager Bai

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.000
This old woman thanks you.

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.399
What's going on?

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.160
They seem to be thanking Bai Yuchen.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.519
Everyone, this...

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:47.319
Put it over there.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:47.879
Over there.

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.800
Put it over here by me.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.279
Come on, come on.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.360
This guy's addicted to stealing credit.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.160
Let's go deal with him.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:55.600
Everyone is being too polite.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.759
Too polite.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.079
You're all too kind.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.879
As for me,

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.680
I merely

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.079
did a little bit of insignificant work.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.920
If you want to thank anyone,

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.560
thank the Qian Group's

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.639
Miss Qian and Chairman Qian.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.279
Alright?

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.759
Good!

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.399
Good!

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:08.120
Yuchen,

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.680
Don't be so modest.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.360
You're Old Street's great benefactor.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.160
I dare not, I dare not.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.519
You're not just our benefactor,

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:16.279
you're also Old Street's son-in-law.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.680
Right, right, right.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.839
That Guiying,

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.160
gave birth to a fine girl.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.079
Otherwise,

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:24.279
how could we have connected with Manager Bai

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.839
and the Qian Group?

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:27.600
Isn't that right?

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.000
Makes sense, makes sense.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.279
This is from your auntie,

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.720
a "Mandarin Ducks Playing in Water" embroidery for you.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.439
I wish for you

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:36.920
and Manager Bai "a hundred years of happiness."

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.600
Here, take it.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.040
No, no, no.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.759
No, I can't.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.240
She's shy.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.759
Thank you.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.399
Mom, what are you doing?

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.920
Auntie Wang,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.079
that's very thoughtful.

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:46.439
Everyone, please don't be so formal.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.639
Just call me Yuchen from now on.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.399
Just Yuchen is fine.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.079
Alright.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.800
Auntie Wang,

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.480
You can't just play matchmaker like that.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.920
Also, Old Street's admission

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.199
was all thanks to Shengzi.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.399
Shengzi went to the Qian Group to secure it.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.079
Right?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.319
He...

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.240
Shengzi,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.439
quickly tell everyone.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.519
Was it you who brought the Qian Group people here?

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.360
I promise everyone,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.079
yesterday, Chairman Qian

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:08.240
personally discussed Old Street's admission with me.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.879
You...

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.439
That's right.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.000
Don't you dare lie to the neighbors here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.639
Okay?

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.439
What?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.160
What you all don't know is,

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.920
yesterday, our Chairman Qian

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.720
canceled all appointments to meet an important guest.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.560
All appointments were canceled.

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:22.439
Even the matter of Old Street's admission

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.879
was something I submitted a report on

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.040
and passed up.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.839
Thank you, thank you.

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:28.639
Zhao Fengsheng,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.160
do you have anything else to say?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.240
The person Chairman Qian met yesterday

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.480
was me.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.399
It was a brother of mine.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.160
You...

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.920
You say Chairman Qian canceled all appointments

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:40.399
just to see you?

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:41.040
Right?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.519
Yes.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.319
Look at what you are.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.879
Our Yuchen

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.160
needs an appointment

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.360
to see Chairman Qian.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.399
You, this little punk,

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.399
think Chairman Qian would personally receive you?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360
Alright, alright.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.079
Now's not the time to argue.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:58.160
Hurry up and get the ceremony ready

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.800
to welcome the Qian Group leaders.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.319
Okay.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:01.199
Hurry, hurry.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.639
Make some more preparations.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:08.000
Alright, alright.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.319
None of you believe me, right?

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:10.439
Just wait, I'll show you all

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.920
who's the one full of lies.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.680
The Qian Group is here!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.879
The Qian Group is here!

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.800
The Qian Group is here!

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.959
Go welcome them quickly!

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:24.680
President Qian!

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.959
Careful.

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:27.839
I'll do it.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.399
Neighbors!

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.399
These two

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:34.920
are from our Qian Group:

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.519
Miss Tianyu and Mr. Chen.

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.199
Welcome!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.600
Welcome, welcome!

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.439
Welcome, welcome!

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.639
Miss Tianyu, Mr. Chen,

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.839
welcome! Welcome!

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.279
This woman is also a person in charge?

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.560
She wouldn't come here to cause trouble on purpose, would she?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.040
What's there to fear?

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:52.720
The head of the Qian family already agreed.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.079
She's just a young girl.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.040
What can she do?

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.000
Tianyu.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:56.959
Yaqing.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:57.680
I'm here.

00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:58.600
Go ahead.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.439
Go, go, go

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.399
What's the meaning of this?

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.120
If we let the Qian Group

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.519
know Old Street has a human trafficker,

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.720
what if they don't let us join?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.160
One bad apple spoils the whole barrel?

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.600
Exactly.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.000
Uncle,

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.639
that's a bit harsh.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.720
Thank you, Qian Group,

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.839
for letting our Old Street

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.160
join the Chinese Association.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.240
Thank you both for coming.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.079
Please, have a seat.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.199
Since

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.240
the Qian Group agreed to Old Street's admission,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.679
they naturally see your development potential.

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:36.919
After Old Street joins,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.879
you won't need to pay any profit share.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:41.480
Really?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.519
Not even ten percent?

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.559
What's going on?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.799
This is fantastic news!

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.759
What a great deal!

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.679
Brother Chen,

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:53.080
how come they don't even want a profit share?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.159
Miss,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.440
the day Mr. Zhao met with Chairman Qian,

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.519
the Chairman personally ordered

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.320
the waiver of Old Street's admission fee.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.000
Who did you say met with my father?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.639
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.559
Mr. Zhao.

00:09:08.039 --> 00:09:10.240
That jerk snuck into Haihu Yuan yesterday.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.720
What on earth did he say to my father?

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.200
This... this is wonderful!

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.159
Thank you, Bai Yuchen and President Qian!

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:19.840
Yuchen,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.600
you were too modest before.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.759
You have so much say

00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:24.519
within the Qian Group.

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:27.159
You're probably going to be Vice President.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.159
No, no.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.519
The Qian Group has never done this before.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.639
Did these Old Street folks really

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.799
hit the jackpot?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.200
Thank you, Qian Group,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.120
for giving our Old Street such a big discount.

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.200
Thank you.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.679
Thank you, Manager Bai, for your help.

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:43.399
No, no.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.720
It's my duty.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
Thank you, President Qian.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.679
Thank you, Manager Bai.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.360
Thank you, thank you.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.639
Erni,

00:09:52.639 --> 00:09:54.240
Now you see it clearly, right?

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.840
Leave that good-for-nothing Zhao Fengsheng now.

00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.039
Only Manager Bai

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.159
is right for you.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:09:59.960
Um,

00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.360
let me say something.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.840
Our Old Street joining

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.080
was negotiated by Shengzi himself with Chairman Qian.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.000
Are you all kissing up to the wrong person?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.759
Gangzi,

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:11.320
I know you and Zhao Fengsheng are good brothers.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.440
You want to speak up for him.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.960
But look at what day it is today.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.720
Zhao Fengsheng,

00:10:15.919 --> 00:10:17.279
before President Qian arrived,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.919
you could brag all you wanted.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.559
If you have the guts,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.759
then today,

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:24.759
in front of everyone and President Qian,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.679
dare you say it again?

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:28.639
Why wouldn't I dare?

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:30.240
Brother Chen,

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.159
you were there yesterday.

00:10:31.159 --> 00:10:32.200
Tell them

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.120
how I negotiated

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.960
with Chairman Qian yesterday.
