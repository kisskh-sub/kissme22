=Light of Dawn=

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.680
Let's eat, Dad.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.910
So this is how the Penghai empire

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.630
was built.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.590
Feifei,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.710
you can't

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.150
deny (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.120
my entire past

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.960
with a few videotapes.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.960
These were

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.520
business tactics at that time.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.030
When did you find out

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.120
my mom was still alive?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.030
The day we went to the police station.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.360
They showed me the surveillance footage.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.560
I recognized her right away.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.750
So all this time,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.360
you had every chance
to tell me the truth,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.240
but you chose to lie instead.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.310
Is lying really that easy for you?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.150
How do you make lies sound so real?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.840
What I told you,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.030
how I said it, and when I said it,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.630
I had my reasons.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.520
Tell me this.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.960
When you spoke to Gao Feng,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.520
which part of it was true?

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.120
You took me to the care center
to see those women.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.840
You said it was for Penglai,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.470
for justice, and for me.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.310
Which of those was true?

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.560
Every Thursday night, when you locked
yourself in the study listening to music,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.960
did you ever ask yourself
what you'd actually done?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.590
I'm talking to you. Answer me.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.910
It hurt me

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.430
when I set that fire.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.240
When I left the police station

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.030
and realized she was still alive,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.590
I was miserable.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.750
You saw what she kept

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.000
in the attic.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.360
After all these years,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.310
she was still that stubborn.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.680
She clung to her obsession.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.360
But did she ever take care of you?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.040
It was me. I played
both mother and father

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.600
and raised you.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.750
It was me alone.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.720
Those years at the club

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.480
were memories your mom and I shared.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.560
But she wanted...

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.560
She wanted a reckoning.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.560
She wanted to put an end to it.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.510
For me,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.270
those years were
fate pushing us forward.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.870
Not everything needs a reckoning.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.190
Penglai wasn't built

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.000
on a few videotapes.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.800
I didn't have it easy.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.480
I can't let everything we have
be destroyed

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.070
because of her stubbornness.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.750
If setting that fire

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.120
was what it took
to keep the Penglai Group alive,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.070
then

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.800
I had to do it.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.480
Penglai again.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.630
Everything you say

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.270
comes back to Penglai!

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.390
Then what about my family?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.070
You tell me, what about my home?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.070
Tonight, Gao Feng and I will
be waiting for you at Muke Club.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.720
I want you to tell me

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.430
the whole truth.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.240
I want a home without lies.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.120
I want a father who speaks honestly.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.120
I'll wait for your decision.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.300
=Episode 12=
=Choose=

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.870
Do I look like her?

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.270
Do I look like my mom?

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.580
You were there
when the fire happened, weren't you?

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800
Do we look alike?

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.270
I guess not.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.160
If we did look alike,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.750
if she saw me as her daughter,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.270
she wouldn't have been so cruel.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.870
Do you still envy

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.480
this perfect family now?

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.920
It's ten.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.870
Wait.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.680
Forget it.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.260
Let's wait a little longer.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm late.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.160
Feifei, do you want me to talk here

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.270
or at the police station?

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.700
(Su Min)

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.970
What are you doing?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.550
If my dad hadn't shown up tonight,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.550
I would've told you

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.510
everything I know.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.030
But he's here.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.670
So I'm giving him another chance.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.390
You still trust him?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.510
He's my dad.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.030
That golden ball of yours

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.270
isn't that important.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.320
My dad will hand over

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.750
all the evidence he has

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.270
to the police.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.390
Right, Dad?

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.320
Yes.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.670
You gave me your word, didn't you?

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.550
I did.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.320
I'm sorry.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.080
This is where

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.360
we should end things.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.960
Wu Feifei, don't do this.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.080
Let's go, Dad.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.240
Wu Feifei, don't do this.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.910
Thank you, Gao Feng.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.440
But I'm not like my mom.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.670
I'm not as righteous as you think.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.080
I don't want to be a hero.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.120
You misjudged me.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.150
I just want to keep my family safe.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.790
He's my only family.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.080
Did you find it?

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.980
(Special Informed Consent)

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.140
(Gao Feng)

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.380
(History of the Peloponnesian War)

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.870
This belongs to your mom.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.270
What you do with it

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.150
is up to you.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.840
Doctor!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.120
Doctor!

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:10.910
Feifei.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.960
What did you mean by "another chance"?

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.720
I need to know

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.600
what you didn't tell Gao Feng.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.720
The people who came to the club

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.120
were powerful.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.200
Mr. Xu planned to use the recordings

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.390
as leverage for future dealings.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.390
This is the darkest side of the club.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.440
And Gao Feng's mother
stepped right into this.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.080
They wanted to report it
using those tapes.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.510
Mr. Xu had no choice.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.480
Those people were too powerful.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:51.840
I didn't want you involved

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.000
because

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.600
it was dangerous.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.480
So everything was done by Mr. Xu?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.840
I want to hear you say it.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.840
Tell me you were dragged into this,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.870
weren't you?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.320
From now on, I'll be honest with you.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.750
Very well.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.630
From now on,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.240
our family is a separate matter

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.630
from Mr. Xu and the company.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.080
I'll take care of everything
from here on out.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.910
Once the tapes and documents

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.960
are handed over,

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.720
the past is settled.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.080
Whatever compensation Gao Feng deserves,
whatever turmoil the company faces,

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.790
we'll deal with it head-on.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.670
Also,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.200
remember this, Dad.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.750
You knew nothing

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.840
about anything Mr. Xu did.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.910
It has nothing to do with our family.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:06.790
No.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.630
If this comes out,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.390
you'll be accused of covering up.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.240
Your mom's case

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.480
is involved as well.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.270
And Gao Feng

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.200
is on our tail.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.120
I'm not scared of them.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.200
What I'm scared of
is that once I tell the truth,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.910
you'll act on impulse.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.790
You're my dad.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.000
As long as I can protect you,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.390
I'd even sell off the company.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.910
But I need you

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.480
to protect this family the way I do.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.600
Can you do that?

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.480
Alright.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.790
Then it's settled.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.240
It's time to change the tubes.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.120
Okay.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.600
Feifei.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.960
I'll tell you a secret.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.510
The reason why I kept all this from you

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.480
wasn't that I was afraid of
getting caught.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.840
I was afraid

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.030
you'd think I was a bad guy.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.390
I see.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.440
I'm your daughter.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.270
No one wants you to be a good man

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.720
more than I do.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.900
(Early 1990s)

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.160
Don't start the round yet.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.400
Wait till I get back.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.030
Serve, my foot.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.720
They're wary of me.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.030
I don't even know where they're staying.

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.270
Obviously, there's something
they don't want me to know.

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.830
Whatever.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.270
As long as the hush money
is good enough.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.480
Alright. I'm hanging up.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.240
I'll play with you guys later.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.160
Bye.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.440
Biao.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.070
Nanny Gao, sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.490
Diapers and everything are in the back.
Get them yourself.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.920
Biao, I'll have to trouble you again.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.100
This. Alcohol, gauze, painkillers,
and the rest of the list.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.920
Bring them over as soon as possible.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.270
Why didn't you say it all at once?

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.680
Sorry for the trouble.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.830
Why do you need all this?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.000
Alcohol.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.480
Gauze...

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.750
Take this. Go play cards.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.790
You'll get lucky.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.750
I'll be here in half an hour.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.440
Hurry back.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.680
Alcohol, vitamin, gauze.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.510
Where's the meds? Did you get it?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:17.720
He's buying it now.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.880
Get me that big towel.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.550
Hurry.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.310
Oh my goodness.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.350
Oh my goodness.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.240
The maid's pregnant too.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.440
No wonder you wouldn't let me in.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.350
Long time no see.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.200
Whose kid is it?

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.000
Didn't I already pay you?

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.390
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.070
Things are different now.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.000
You'll have to pay more.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.830
How much do you want?

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.510
Fine. Name your price.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.880
I'll pay you to shut you up for good.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.310
I'll take the car.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:29.240
And

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.240
give me one hundred thousand in cash.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.110
Alright.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.480
That little brat's worth that much?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.590
He's Mr. Zhao's.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.480
Think it through.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.960
If the club ever goes under,

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.070
keeping Mr. Zhao's child

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.000
means you and I both have a way out.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.880
So,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.350
are you in?

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.270
I need to take another look.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.790
He's that Yang fellow's. right?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.160
I forgot to tell you.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.480
Your man was brought in by me.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.270
Two hundred thousand.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.440
Two hundred thousand.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.440
Cash. Now.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.350
I'll pay you in installments.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.510
No. Right now.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.950
Where do you expect me to get
two hundred thousand in cash right now?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.920
That's not my problem.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.200
You don't have it,

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:02.640
do you?

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.880
Fine.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.440
Mr. Xu.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.720
Mr. Wu.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.440
They'll definitely have it.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.440
Maybe I'll pull off something big.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.400
You're asking for death!

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.550
You're dead when Mr. Wu gets back!

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.200
The baby in your belly
isn't even Mr. Wu's, right?

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.480
Zhang Biao's dead. How are you
going to explain that to Mr. Wu?

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.160
Don't worry.
I've got a way to deal with him.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.000
Who is it?

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.270
It's me.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.440
Gao Dahua.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.200
Come in.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.590
Sit.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:03.550
Thank you.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.880
Is your baby alright?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.790
Mr. Wu's kid

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:18.480
is tough.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.590
I've been taking care of Qu Meng lately.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.750
About the money we agreed on...

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.000
Don't worry.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.270
I won't short you.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.310
I don't want it anymore.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.920
I don't want the money.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.400
I'll count it as earning
some good karma.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.880
Gao Dahua,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.200
you and your wife never had kids.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:04.920
That's why

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.550
I need to earn karma.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.310
These days,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.640
having you cook

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.350
and look after Qu Meng

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.590
wasn't just for that.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.000
We've been watching you.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.880
You're a good man.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.070
Keeping this child

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.440
is trouble for us.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.550
If

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:38.400
you're willing...

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.070
Yes, I am.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.350
I am.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.200
We'll give the child to you.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:51.830
Can you look after him well?

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.680
I can.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.990
I can take good care of him.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.510
Think carefully. This child

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.200
won't be easy.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.160
I'll raise him as my own.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.480
I swear I will.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.550
Do you want to take one last look?

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:36.350
No.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.880
We won't be able to let go then.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.240
Go.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:09.750
Don't be sad.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.240
You're a mother now.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.000
You're incredible.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.510
You really are.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:22.880
Ms. Hong.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.030
You're the incredible one.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.160
Qu Meng.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.920
You're ruthless indeed.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.960
Your son is ruthless too.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.960
This is the karma you planted?

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.480
Ruthless indeed.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.880
(Let the past be the past.)

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.180
(Detention Area. Binchuan City
No. 1 Detention Center)

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.110
Dawg.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.240
Mine?

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.340
(Detention Area. Binchuan City
No. 1 Detention Center)

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:12.000
Who?

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.000
That woman found in the attic fire

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.480
was Wu Feifei's birth mother,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.750
Hongyue.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.350
My mother's death

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.220
was tied to the sex trade
at the International Club

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.480
back in the 1990s.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.720
Wu Guohao told me

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.400
my mother's name was Qu Meng.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.960
He knew her.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.790
He knew everything
that happened back then.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.350
He set the fire

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.310
to cover up evidence

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.480
and every trace of
Wu Feifei's birth mother.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.110
This may involve criminal activity
linked to the International Club.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.510
Wu Feifei

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.400
chose to shield her dad.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.720
Do you have any proof?

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.590
No.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.550
Only statements.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.350
The woman in the fire
can't be my mother.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:08.200
Well.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.750
This case is wide open now
and has drawn a lot of public attention.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.920
We can't overlook any lead.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.030
So we need both of you
to cooperate with the investigation.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.400
We will cooperate.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.640
If the company committed

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.400
any illegal or improper acts
in the past,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.690
we will fully cooperate
with the investigation.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.960
That's our responsibility.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.960
You've already looked
into the International Club.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.680
My dad was questioned as well.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.480
If you still have doubts,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.720
you're free to keep investigating.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.790
I will grant you access
to all company documents.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.030
If you find anything,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.920
the company will
take legal responsibility.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.480
But if you claim

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.750
my dad was involved

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.750
or covered things up,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.720
or that the company is still
breaking the law today,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.160
show us evidence.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.070
Also,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.160
you say the woman in the fire

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.070
is my mother,

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.880
but I don't accept that.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.920
I can show you
my mom's death certificate.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.270
You mentioned

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.790
you want to collect my DNA sample.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:11.960
I'm sorry.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.750
It's against the rules.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:15.030
Alright.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:19.440
Then

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.270
we'll need to take your mother's
personal belongings

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.240
for examination.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.550
Gao Feng claims he identified

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.500
the woman in the fire

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.790
based on a golden ball pendant
and a portrait of your mother.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.440
He claims?

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.350
Do you have that golden ball?

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.510
Maybe you should rein in your trainee.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.030
If she keeps asking like this,

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.030
isn't that eliciting a confession?

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.310
I don't know anything
about a golden ball pendant.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.030
But I can show you

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.550
the portrait you mentioned.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.030
(Every moment in life is a choice.)

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.320
(Some choices lead to light,)

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.800
(others lead to hell.)

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.580
(Even when your judgment is clouded,)

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.710
(you still have to choose.)

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.070
Sorry about this.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.550
We hired the new cleaners.
They weren't experienced.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.800
They thought the painting
was waterproof

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.990
and wiped it with a wet cloth.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.920
Everything my mom left behind is here.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.550
See if you need it.

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.070
My mom passed away long ago.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:53.770
The person you're talking about

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.670
is not her.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.110
That woman has nothing to do with me.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.590
We'll compensate

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.590
for your mother's death.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.000
As the developer of Penglai Plaza,

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.090
I'll cooperate fully
with all police investigations

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.280
into the company's past.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.230
I've made my stance.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.510
You can ask Su Min.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.840
I'm in full control of the company.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
If there were any shady dealings
in the past,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.230
I will give the public and the police
an explanation.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.590
But stop making things up

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.000
about my mother.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.400
Wu Feifei, you're not like your dad.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.900
Don't sweep everything under the rug.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:05.800
Gao Feng,

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360
stay away from my family.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:30.300
(Chongqing Home-style Cuisine)

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.010
When did you find out

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.660
about the relationship
between Madam He and Wu Guohao?

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.560
Just a few days ago.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.880
Why didn't you tell me right away?

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.550
Fine. I'll explain it again.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.070
When I got to the fire scene,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.030
I saw Madam He wearing
a golden ball pendant.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.280
The same one my mom had.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.280
So I took it.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.840
I didn't have any other evidence.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.230
I figured I could use this

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.670
to negotiate with Wu Guohao

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.920
and see if I could confirm
their connection.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.230
Verifying facts is the police's job.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.400
What did you promise me
outside the hospital that day?

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.030
Do you realize that what you did

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.480
could count as tampering with
or destroying evidence?

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.630
Do you know how serious that is?

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.550
We'll deal with your negligence

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.550
and responsibility later.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.960
This golden ball pendant

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.550
is the only thing my mom left me.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.390
I've worn it since I was little.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.800
I was just too eager

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.480
to find out how my mom died.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:59.030
So when I saw Madam He

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.760
wearing the same one at the fire,

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.440
I was stunned.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.030
I don't know

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.400
what kind of relationship they had.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.190
But I was scared.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.390
I was scared that everything
was somehow connected to me.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.590
I was scared that my mom would die
because of me.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.800
And

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.440
I really did want to
give Wu Feifei a chance.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.550
Not everyone can turn in
their own family,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.630
especially someone she has depended on
her whole life.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.110
You may not understand,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.510
but that's how I honestly feel.

00:38:49.611 --> 00:38:51.000
Take this as evidence.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.440
I'm not sure if it'll help.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.110
Look into it or test it if needed.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:58.790
When you're done,

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.590
return it to me exactly as it was.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.550
I'm sorry.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.230
Have some shrimp.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.230
Eat more.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.150
It's nutritious.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.590
It helps you recover faster.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.800
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.030
Here. Have some vegetables.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.400
Didn't you promise

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.960
to eat all three deals with me?

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.360
You cook tomorrow.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.480
Don't mind me.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.550
Just eat.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.150
Eat this. It'll help you heal faster.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.070
I had someone check your fortune.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.110
Next year.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.510
Next year is perfect for you two

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.110
to get married.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.150
Long Yu.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.550
You two need to think this through.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.150
Once these videotapes are handed in,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.110
everything about the company
and Mr. Xu in the past

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.590
will be dragged back into the open.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.440
The company's stock price
and reputation

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.550
are bound to take a hit.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.190
That's certainly not the worst part.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.190
Worst case, we start over.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.000
But Yang's dad...

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.510
Dad,

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.440
we agreed I'd handle this.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.360
Dad.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.520
Feifei and Lawyer Cao
are doing the right thing.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.880
If these things were done by my dad,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.480
then as his son, I have to face them.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.330
There's no running from it.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.880
Yes, turning in the evidence now

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.190
will affect the company.

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:21.630
But as long as you're still here,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.960
I believe we'll have a chance
to bounce back.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:25.920
And it makes sense

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.840
for me to hand it in.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.070
I'll say they were
my dad's belongings.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.730
I never looked through them.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.800
There's always a way to explain it.

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.840
Yang,

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.000
Mr. Xu is a good man.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.000
He helped a lot of people.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:43.110
I'm the one who benefited the most.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.360
Every generation has its own stories.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.070
What my dad did

00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.000
caused trouble for all of you.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.840
Don't say that. No.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.070
It's my fault.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.920
Mr. Xu has been gone for so many years,

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.360
and I still haven't
settled things properly.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.000
No. You did everything you could.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:11.840
Even Feifei's mom...

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:17.960
Alright.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.190
This ends here.

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.390
If the storm comes, let it come.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.960
We'll face it together.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.150
Once Lawyer Cao finishes all the plans,

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.030
I'll turn everything in.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.960
That's the plan.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.280
Let him alone.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.630
Making this decision

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.400
wasn't easy.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.320
Put yourself in his shoes.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.920
If one day,

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.920
something happened to me,

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.150
