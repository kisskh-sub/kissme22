WEBVTT

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
Secretary Lin, are you joking with me?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.760
Right?

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.959
Boss, I'm very sorry.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.000
Alright, I understand.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.560
What's the reason?

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.000
It's really just a personal reason.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.439
I need some time for myself.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.239
President Qin, don't worry.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.400
I will find a new secretary as soon as possible.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.239
And ensure a smooth handover of duties.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.799
What is it?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.760
What?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.239
What is the personal reason?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.680
My girlfriend is coming back to the country soon.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.079
We're planning to get married.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.719
Not here yet?

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.159
Driver, sorry to trouble you to wait a bit longer.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.439
Just a little drink.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.800
Just a little drink, okay?

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.280
Otherwise, if I can't sleep tomorrow,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.599
I'll get dark circles again.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.759
Sis.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.800
You think drinking now won't give you dark circles?

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.960
Give me a break.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.199
There's a networking event tomorrow.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.800
I really don't have time to play with you.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.159
Good sister.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.639
I really can't sleep.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.599
Young Lady Qin.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.960
I really need to remind you.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.879
The world doesn't revolve around you alone.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.599
You think everyone is like that Secretary Lin,

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.840
able to be at your beck and call?

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.439
But the one I'm talking about is exactly that...

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.080
No more "buts."

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.879
Bye.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.240
Tofu.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.639
Mommy's going to sleep now.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.439
Hey.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.000
Heartless.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.439
No wonder you got divorced.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.520
Isn't this near Secretary Lin's place?

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.800
How did I end up here?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.120
Secretary Lin.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.879
Hey, wait a minute.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.399
Why am I sneaking around?

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:21.439
Weiwei.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.000
I went to pick you up but didn't see you.

00:04:24.519 --> 00:04:26.040
You must be tired getting in so late.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.639
Where's your luggage?

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.680
Lin Han.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.240
I came to give you closure.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.639
Let's break up.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.800
What did you say?

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.519
You saw it.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.920
I'm already engaged.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.360
Engaged?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.279
I need diamond rings.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.480
I need luxury cars and designer bags.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.040
These are things a mere secretary

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.920
can't give me.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.800
You're kidding, right?

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.720
You call that a luxury car?

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.120
Oh, Secretary Lin.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.800
This girl isn't right for you.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.079
I told you before.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.839
The money I've saved is enough.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:10.439
I'm sorry.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:11.680
The money for studying abroad...

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.600
I will pay you back.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.639
That's not necessary.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.560
But for a secretary,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.720
earning money isn't easy.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.000
I said it's not necessary.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.160
Consider it my tuition fee too.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.839
This girl...

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.079
What's wrong with being a secretary?

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.319
Our Secretary Lin

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.759
is one of a kind.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.439
Stop looking, Secretary Lin.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.160
Go back quickly.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.079
Go back quickly.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.720
Go back, go back.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.720
Yes, yes, yes.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.519
Right, right.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.519
Go back.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.240
You don't want to resign tomorrow anymore, right?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.000
Are you Cupid, the god of love?

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.480
Who is she?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.519
Psyche?

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:29.759
I cannot accept

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.480
a marriage partner I don't know.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.480
What era is this?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480
Still arranging blind marriages?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.399
Weiwei and I have been together since university.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.639
Our relationship is very good.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.839
Very good.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:38.879
If you didn't have money,

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.199
would she have a good relationship with you?

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.480
But I never told her

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.439
about my family background.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.839
So it is Psyche after all.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.600
She doesn't even know your true identity,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.480
yet she fell in love.

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.680
How touching.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.759
I actually have a hopeless romantic for a son.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.279
Old Lin.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.680
Maybe we should meet that girl.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.360
The person our son likes might not be bad.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.160
Meet? No way.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.199
That girl's background

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:01.560
I investigated it long ago.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.800
I do not agree.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.360
If you want to be Jiao Zhongqing,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.839
go hang yourself right now.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.120
Want to bring her into this family?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.920
Impossible.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.000
What you need is an obedient son.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.839
But I am not.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.079
Son.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.040
Let him go.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:14.519
From now on,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.720
don't give him a single cent.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.319
I want to see

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.920
how long his so-called love

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.199
can last.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.560
Wow.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.279
How much is this apartment?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.600
Don't worry.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.160
I found a good job.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.639
The salary and benefits are excellent.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:42.079
It's just that my time isn't entirely my own.

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.639
But your tuition and living expenses are covered.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.600
Lin Han, you're so good to me.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.600
Weiwei.

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:22.879
When you come back,

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:24.439
I'll resign.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.560
We'll get married.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:27.759
Mm-hmm.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.240
Weiwei.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.559
I'll be waiting for you to return.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.759
Hey.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.639
Come pick me up right now.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.879
Happy Break-Up.

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.360
Wish you happiness.

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:03.879
You can find someone better.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.039
Face reality, Secretary Lin.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.279
Follow me,

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.200
and you'll have a brilliant future.

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:23.039
Congratulations on your return, Dragon King.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.480
Welcome back.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:32.039
Um...

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:34.840
Happy Break-Up to you.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.519
Get in the car.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.240
Let's go get late-night snacks.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.039
Let's go to your place first.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.120
Young Master Lin.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.919
Haven't had enough of being willful yet?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.399
You eloped for love.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.919
It's been a full three years now.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.519
If you ask me, you should go home quickly.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:57.279
Let Chairman Lin rest easy too.

00:09:57.279 --> 00:09:57.720
Right?

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.159
Otherwise, he hands everything over to me.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.639
It's exhausting.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.399
Qin Meili still hasn't found a new secretary.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.480
Leaving now...

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.600
...is too irresponsible.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.360
You're quite responsible, huh.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:13.600
Oh, right.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.200
This information...

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.200
...about your love rival.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.919
I've checked it all.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.279
He's just a small-time boss.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.120
He's nothing.

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:21.799
If you don't like the look of him,

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:22.799
we can just...

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.799
Let bygones be bygones.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.120
Fine, I won't pursue it.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:30.919
Let's go for late-night snacks.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.120
Say what you want to eat.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.679
My treat.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:54.240
Boss.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.919
This is regarding the resignation I mentioned yesterday.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:57.960
I hope you will approve it.

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:07.039
Didn't you already break up?

00:11:07.039 --> 00:11:07.840
What did you say?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.039
Nothing.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.840
Come, Secretary Lin, have a seat.

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.440
Come, sit.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.919
Secretary Lin.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.039
Although...

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.480
...you haven't been with the company long,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.000
your performance has been outstanding.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.799
Therefore, the company has decided starting next month...

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.600
...to give you a 200% raise each month.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.840
How about it? Think it over.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:35.080
President Qin.

00:11:35.559 --> 00:11:36.759
The reason for my resignation...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.919
...is not about money.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.000
Oh, right.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.960
The company has also decided...

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.120
...to give you one month of annual leave every year from now on.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.120
Every single year.

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:46.279
How about that?

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.399
Are you seriously tempted now?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.159
Wouldn't this be unfair...

00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:51.879
...to the other employees?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.720
More importantly...

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:55.960
If you really don't want to be a secretary...

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.039
...the company...

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.759
...will also offer you an internal transfer opportunity.

00:12:01.879 --> 00:12:02.440
President Qin.

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.919
I'm just a secretary.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.759
I don't deserve such special treatment from you.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.039
My work...

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.559
...others can also handle.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.480
Secretary Lin.

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.320
Don't sell yourself short.

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:16.279
A high-caliber talent like you, fluent in multiple languages...

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.200
...knowledgeable in finance and accounting...

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.200
...finance, and law...

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:20.840
How could you possibly...

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.519
...be just a secretary?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.039
Rest assured.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.600
With a boss like me...

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.120
...you'll always have your bread.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.639
President Qin.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:34.919
Actually, yesterday I...

00:12:34.919 --> 00:12:36.159
It's fine, Secretary Lin.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.039
Whatever you want...

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.039
...just ask.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.639
President Qin, actually...

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:45.480
...yesterday I already had...

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.200
...the Human Resources Department post the job listing.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.000
Since you had no work scheduled today,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.960
I took the liberty of scheduling interviews.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:53.759
They are now waiting in the conference room.
